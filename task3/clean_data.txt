This strict single-point-of-departure fic - exists primary point departure, point past, also alterations. The best term I've heard fic "parallel universe".  The text contains many clues: obvious clues, not-so-obvious clues, truly obscure hints I shocked see readers successfully decode, massive evidence left plain sight. This rationalist story; mysteries solvable, meant solved.  The pacing story serial fiction, i.e., TV show running predetermined number seasons, whose episodes individually plotted overall arc building final conclusion.  The story corrected British English Ch. 17, Britpicking currently progress (see /HPMOR subreddit).  All science mentioned real science. But please keep mind that, beyond realm science, views characters may author. Not everything protagonist lesson wisdom, advice offered darker characters may untrustworthy dangerously double-edged.   Beneath moonlight glints tiny fragment silver, fraction line...  (black robes, falling)  ...blood spills litres, someone screams word.   Every inch wall space covered bookcase. Each bookcase six shelves, going almost ceiling. Some bookshelves stacked brim hardback books: science, maths, history, everything else. Other shelves two layers paperback science fiction, back layer books propped old tissue boxes lengths wood, see back layer books books front. And still enough. Books overflowing onto tables sofas making little heaps windows.  This living-room house occupied eminent Professor Michael Verres-Evans, wife, Mrs. Petunia Evans-Verres, adopted son, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres.  There letter lying living-room table, unstamped envelope yellowish parchment, addressed Mr. H. Potter emerald-green ink.  The Professor wife speaking sharply other, shouting. The Professor considers shouting uncivilised.  "You're joking," Michael said Petunia. His tone indicated much afraid serious.  "My sister witch," Petunia repeated. She looked frightened, stood ground. "Her husband wizard."  "This absurd!" Michael said sharply. "They wedding - visited Christmas -"  "I told know," Petunia whispered. "But true. I've seen things -"  The Professor rolled eyes. "Dear, I understand familiar sceptical literature. You may realise easy trained magician fake seemingly impossible. Remember I taught Harry bend spoons? If seemed like could always guess thinking, that's called cold reading -"  "It bending spoons -"  "What it, then?"  Petunia bit lip. "I can't tell you. You'll think I'm -" She swallowed. "Listen. Michael. I - always like -" She gestured herself, though indicate lithe form. "Lily this. Because I - I begged her. For years, I begged her. Lily always prettier me, I'd... mean her, that, got magic, imagine I felt? And I begged use magic I could pretty too, even I magic, least I could pretty."  Tears gathering Petunia's eyes.  "And Lily would tell no, make ridiculous excuses, like world would end nice sister, centaur told - ridiculous things, I hated it. And I graduated university, I going boy, Vernon Dursley, fat boy would talk me. And said wanted children, first son would named Dudley. And I thought myself, kind parent names child Dudley Dursley? It like I saw whole future life stretching front me, I stand it. And I wrote sister told help I'd rather -"  Petunia stopped.  "Anyway," Petunia said, voice small, "she gave in. She told dangerous, I said I care more, I drank potion I sick weeks, I got better skin cleared I finally filled and... I beautiful, people nice me," voice broke, "and I hate sister more, especially I learned magic brought end -"  "Darling," Michael said gently, "you got sick, gained weight resting bed, skin cleared own. Or sick made change diet -"  "She witch," Petunia repeated. "I saw it."  "Petunia," Michael said. The annoyance creeping voice. "You know can't true. Do I really explain why?"  Petunia wrung hands. She seemed verge tears. "My love, I know I can't win arguments you, please, trust -"  "Dad! Mum!"  The two stopped looked Harry though they'd forgotten third person room.  Harry took deep breath. "Mum, parents magic, they?"  "No," Petunia said, looking puzzled.  "Then one family knew magic Lily got letter. How get convinced?"  "Ah..." Petunia said. "They send letter. They sent professor Hogwarts. He -" Petunia's eyes flicked Michael. "He showed us magic."  "Then fight this," Harry said firmly. Hoping hope time, once, would listen him. "If true, get Hogwarts professor see magic ourselves, Dad admit true. And not, Mum admit false. That's experimental method for, resolve things arguing."  The Professor turned looked him, dismissive usual. "Oh, come now, Harry. Really, magic? I thought know better take seriously, son, even ten. Magic unscientific thing is!"  Harry's mouth twisted bitterly. He treated well, probably better genetic fathers treated children. Harry sent best primary schools - work out, provided tutors endless pool starving students. Always Harry encouraged study whatever caught attention, bought books caught fancy, sponsored whatever maths science competitions entered. He given anything reasonable wanted, except, maybe, slightest shred respect. A Doctor teaching biochemistry Oxford could hardly expected listen advice little boy. You would listen Show Interest, course; that's Good Parent would do, so, conceived Good Parent, would it. But take ten-year-old seriously? Hardly.  Sometimes Harry wanted scream father.  "Mum," Harry said. "If want win argument Dad, look chapter two first book Feynman Lectures Physics. There's quote philosophers say great deal science absolutely requires, wrong, rule science final arbiter observation - look world report see. Um... top head I can't think find something ideal science settle things experiment instead arguments -"  His mother looked smiled. "Thank you, Harry. But -" head rose back stare husband. "I want win argument father. I want husband to, listen wife loves him, trust -"  Harry closed eyes briefly. Hopeless. Both parents hopeless.  Now parents getting one arguments again, one mother tried make father feel guilty, father tried make mother feel stupid.  "I'm going go room," Harry announced. His voice trembled little. "Please try fight much this, Mum, Dad, we'll know soon enough comes out, right?"  "Of course, Harry," said father, mother gave reassuring kiss, went fighting Harry climbed stairs bedroom.  He shut door behind tried think.  The funny thing was, agreed Dad. No one ever seen evidence magic, according Mum, whole magical world there. How could anyone keep something like secret? More magic? That seemed like rather suspicious sort excuse.  It clean case Mum joking, lying insane, ascending order awfulness. If Mum sent letter herself, would explain arrived letterbox without stamp. A little insanity far, far less improbable universe really working like that.  Except part Harry utterly convinced magic real, since instant saw putative letter Hogwarts School Witchcraft Wizardry.  Harry rubbed forehead, grimacing. Don't believe everything think, one books said.  But bizarre certainty... Harry finding expecting that, yes, Hogwarts professor would show wave wand magic would come out. The strange certainty making effort guard falsification - making excuses advance professor, professor would able bend spoons.  Where come from, strange little prediction? Harry directed thought brain. Why I believe I believe?  Usually Harry pretty good answering question, particular case, clue brain thinking.  Harry mentally shrugged. A flat metal plate door affords pushing, handle door affords pulling, thing testable hypothesis go test it.  He took piece lined paper desk, started writing.  Dear Deputy Headmistress  Harry paused, reflecting; discarded paper another, tapping another millimetre graphite mechanical pencil. This called careful calligraphy.  Dear Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall,  Or Whomsoever It May Concern:  I recently received letter acceptance Hogwarts, addressed Mr. H. Potter. You may aware genetic parents, James Potter Lily Potter (formerly Lily Evans) dead. I adopted Lily's sister, Petunia Evans-Verres, husband, Michael Verres-Evans.  I extremely interested attending Hogwarts, conditional place actually existing. Only mother Petunia says knows magic, can't use herself. My father highly sceptical. I uncertain. I also know obtain books equipment listed acceptance letter.  Mother mentioned sent Hogwarts representative Lily Potter (then Lily Evans) order demonstrate family magic real, and, I presume, help Lily obtain school materials. If could family would extremely helpful.  Sincerely,  Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres.  Harry added current address, folded letter put envelope, addressed Hogwarts. Further consideration led obtain candle drip wax onto flap envelope, which, using penknife's tip, impressed initials H.J.P.E.V. If going descend madness, going style.  Then opened door went back downstairs. His father sitting living-room reading book higher maths show smart was; mother kitchen preparing one father's favourite meals show loving was. It look like talking one another all. As scary arguments could be, arguing somehow much worse.  "Mum," Harry said unnerving silence, "I'm going test hypothesis. According theory, I send owl Hogwarts?"  His mother turned kitchen sink stare him, looking shocked. "I - I know, I think magic owl."  That sounded highly suspicious, oh, there's way test theory then, peculiar certainty Harry seemed willing stick neck even further.  "Well, letter got somehow," Harry said, "so I'll wave around outside call 'letter Hogwarts!' see owl picks up. Dad, want come watch?"  His father shook head minutely kept reading. Of course, Harry thought himself. Magic disgraceful thing stupid people believed in; father went far test hypothesis, even watch tested, would feel like associating that...  Only Harry stumped back door, back garden, occur owl come snatch letter, going trouble telling Dad it.  But - well - can't really happen, it? No matter brain seems believe. If owl really comes grabs envelope, I'm going worries lot important Dad thinks.  Harry took deep breath, raised envelope air.  He swallowed.  Calling Letter Hogwarts! holding envelope high air middle back garden was... actually pretty embarrassing, thought it.  No. I'm better Dad. I use scientific method even makes feel stupid.  "Letter -" Harry said, actually came whispered croak.  Harry steeled will, shouted empty sky, "Letter Hogwarts! Can I get owl?"  "Harry?" asked bemused woman's voice, one neighbours.  Harry pulled hand like fire hid envelope behind back like drug money. His whole face hot shame.  An old woman's face peered neighbouring fence, grizzled grey hair escaping hairnet. Mrs. Figg, occasional babysitter. "What doing, Harry?"  "Nothing," Harry said strangled voice. "Just - testing really silly theory -"  "Did get acceptance letter Hogwarts?"  Harry froze place.  "Yes," Harry's lips said little later. "I got letter Hogwarts. They say want owl 31st July, -"  "But owl. Poor dear! I can't imagine someone must thinking, sending standard letter."  A wrinkled arm stretched fence, opened expectant hand. Hardly even thinking point, Harry gave envelope.  "Just leave me, dear," said Mrs. Figg, "and jiffy two I'll someone over."  And face disappeared fence.  There long silence garden.  Then boy's voice said, calmly quietly, "What."   Chapter 2: Everything I Believe Is False  #include "stddisclaimer.h"   "Of course fault. There's one else could responsible anything."   "Now, clear," Harry said, "if professor levitate you, Dad, know attached wires, that's going sufficient evidence. You're going turn around say magician's trick. That fair play. If feel way, say now, figure different experiment instead."  Harry's father, Professor Michael Verres-Evans, rolled eyes. "Yes, Harry."  "And you, Mum, theory says professor able this, happen, admit mistaken. Nothing magic work people sceptical it, anything like that."  Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall watching Harry bemused expression. She looked quite witchy black robes pointed hat, spoke sounded formal Scottish, go together look all. At first glance looked like someone ought cackle put babies cauldrons, whole effect ruined soon opened mouth. "Is sufficient, Mr. Potter?" said. "Shall I go ahead demonstrate?"  "Sufficient? Probably not," Harry said. "But least help. Go ahead, Deputy Headmistress."  "Just Professor do," said she, then, "Wingardium Leviosa."  Harry looked father.  "Huh," Harry said.  His father looked back him. "Huh," father echoed.  Then Professor Verres-Evans looked back Professor McGonagall. "All right, put now."  His father lowered carefully ground.  Harry ruffled hand hair. Maybe strange part already convinced, but... "That's bit anticlimax," Harry said. "You'd think there'd kind dramatic mental event associated updating observation infinitesimal probability -" Harry stopped himself. Mum, witch, even Dad giving look again. "I mean, finding everything I believe false."  Seriously, dramatic. His brain ought flushing entire current stock hypotheses universe, none allowed happen. But instead brain seemed going, All right, I saw Hogwarts Professor wave wand make father rise air, what?  The witch-lady smiling benevolently upon them, looking quite amused. "Would like demonstration, Mr. Potter?"  "You to," Harry said. "We've performed definitive experiment. But..." Harry hesitated. He help himself. Actually, circumstances, helping himself. It right proper curious. "What else do?"  Professor McGonagall turned cat.  Harry scrambled back unthinkingly, backpedalling fast tripped stray stack books landed hard bottom thwack. His hands came catch without quite reaching properly, warning twinge shoulder weight came unbraced.  At small tabby cat morphed back robed woman. "I'm sorry, Mr. Potter," said witch, sounding sincere, though corners lips twitching upwards. "I warned you."  Harry breathing short gasps. His voice came choked. "You can't DO that!"  "It's Transfiguration," said Professor McGonagall. "An Animagus transformation, exact."  "You turned cat! A SMALL cat! You violated Conservation Energy! That's arbitrary rule, implied form quantum Hamiltonian! Rejecting destroys unitarity get FTL signalling! And cats COMPLICATED! A human mind can't visualise whole cat's anatomy and, cat biochemistry, neurology? How go thinking using cat-sized brain?"  Professor McGonagall's lips twitching harder now. "Magic."  "Magic enough that! You'd god!"  Professor McGonagall blinked. "That's first time I've ever called that."  A blur coming Harry's vision, brain started comprehend broken. The whole idea unified universe mathematically regular laws, flushed toilet; whole notion physics. Three thousand years resolving big complicated things smaller pieces, discovering music planets tune falling apple, finding true laws perfectly universal exceptions anywhere took form simple maths governing smallest parts, mention mind brain brain made neurons, brain person -  And woman turned cat, much that.  A hundred questions fought priority Harry's lips winner poured out: "And, kind incantation Wingardium Leviosa? Who invents words spells, nursery schoolers?"  "That do, Mr. Potter," Professor McGonagall said crisply, though eyes shone suppressed amusement. "If wish learn magic, I suggest finalise paperwork go Hogwarts."  "Right," Harry said, somewhat dazed. He pulled thoughts together. The March Reason would start over, all; still experimental method important thing. "How I get Hogwarts, then?"  A choked laugh escaped Professor McGonagall, extracted tweezers.  "Hold moment, Harry," father said. "Remember going school now? What condition?"  Professor McGonagall spun face Michael. "His condition? What's this?"  "I sleep right," Harry said. He waved hands helplessly. "My sleep cycle twenty-six hours long, I always go sleep two hours later, every day. I can't fall asleep earlier that, next day I go sleep two hours later that. 10PM, 12AM, 2AM, 4AM, goes around clock. Even I try wake early, makes difference I'm wreck whole day. That's I going normal school now."  "One reasons," said mother. Harry shot glare.  McGonagall gave long hmmmmm. "I can't recall hearing condition before..." said slowly. "I'll check Madam Pomfrey see knows remedies." Then face brightened. "No, I'm sure problem - I'll find solution time. Now," gaze sharpened again, "what reasons?"  Harry sent parents glare. "I conscientious objector child conscription, grounds I suffer disintegrating school system's failure provide teachers study materials even minimally adequate quality."  Both Harry's parents howled laughter that, like thought big joke. "Oh," said Harry's father, eyes bright, "is bit maths teacher third year."  "She know logarithm was!"  "Of course," seconded Harry's mother. "Biting mature response that."  Harry's father nodded. "A well-considered policy addressing problem teachers understand logarithms."  "I seven years old! How long going keep bringing up?"  "I know," said mother sympathetically, "you bite one maths teacher never let forget it, they?"  Harry turned Professor McGonagall. "There! You see I deal with?"  "Excuse me," said Petunia, fled backdoor garden, screams laughter clearly audible.  "There, ah, there," Professor McGonagall seemed trouble speaking reason, "there biting teachers Hogwarts, quite clear, Mr. Potter?"  Harry scowled her. "Fine, I bite anyone bite first."  Professor Michael Verres-Evans also leave room briefly upon hearing that.  "Well," Professor McGonagall sighed, Harry's parents composed returned. "Well. I think, circumstances, I avoid taking purchase study materials day two school begins."  "What? Why? The children already know magic, they? I start catching right away!"  "Rest assured, Mr. Potter," replied Professor McGonagall, "Hogwarts quite capable teaching basics. And I suspect, Mr. Potter, I leave alone two months schoolbooks, even without wand, I return house find crater billowing purple smoke, depopulated city surrounding plague flaming zebras terrorising remains England."  Harry's mother father nodded perfect unison.  "Mum! Dad!"   Chapter 3: Comparing Reality To Its Alternatives  If J. K. Rowling asks story, know nothing.   "But question - who?"   "Good Lord," said barman, peering Harry, "is - -?"  Harry leaned towards bar Leaky Cauldron best could, though came somewhere around tips eyebrows. A question like deserved best.  "Am I - could I - maybe - never know - I'm - question - who?"  "Bless soul," whispered old barman. "Harry Potter... honour."  Harry blinked, rallied. "Well, yes, quite perceptive; people realise quickly -"  "That's enough," Professor McGonagall said. Her hand tightened Harry's shoulder. "Don't pester boy, Tom, he's new this."  "But him?" quavered old woman. "It's Harry Potter?" With scraping sound, got chair.  "Doris -" McGonagall said warningly. The glare shot around room enough intimidate anyone.  "I want shake hand," woman whispered. She bent low stuck wrinkled hand, Harry, feeling confused uncomfortable ever life, carefully shook. Tears fell woman's eyes onto clasped hands. "My granson Auror," whispered him. "Died seventy-nine. Thank you, Harry Potter. Thank heavens you."  "You're welcome," Harry said automatically, turned head shot Professor McGonagall frightened, pleading look.  Professor McGonagall slammed foot general rush start. It made noise gave Harry new referent phrase "Crack Doom", everyone froze place.  "We're hurry," Professor McGonagall said voice sounded perfectly, utterly normal.  They left bar without trouble.  "Professor?" Harry said, courtyard. He meant ask going on, oddly found asking entirely different question instead. "Who pale man, corner? The man twitching eye?"  "Hm?" said Professor McGonagall, sounding bit surprised; perhaps expected question either. "That Professor Quirinus Quirrell. He'll teaching Defence Against Dark Arts year Hogwarts."  "I strangest feeling I knew him..." Harry rubbed forehead. "And I ought shake hand." Like meeting someone friend, once, something went drastically wrong... really all, Harry find words. "And was... that?"  Professor McGonagall giving odd glance. "Mr. Potter... know... much told... parents died?"  Harry returned steady look. "My parents alive well, always refused talk genetic parents died. From I infer good."  "An admirable loyalty," said Professor McGonagall. Her voice went low. "Though hurts little hear say like that. Lily James friends mine."  Harry looked away, suddenly ashamed. "I'm sorry," said small voice. "But I Mum Dad. And I know I'd make unhappy comparing reality to... something perfect I built imagination."  "That amazingly wise you," Professor McGonagall said quietly. "But genetic parents died well indeed, protecting you."  Protecting me?  Something strange clutched Harry's heart. "What... happen?"  Professor McGonagall sighed. Her wand tapped Harry's forehead, vision blurred moment. "Something disguise," said, "so happen again, ready." Then wand licked again, tapped three times brick wall...  ...which hollowed hole, dilated expanded shivered huge archway, revealing long row shops signs advertising cauldrons dragon livers.  Harry blink. It like anyone turning cat.  And walked forwards, together, wizarding world.  There merchants hawking Bounce Boots ("Made real Flubber!") "Knives +3! Forks +2! Spoons +4 bonus!" There goggles would turn anything looked green, lineup comfy armchairs ejection seats emergencies.  Harry's head kept rotating, rotating like trying wind neck. It like walking magical items section Advanced Dungeons Dragons rulebook (he play game, enjoy reading rulebooks). Harry desperately want miss single item sale, case one three needed complete cycle infinite wish spells.  Then Harry spotted something made him, entirely without thinking, veer Deputy Headmistress start heading straight shop, front blue bricks bronze-metal trim. He brought back reality Professor McGonagall stepped right front him.  "Mr. Potter?" said.  Harry blinked, realised he'd done. "I'm sorry! I forgot moment I instead family." Harry gestured shop window, displayed fiery letters shone piercingly bright yet remote, spelling Bigbam's Brilliant Books. "When walk past bookshop visited before, go look around. That's family rule."  "That Ravenclaw thing I ever heard."  "What?"  "Nothing. Mr. Potter, first step visit Gringotts, bank wizarding world. Your genetic family vault there, inheritance genetic parents left you, need money school supplies." She sighed. "And, I suppose, certain amount spending money books could excused well. Though might want hold time. Hogwarts quite large library magical subjects. And tower which, I strongly suspect, living, broad-ranging library own. Any book bought would probably duplicate."  Harry nodded, walked on.  "Don't get wrong, great distraction," Harry said head kept swivelling, "probably best distraction anyone ever tried me, think I've forgotten pending discussion."  Professor McGonagall sighed. "Your parents - mother rate - may wise tell you."  "So wish I could continue blissful ignorance? There certain flaw plan, Professor McGonagall."  "I suppose would rather pointless," witch said tightly, "when anyone street could tell story. Very well."  And told He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, Dark Lord, Voldemort.  "Voldemort?" Harry whispered. It funny, wasn't. The name burned cold feeling, ruthlessness, diamond clarity, hammer pure titanium descending upon anvil yielding flesh. A chill swept Harry even pronounced word, resolved use safer terms like You-Know-Who.  The Dark Lord raged upon wizarding Britain like wilding wolf, tearing rending fabric everyday lives. Other countries wrung hands hesitated intervene, whether apathetic selfishness simple fear, whichever first among oppose Dark Lord, peace would next target terror.  (The bystander effect, thought Harry, thinking Latane Darley's experiment shown likely get help epileptic fit front one person front three. Diffusion responsibility, everyone hoping someone else would go first.)  The Death Eaters followed Dark Lord's wake vanguard, carrion vultures pick wounds, snakes bite weaken. The Death Eaters terrible Dark Lord, terrible, many. And Death Eaters wielded wands; wealth within masked ranks, political power, secrets held blackmail, paralyse society trying protect itself.  An old respected journalist, Yermy Wibble, called increased taxes conscription. He shouted absurd many cower fear few. His skin, skin, found nailed newsroom wall next morning, next skins wife two daughters. Everyone wished something done, one dared take lead propose it. Whoever stood became next example.  Until names James Lily Potter rose top list.  And two might died wands hands regretted choices, heroes; infant child, son, Harry Potter.  Tears coming Harry's eyes. He wiped away anger maybe desperation, I know people, really, parents now, would pointless feel sad -  When Harry done sobbing witch's robes, looked up, felt little bit better see tears Professor McGonagall's eyes well.  "So happened?" Harry said, voice trembling.  "The Dark Lord came Godric's Hollow," Professor McGonagall said whisper. "You hidden, betrayed. The Dark Lord killed James, killed Lily, came end you, cot. He cast Killing Curse you, ended. The Killing Curse formed pure hate, strikes directly soul, severing body. It cannot blocked, whomever strikes, die. But survived. You person ever survive. The Killing Curse rebounded struck Dark Lord, leaving burnt hulk body scar upon forehead. That end terror, free. That, Harry Potter, people want see scar forehead, want shake hand."  The storm weeping washed Harry used tears; could cry again, done.  (And somewhere back mind small, small note confusion, sense something wrong story; part Harry's art notice tiny note, distracted. For sad rule whenever need art rationalist, likely forget it.)  Harry detached Professor McGonagall's side. "I'll - think this," said, trying keep voice control. He stared shoes. "Um. You go ahead call parents, want, say 'genetic parents' anything. I guess there's reason I can't two mothers two fathers."  There sound Professor McGonagall.  And walked together silence, came great white building vast bronze doors, carven words saying Gringotts Bank.   Chapter 4: The Efficient Market Hypothesis  Disclaimer: J. K. Rowling watching waits, eternally void worlds.  A/N: As others noted, novels seem inconsistent apparent purchasing power Galleon; I'm picking consistent value sticking it. Five pounds sterling Galleon square seven Galleons wand children using hand-me-down wands.   "World domination ugly phrase. I prefer call world optimisation."   Heaps gold Galleons. Stacks silver Sickles. Piles bronze Knuts.  Harry stood there, stared mouth open family vault. He many questions know start.  From outside door vault, Professor McGonagall watched him, seeming lean casually wall, eyes intent. Well, made sense. Being plopped front giant heap gold coins test character pure archetypal.  "Are coins pure metal?" Harry said finally.  "What?" hissed goblin Griphook, waiting near door. "Are questioning integrity Gringotts, Mr. Potter-Evans-Verres?"  "No," said Harry absently, "not all, sorry came wrong, sir. I idea financial system works. I'm asking Galleons general made pure gold."  "Of course," said Griphook.  "And anyone coin them, issued monopoly thereby collects seigniorage?"  "What?" said Professor McGonagall.  Griphook grinned, showing sharp teeth. "Only fool would trust goblin coin!"  "In words," Harry said, "the coins supposed worth metal making up?"  Griphook stared Harry. Professor McGonagall looked bemused.  "I mean, suppose I came ton silver. Could I get ton Sickles made it?"  "For fee, Mr. Potter-Evans-Verres." The goblin watched glittering eyes. "For certain fee. Where would find ton silver, I wonder?"  "I speaking hypothetically," Harry said. For now, rate. "So... much would charge fees, fraction whole weight?"  Griphook's eyes intent. "I would consult superiors..."  "Give wild guess. I hold Gringotts it."  "A twentieth part metal would well pay coining."  Harry nodded. "Thank much, Mr. Griphook."  So wizarding economy almost completely decoupled Muggle economy, one ever heard arbitrage. The larger Muggle economy fluctuating trading range gold silver, every time Muggle gold-to-silver ratio got 5% away weight seventeen Sickles one Galleon, either gold silver drained wizarding economy became impossible maintain exchange rate. Bring ton silver, change Sickles (and pay 5%), change Sickles Galleons, take gold Muggle world, exchange silver started with, repeat.  Wasn't Muggle gold silver ratio somewhere around fifty one? Harry think seventeen, anyway. And looked like silver coins actually smaller gold coins.  Then again, Harry standing bank literally stored money vaults full gold coins guarded dragons, go take coins vault whenever wanted spend money. The finer points arbitraging away market inefficiencies might well lost them. He'd tempted make snide remarks crudity financial system...  But sad thing is, way probably better.  On hand, one competent hedge fundie could probably whole wizarding world within week. Harry filed away notion case ever ran money, week free.  Meanwhile, giant heaps gold coins within Potter vault ought suit near-term requirements.  Harry stumped forward, began picking gold coins one hand dumping other.  When reached twenty, Professor McGonagall coughed. "I think enough pay school supplies, Mr. Potter."  "Hm?" Harry said, mind elsewhere. "Hold on, I'm Fermi calculation."  "A what?" said Professor McGonagall, sounding somewhat alarmed.  "It's mathematical thing. Named Enrico Fermi. A way getting rough numbers quickly head..."  Twenty gold Galleons weighed tenth kilogram, maybe? And gold was, what, ten thousand British pounds kilogram? So Galleon would worth fifty pounds... The mounds gold coins looked sixty coins high twenty coins wide either dimension base, mound pyramidal, would around one-third cube. Eight thousand Galleons per mound, roughly, around five mounds size, forty thousand Galleons 2 million pounds sterling.  Not bad. Harry smiled certain grim satisfaction. It bad right middle discovering amazing new world magic, take time explore amazing new world rich, quick Fermi estimate said roughly billion times less interesting.  Still, that's last time I ever mow lawn one lousy pound.  Harry wheeled giant heap money. "Pardon asking, Professor McGonagall, I understand parents twenties died. Is usual amount money young couple vault, wizarding world?" If was, cup tea probably cost five thousand pounds. Rule one economics: can't eat money.  Professor McGonagall shook head. "Your father last heir old family, Mr. Potter. It's also possible..." The witch hesitated. "Some money may bounties placed You-Know-Who, payable ki- ah, whoever might defeat him. Or bounties might collected yet. I sure."  "Interesting..." Harry said slowly. "So really is, sense, mine. That is, earned me. Sort of. Possibly. Even I remember occasion." Harry's fingers tapped trouser-leg. "That makes feel less guilty spending tiny fraction it! Don't panic, Professor McGonagall!"  "Mr. Potter! You minor, such, allowed make reasonable withdrawals -"  "I reasonable! I totally board fiscal prudence impulse control! But I see things way would constitute sensible, grown-up purchases..."  Harry locked gazes Professor McGonagall, engaging silent staring contest.  "Like what?" Professor McGonagall said finally.  "Trunks whose insides hold outsides?"  Professor McGonagall's face grew stern. "Those expensive, Mr. Potter!"  "Yes, -" Harry pleaded. "I'm sure I'm adult I'll want one. And I afford one. Logically, would make much sense buy instead later, get use right away. It's money either way, right? I mean, I would want good one, lots room inside, good enough I get better one later..." Harry trailed hopefully.  Professor McGonagall's gaze waver. "And would keep trunk like that, Mr. Potter -"  "Books."  "Of course," sighed Professor McGonagall.  "You told much earlier sort magic item existed! And I could afford one! Now father I going to spend next two days frantically hitting secondhand bookshops old textbooks, I decent science library Hogwarts - maybe small science fiction collection, I assemble something decent bargain bins. Or better yet, I'll make deal little sweeter you, okay? Just let buy -"  "Mr. Potter! You think bribe me?"  "What? No! Not like that! I'm saying, Hogwarts keep books I bring, think would make good additions library. I'm going getting cheap, I want around somewhere other. It's okay bribe people books, right? That's -"  "Family tradition."  "Yes, exactly."  Professor McGonagall's body seemed slump, shoulders lowering within black robes. "I cannot deny sense words, though I much wish I could. I allow withdraw additional hundred Galleons, Mr. Potter." She sighed again. "I know I shall regret this, I anyway."  "That's spirit! And 'mokeskin pouch' I think does?"  "It can't much trunk," witch said visible reluctance, "but... mokeskin pouch Retrieval Charm Undetectable Extension Charm hold number items called forth one emplaced -"  "Yes! I definitely need one too! It would like super beltpack ultimate awesomeness! Batman's utility belt holding! Never mind swiss army knife, I could carry whole tool set there! Or books! I could top three books I reading times, pull one anywhere! I'll never waste another minute life! What say, Professor McGonagall? It's sake children's reading, best possible causes."  "...I suppose may add another ten Galleons."  Griphook favouring Harry gaze frank respect, possibly even outright admiration.  "And little spending money, like mentioned earlier. I think I remember seeing one two things I might want store pouch."  "Don't push it, Mr. Potter."  "But oh, Professor McGonagall, rain parade? Surely happy day, I discover things wizarding first time! Why act part grumpy grownup instead could smile remember innocent childhood, watching look delight upon young face I buy toys using insignificant fraction wealth I earned defeating terrible wizard Britain ever known, I'm accusing ungrateful anything, still, toys compared that?"  "You," growled Professor McGonagall. There look face fearsome terrible Harry squeaked stepped back, knocking pile gold coins great jingling noise sprawling backwards heap money. Griphook sighed put palm face. "I would great service wizarding Britain, Mr. Potter, I locked vault left here."  And left without trouble.   Chapter 5: The Fundamental Attribution Error  J. K. Rowling staring you. Can feel eyes you? She's reading mind using Rowling Rays.   "He's eleven years old, Hermione."  "So you."  "I count."   The Moke Shop quaint little shop (some might even say cute) ensconced behind vegetable stall behind magical glove shop alleyway side street Diagon Alley. Disappointingly, shopkeeper wizened ancient crone; nervous-looking young woman wearing faded yellow robes. Right holding Moke Super Pouch QX31, whose selling point Widening Lip well Undetectable Extension Charm: could actually fit big things it, though total volume still limited.  Harry insisted coming straight away, first thing - insisted hard thought could without making Professor McGonagall suspicious. Harry something needed put pouch soon possible. It bag Galleons Professor McGonagall allowed withdraw Gringotts. It Galleons Harry surreptitiously shoved pocket falling heap gold coins. That real accident, Harry never one discard opportunity... though it'd really spur-of-the-moment thing. Ever since Harry awkwardly carrying allowed bag Galleons next trouser pocket, jingling would seem come right place.  This still left question actually going get coins pouch without getting caught. The golden coins might his, still stolen - self-stolen? Auto-thieved?  Harry looked Moke Super Pouch QX31 counter front him. "Can I try bit? To make sure works, um, reliably?" He widened eyes expression boyish, playful innocence.  Sure enough, ten repetitions putting coin-bag pouch, reaching in, whispering "bag gold", taking out, Professor McGonagall took step away began examining items shop, shopkeeper turned head watch.  Harry dropped bag gold mokeskin pouch left hand; right hand came pocket tightly holding gold coins, reached mokeskin pouch, dropped loose Galleons, (with whisper "bag gold") retrieved original bag. Then bag went back left hand, dropped again, Harry's right hand went back pocket...  Professor McGonagall looked back once, Harry managed avoid freezing flinching, seem notice anything. Though never quite know, adults sense humour. It took three iterations get job done, Harry guessed he'd managed steal maybe thirty Galleons himself.  Harry reached up, wiped bit sweat forehead, exhaled. "I'd like one, please."  Fifteen Galleons lighter (twice price wizard's wand, apparently) one Moke Super Pouch QX31 heavier, Harry Professor McGonagall pushed way door. The door formed hand waved goodbye left, extruding arm way made Harry feel bit queasy.  And then, unfortunately...  "Are really Harry Potter?" whispered old man, one huge tear sliding cheek. "You lie that, would you? Only I'd heard rumours really survive Killing Curse that's one ever heard again."  ...it seemed Professor McGonagall's disguise spell less perfectly effective experienced magical practitioners.  Professor McGonagall laid hand Harry's shoulder yanked nearest alleyway moment she'd heard "Harry Potter?" The old man followed, least looked like one else heard.  Harry considered question. Was really Harry Potter? "I know people told me," Harry said. "It's like I remember born." His hand brushed forehead. "I've scar long I remember, I've told name Harry Potter long I remember. But," Harry said thoughtfully, "if there's already sufficient cause postulate conspiracy, there's reason find another orphan raise believe Harry Potter -"  Professor McGonagall drew hand face exasperation. "You look exactly like father, James, year first attended Hogwarts. And I attest basis personality alone related Scourge Gryffindor."  "She could too," Harry observed.  "No," quavered old man. "She's right. You mother's eyes."  "Hmm," Harry frowned. "I suppose could -"  "Enough, Mr. Potter."  The old man raised hand touch Harry, let fall. "I'm glad alive," murmured. "Thank you, Harry Potter. Thank did... I'll leave alone now."  And cane slowly tapped away, alley main street Diagon Alley.  The Professor looked around, expression tense grim. Harry automatically looked around himself. But alley seemed empty old leaves, mouth leading Diagon Alley, swiftly striding passersby could seen.  Finally Professor McGonagall seemed relax. "That well done," said low voice. "I know used this, Mr. Potter, people care you. Please kind them."  Harry looked shoes. "They shouldn't," said tinge bitterness. "Care me, I mean."  "You saved You-Know-Who," said Professor McGonagall. "How care?"  Harry looked witch-lady's strict expression beneath pointed hat, sighed. "I suppose there's chance I said fundamental attribution error idea meant."  "No," said Professor precise Scottish accent, "but please explain, Mr. Potter, would kind."  "Well..." Harry said, trying figure describe particular bit Muggle science. "Suppose come work see colleague kicking desk. You think, 'what angry person must be'. Your colleague thinking someone bumped wall way work shouted him. Anyone would angry that, thinks. When look others see personality traits explain behaviour, look see circumstances explain behaviour. People's stories make internal sense them, inside, see people's histories trailing behind air. We see one situation, see would like different situation. So fundamental attribution error explain permanent, enduring traits would better explained circumstance context." There elegant experiments confirmed this, Harry go them.  The witch's eyebrows drew beneath hat's brim. "I think I understand..." Professor McGonagall said slowly. "But you?"  Harry kicked brick wall alley hard enough make foot hurt. "People think I saved You-Know-Who I'm kind great warrior Light."  "The one power vanquish Dark Lord..." murmured witch, strange irony leavening voice.  "Yes," Harry said, annoyance frustration warring him, "like I destroyed Dark Lord I kind permanent, enduring destroy-the-Dark-Lord trait. I fifteen months old time! I know happened, I would suppose something with, saying goes, contingent environmental circumstances. And certainly nothing personality. People care me, even paying attention me, want shake hands bad explanation." Harry paused, looked McGonagall. "Do know really happened?"  "I formed idea..." said Professor McGonagall. "After meeting you, is."  "Yes?"  "You triumphed Dark Lord awful was, survived Killing Curse terrible Death."  "Ha. Ha. Ha." Harry kicked wall again.  Professor McGonagall chuckled. "Let's get Madam Malkin's next. I fear Muggle clothing may attracting attention."  They ran two well-wishers along way.  Madam Malkin's Robes genuinely boring shopfront, red ordinary brick, glass windows showing plain black robes within. Not robes shone changed spun, radiated strange rays seemed go right shirt tickle you. Just plain black robes, could see window. The door propped wide open, advertise secrets nothing hide.  "I'm going go minutes get fitted robes," said Professor McGonagall. "Will right that, Mr. Potter?"  Harry nodded. He hated clothes shopping fiery passion blame older witch feeling way.  Professor McGonagall's wand came sleeve, tapped Harry's head lightly. "And need clear Madam Malkin's senses, I removing Obfuscation."  "Uh..." Harry said. That worry little; still used 'Harry Potter' thing.  "I went Hogwarts Madam Malkin," McGonagall said. "Even then, one composed people I knew. She turn hair You-Know-Who walked shop." McGonagall's voice reminiscent, approving. "Madam Malkin bother you, let anyone else bother you."  "Where going?" Harry inquired. "Just case, know, something happen."  McGonagall gave Harry hard look. "I going there," said, pointing building across street showed sign wooden keg, "and buying drink, I desperately need. You get fitted robes, nothing else. I come back check shortly, I expect find Madam Malkin's shop still standing way fire."  Madam Malkin bustling old woman say word Harry saw scar forehead, shot sharp look assistant girl seemed say something. Madam Malkin got set animated, writhing bits cloth seemed serve tape measures set work examining medium art.  Next Harry, pale young boy pointed face awesomecool blonde-white hair seemed going final stages similar process. One Malkin's two assistants examining white-haired boy chequerboard-gridded robe wearing; occasionally would tap corner robe wand, robe would loosen tighten.  "Hello," said boy. "Hogwarts, too?"  Harry could predict conversation go, decided split second frustration enough enough.  "Good heavens," whispered Harry, "it be." He let eyes widen. "Your... name, sir?"  "Draco Malfoy," said Draco Malfoy, looking slightly puzzled.  "It you! Draco Malfoy. I - I never thought I'd honoured, sir." Harry wished could make tears come eyes. The others usually started crying around point.  "Oh," said Draco, sounding little confused. Then lips stretched smug smile. "It's good meet someone knows place."  One assistants, one who'd seemed recognise Harry, made muffled choking sound.  Harry burbled on. "I'm delighted meet you, Mr. Malfoy. Just unutterably delighted. And attending Hogwarts year! It makes heart swoon."  Oops. That last part might sounded little odd, like flirting Draco something.  "And I pleased learn I shall treated respect due family Malfoy," boy lobbed back, accompanied smile highest kings might bestow upon least subjects, subject honest, though poor.  Eh... Damn, Harry trouble thinking next line. Well, everyone want shake hand Harry Potter, - "When clothes fitted, sir, might deign shake hand? I wish nothing put capper upon day, nay, month, indeed, whole lifetime."  The white-blonde-haired boy glared return. "And done Malfoys entitles favour?"  Oh, I totally trying routine next person wants shake hand. Harry bowed head. "No, no, sir, I understand. I'm sorry asking. I honoured clean boots, rather."  "Indeed," snapped boy. His stern face lightened somewhat. "Tell me, House think might sorted into? I'm bound Slytherin House, course, like father Lucius me. And you, I'd guess House Hufflepuff, possibly House Elf."  Harry grinned sheepishly. "Professor McGonagall says I'm Ravenclaw person ever seen heard tell legend, much Rowena would tell get more, whatever means, I'll undoubtedly end Ravenclaw House hat screaming loudly rest us make words, end quote."  "Wow," said Draco Malfoy, sounding slightly impressed. The boy gave sort wistful sigh. "Your flattery great, I thought so, anyway - well Slytherin House, too. Usually father gets sort grovelling. I'm hoping Slytherins suck I'm Hogwarts... I guess good sign, then."  Harry coughed. "Actually, sorry, I've got idea really."  "Oh come on!" boy said fierce disappointment. "Why'd go that, then?" Draco's eyes widened sudden suspicion. "And know Malfoys? And clothes wearing? Are parents Muggles?"  "Two parents dead," Harry said. His heart twinged. When put way - "My two parents Muggles, they're ones raised me."  "What?" said Draco. "Who you?"  "Harry Potter, pleased meet you."  "Harry Potter?" gasped Draco. "The Harry -" boy cut abruptly.  There brief silence.  Then, bright enthusiasm, "Harry Potter? The Harry Potter? Gosh, I've always wanted meet you!"  Draco's attendant emitted sound like strangling kept work, lifting Draco's arms carefully remove chequered robe.  "Shut up," Harry suggested.  "Can I autograph? No, wait, I want picture first!"  "Shutupshutupshutup."  "I'm delighted meet you!"  "Burst flames die."  "But Harry Potter, glorious saviour wizarding world! Everyone's hero, Harry Potter! I've always wanted like I grow I -"  Draco cut words mid-sentence, face freezing absolute horror.  Tall, white-haired, coldly elegant black robes finest quality. One hand gripping silver-handled cane took character deadly weapon hand. His eyes regarded room dispassionate quality executioner, man killing painful, even deliciously forbidden, routine activity like breathing.  That man had, moment, strolled open door.  "Draco," said man, low angry, "what saying?"  In one split second sympathetic panic, Harry formulated rescue plan.  "Lucius Malfoy!" gasped Harry Potter. "The Lucius Malfoy?"  One Malkin's assistants turn away face wall.  Coolly murderous eyes regarded him. "Harry Potter."  "I so, honoured meet you!"  The dark eyes widened, shocked surprise replacing deadly threat.  "Your son telling you," Harry gushed on, hardly even knowing coming mouth talking fast possible. "But course I knew then, everyone knows you, great Lucius Malfoy! The honoured laureate House Slytherin, I've thinking trying get Slytherin House I heard child -"  "What saying, Mr. Potter?" came near-scream outside shop, Professor McGonagall burst second later.  There pure horror face Harry's mouth opened automatically, blocked nothing-to-say.  "Professor McGonagall!" cried Draco. "Is really you? I've heard much father, I've thinking trying get Sorted Gryffindor I -"  "What?" bellowed Lucius Malfoy Professor McGonagall perfect unison, standing side-by-side. Their heads swivelled look duplicate motions, two recoiled one another though performing synchronised dance.  There sudden flurry action Lucius seized Draco dragged shop.  And silence.  In Professor McGonagall's left hand lay small drinking-glass, tilted one side forgotten rush, slowly dripping drops alcohol tiny puddle red wine appeared floor.  Professor McGonagall strode forward shop opposite Madam Malkin.  "Madam Malkin," said Professor McGonagall, voice calm. "What happening here?"  Madam Malkin looked back silently four seconds, cracked up. She fell wall, wheezing laughter, set assistants, one fell hands knees floor, giggling hysterically.  Professor McGonagall slowly turned look Harry, expression chilly. "I leave alone six minutes. Six minutes, Mr. Potter, clock."  "I joking around," Harry protested, sounds hysterical laughter went nearby.  "Draco Malfoy said front father wanted sorted Gryffindor! Joking around enough that!" Professor McGonagall paused, visibly taking breaths. "What part 'get fitted robes' sounded like please cast Confundus Charm entire universe!"  "He situational context actions made internal sense -"  "No. Don't explain. I want know happened here, ever. Whatever dark power inhabits you, contagious, I want end like poor Draco Malfoy, poor Madam Malkin two poor assistants."  Harry sighed. It clear Professor McGonagall mood listen reasonable explanations. He looked Madam Malkin, still wheezing wall, Malkin's two assistants, fallen knees, finally tape-measure-draped body.  "I'm quite done fitted clothes," Harry said kindly. "Why go back another drink?"   Chapter 6: The Planning Fallacy  Blah blah disclaimer blah blah Rowling blah blah ownership.  A/N: The "Aftermath" section chapter part story, omake.   You think day surreal? Try mine.   Some children would waited first trip Diagon Alley.  "Bag element 79," Harry said, withdrew hand, empty, mokeskin pouch.  Most children would least waited get wands first.  "Bag okane," said Harry. The heavy bag gold popped hand.  Harry withdrew bag, plunged mokeskin pouch. He took hand, put back in, said, "Bag tokens economic exchange." That time hand came empty.  "Give back bag I put in." Out came bag gold more.  Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres gotten hands least one magical item. Why wait?  "Professor McGonagall," Harry said bemused witch strolling beside him, "can give two words, one word gold, one word something else money, language I know? But tell which."  "Ahava zahav," said Professor McGonagall. "That's Hebrew, word means love."  "Thank you, Professor. Bag ahava." Empty.  "Bag zahav." And popped hand.  "Zahav gold?" Harry questioned, Professor McGonagall nodded.  Harry thought collected experimental data. It crude preliminary sort effort, enough support least one conclusion:  "Aaaaaaarrrgh make sense!"  The witch beside lifted lofty eyebrow. "Problems, Mr. Potter?"  "I falsified every single hypothesis I had! How know 'bag 115 Galleons' okay 'bag 90 plus 25 Galleons'? It count can't add? It understand nouns, noun phrases mean thing? The person made probably speak Japanese I speak Hebrew, using knowledge, using knowledge -" Harry waved hand helplessly. "The rules seem sorta consistent mean anything! I'm even going ask pouch ends voice recognition natural language understanding best Artificial Intelligence programmers can't get fastest supercomputers thirty-five years hard work," Harry gasped breath, "but going on?"  "Magic," said Professor McGonagall.  "That's word! Even tell that, I can't make new predictions! It's exactly like saying 'phlogiston' 'elan vital' 'emergence' 'complexity'!"  The black-robed witch laughed aloud. "But magic, Mr. Potter."  Harry slumped little. "With respect, Professor McGonagall, I'm quite sure understand I'm trying here."  "With respect, Mr. Potter, I'm quite sure I don't. Unless - guess, mind - trying take world?"  "No! I mean yes - well, no!"  "I think I perhaps alarmed trouble answering question."  Harry glumly considered Dartmouth Conference Artificial Intelligence 1956. It first conference ever topic, one coined phrase "Artificial Intelligence". They identified key problems making computers understand language, learn, improve themselves. They suggested, perfect seriousness, significant advances problems might made ten scientists working together two months.  No. Chin up. You're starting problem unravelling secrets magic. You actually know whether going difficult two months.  "And really heard wizards asking sorts questions sort scientific experimenting?" Harry asked again. It seemed obvious him.  Then again, it'd taken two hundred years invention scientific method Muggle scientists thought systematically investigate sentences human four-year-old could understand. The developmental psychology linguistics could've discovered eighteenth century, principle, one even thought look twentieth. So really blame much smaller wizarding world investigating Retrieval Charm.  Professor McGonagall pursed lips, shrugged. "I'm still sure mean 'scientific experimenting', Mr. Potter. As I said, I've seen Muggleborn students try get Muggle science work inside Hogwarts, people invent new Charms Potions every year."  Harry shook head. "Technology thing science all. And trying lots different ways something experimenting figure rules." There plenty people who'd tried invent flying machines trying lots things-with-wings, Wright Brothers built wind tunnel measure lift... "Um, many Muggle-raised children get Hogwarts every year?"  "Perhaps ten so?"  Harry missed step almost tripped feet. "Ten?"  The Muggle world population six billion counting. If one million, seven London thousand China. It inevitable Muggle population would produce eleven-year-olds could calculus - Harry knew one. He'd met prodigies mathematical competitions. In fact he'd thoroughly trounced competitors probably spent literally day practising maths problems who'd never read science-fiction book would burn completely puberty never amount anything future lives they'd practised known techniques instead learning think creatively. (Harry something sore loser.)  But... wizarding world...  Ten Muggle-raised children per year, who'd ended Muggle educations age eleven? And Professor McGonagall might biased, claimed Hogwarts largest eminent wizarding school world... educated age seventeen.  Professor McGonagall undoubtedly knew every last detail went turning cat. But seemed literally never heard scientific method. To Muggle magic. And even seem curious secrets might hiding behind natural language understanding Retrieval Charm.  That left two possibilities, really.  Possibility one: Magic incredibly opaque, convoluted, impenetrable, even though wizards witches tried best understand, they'd made little progress eventually given up; Harry would better.  Or...  Harry cracked knuckles determination, made quiet sort clicking sound, rather echoing ominously walls Diagon Alley.  Possibility two: He'd taking world.  Eventually. Perhaps right away.  That sort thing sometimes take longer two months. Muggle science gone moon first week Galileo.  But Harry still stop huge smile stretching cheeks wide starting hurt.  Harry always frightened ending one child prodigies never amounted anything spent rest lives boasting far ahead they'd age ten. But adult geniuses never amounted anything either. There probably thousand people intelligent Einstein every actual Einstein history. Because geniuses gotten hands one thing absolutely needed achieve greatness. They'd never found important problem.  You're mine now, Harry thought walls Diagon Alley, shops items, shopkeepers customers; lands people wizarding Britain, wider wizarding world; entire greater universe Muggle scientists understood much less believed. I, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, claim territory name Science.  Lightning thunder completely failed flash boom cloudless skies.  "What smiling about?" inquired Professor McGonagall, warily wearily.  "I'm wondering there's spell make lightning flash background whenever I make ominous resolution," explained Harry. He carefully memorising exact words ominous resolution future history books would get right.  "I distinct feeling I ought something this," sighed Professor McGonagall.  "Ignore it, it'll go away. Ooh, shiny!" Harry put thoughts world conquest temporarily hold skipped shop open display, Professor McGonagall followed.   Harry bought potions ingredients cauldron, and, oh, things. Items seemed like good things carry Harry's Bag Holding (aka Moke Super Pouch QX31 Undetectable Extension Charm, Retrieval Charm, Widening Lip). Smart, sensible purchases.  Harry genuinely understand Professor McGonagall looking suspicious.  Right now, Harry shop expensive enough display twisting main street Diagon Alley. The shop open front merchandise laid slanted wooden rows, guarded slight grey glows young-looking salesgirl much-shortened version witch's robes exposed knees elbows.  Harry examining wizarding equivalent first-aid kit, Emergency Healing Pack Plus. There two self-tightening tourniquets. A Stabilisation Potion, would slow blood loss prevent shock. A syringe looked like liquid fire, supposed drastically slow circulation treated area maintaining oxygenation blood three minutes, needed prevent poison spreading body. White cloth could wrapped part body temporarily numb pain. Plus number items Harry totally failed comprehend, like "Dementor Exposure Treatment", looked smelled like ordinary chocolate. Or "Bafflesnaffle Counter", looked like small quivering egg carried placard showing jam someone's nostril.  "A definite buy five Galleons, agree?" Harry said Professor McGonagall, teenage salesgirl hovering nearby nodded eagerly.  Harry expected Professor make sort approving remark prudence preparedness.  What getting instead could described Evil Eye.  "And why," Professor McGonagall said heavy scepticism, "do expect need healer's kit, young man?" (After unfortunate incident Potions shop, Professor McGonagall trying avoid saying "Mr. Potter" anyone else nearby.)  Harry's mouth opened closed. "I expect need it! It's case!"  "Just case what?"  Harry's eyes widened. "You think I'm planning something dangerous that's I want medical kit?"  A look grim suspicion ironic disbelief answer.  "Great Scott!" said Harry. (This expression he'd learned mad scientist Doc Brown Back Future.) "Were also thinking I bought Feather-Falling Potion, Gillyweed, bottle Food Water Pills?"  "Yes."  Harry shook head amazement. "Just sort plan think I going, here?"  "I know," Professor McGonagall said darkly, "but ends either delivering ton silver Gringotts, world domination."  "World domination ugly phrase. I prefer call world optimisation."  This hilarious joke failed reassure witch giving Look Doom.  "Wow," Harry said, realised serious. "You really think that. You really think I'm planning something dangerous."  "Yes."  "Like that's reason anyone would ever buy first-aid kit? Don't take wrong way, Professor McGonagall, sort crazy children used dealing with?"  "Gryffindors," spat Professor McGonagall, word carrying freight bitterness despair fell like eternal curse youthful enthusiasm high spirits.  "Deputy Headmistress Professor Minerva McGonagall," Harry said, putting hands sternly hips. "I going Gryffindor -"  At point Deputy Headmistress interjected something would figure kill hat, odd remark Harry let pass without comment, though salesgirl seemed sudden coughing fit.  "- I going Ravenclaw. And really think I'm planning something dangerous, then, honestly, understand all. I like danger, scary. I prudent. I cautious. I preparing unforeseen contingencies. Like parents used sing me: Be prepared! That's Boy Scout's marching song! Be prepared! As life march along! Don't nervous, flustered, scared - prepared!"  (Harry's parents fact ever sung particular lines Tom Lehrer song, Harry blissfully unaware rest.)  Professor McGonagall's stance slightly softened - though mostly Harry said heading Ravenclaw. "What sort contingency imagine kit might prepare for, young man?"  "One classmates gets bitten horrible monster, I scrabble frantically mokeskin pouch something could help her, looks sadly last breath says, 'Why prepared?' And dies, I know eyes close ever forgive -"  Harry heard salesgirl gasp, looked see staring lips pressed tight. Then young woman whirled fled deeper recesses shop.  What...?  Professor McGonagall reached down, took Harry's hand hers, gently firmly, pulled Harry main street Diagon Alley, leading alleyway two shops paved dirty bricks dead-ended wall solid black dirt.  The tall witch pointed wand main street spoke, "Quietus" said, screen silence descended around them, blocking street noises.  What I wrong...  Professor McGonagall turned regard Harry. She full adult Wrongdoing Face, expression flat, controlled. "You must remember, Mr. Potter," said, "that war country ten years ago. Everyone lost someone, speak friends dying arms - done lightly."  "I - I mean -" The inference dropped like falling stone Harry's exceptionally vivid imagination. He'd talked someone breathing last breath - salesgirl run away - war ended ten years ago girl would eight nine years old, when, when, "I'm sorry, I mean to..." Harry choked up, turned away run older witch's gaze wall dirt blocking way wand yet. "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!"  There came heavy sigh behind him. "I know are, Mr. Potter."  Harry dared peek behind him. Professor McGonagall seemed sad, now. "I'm sorry," Harry said again, feeling wretched. "Did anything like happen -" Harry shut lips slapped hand mouth good measure.  The older witch's face grew little sadder. "You must learn think speak, Mr. Potter, else go life without many friends. That fate many Ravenclaw, I hope yours."  Harry wanted run away. He wanted pull wand erase whole thing Professor McGonagall's memory, back outside shop again, make happen -  "But answer question, Mr. Potter, no, nothing like ever happened me. Certainly I've watched friend breathe last, seven times. But one ever cursed died, I never thought forgive me. Why would say thing, Mr. Potter? Why would even think it?"  "I, I, I," Harry swallowed. "It's I always try imagine worst thing could happen," maybe he'd also joking around little would rather bitten tongue say now.  "What?" said Professor McGonagall. "But why?"  "So I stop happening!"  "Mr. Potter..." older witch's voice trailed off. Then sighed, knelt beside him. "Mr. Potter," said, gently now, "it's responsibility take care students Hogwarts. It's mine. I let anything bad happen anyone else. Hogwarts safest place magical children wizarding world, Madam Pomfrey full healer's office. You need healer's kit all, let alone five-Galleon one."  "But I do!" Harry burst out. "Nowhere perfectly safe! And parents heart attack get accident I go home Christmas - Madam Pomfrey there, I'll need healer's kit -"  "What Merlin's name..." Professor McGonagall said. She stood up, looked Harry expression torn annoyance concern. "There's need think terrible things, Mr. Potter!"  Harry's expression twisted bitterness, hearing that. "Yes is! If think, get hurt yourself, end hurting people!"  Professor McGonagall opened mouth, closed it. The witch rubbed bridge nose, looking thoughtful. "Mr. Potter... I offer listen while... anything like talk about?"  "About what?"  "About convinced must always guard terrible things happening you."  Harry stared puzzlement. That self-evident axiom. "Well..." Harry said slowly. He tried organise thoughts. How could explain Professor-witch, even know basics? "Muggle researchers found people always optimistic, compared reality. Like say something take two days takes ten days, say it'll take two months takes thirty-five years. For example, one experiment, asked students times 50% sure, 75% sure, 99% sure they'd complete homework, 13%, 19%, 45% students finished times. And found reason asked one group best-case estimates everything went well possible, another group average-case estimates everything went usual, got back answers statistically indistinguishable. See, ask someone expect normal case, visualise looks like line maximum probability step along way - everything going according plan, surprises. But actually, since half students finish time 99% sure they'd done, reality usually delivers results little worse 'worst-case scenario'. It's called planning fallacy, best way fix ask long things took last time tried them. That's called using outside view instead inside view. But something new can't that, really, really, really pessimistic. Like, pessimistic reality actually comes better expected around often much comes worse. It's actually really hard pessimistic stand decent chance undershooting real life. Like I make big effort gloomy I imagine one classmates getting bitten, actually happens surviving Death Eaters attack whole school get me. But happier note -"  "Stop," said Professor McGonagall.  Harry stopped. He point least knew Dark Lord attack, since dead.  "I think I might made clear," witch said, precise Scottish voice sounding even careful. "Did anything happen personally frightened you, Mr. Potter?"  "What happened personally anecdotal evidence," Harry explained. "It carry weight replicated, peer-reviewed journal article controlled study random assignment, many subjects, large effect sizes strong statistical significance."  Professor McGonagall pinched bridge nose, inhaled, exhaled. "I would still like hear it," said.  "Um..." Harry said. He took deep breath. "There'd muggings neighborhood, mother asked return pan she'd borrowed neighbor two streets away, I said I want I might get mugged, said, 'Harry, say things like that!' Like thinking would make happen, I talk it, I would safe. I tried explain I reassured, made carry pan anyway. I young know statistically unlikely mugger target me, I old enough know not-thinking something stop happening, I really scared."  "Nothing else?" Professor McGonagall said pause, became clear Harry done. "There anything else happened you?"  "I know sound like much," Harry defended. "But one critical life moments, see? I mean, I knew thinking something stop happening, I knew that, I could see Mum really thought way." Harry stopped, struggling anger starting rise thought it. "She listen. I tried tell her, I begged send out, laughed off. Everything I said, treated like sort big joke..." Harry forced black rage back again. "That's I realised everyone supposed protect actually crazy, listen matter much I begged them, I ever rely get anything right." Sometimes good intentions enough, sometimes sane...  There long silence.  Harry took time breathe deeply calm down. There point getting angry. There point getting angry. All parents like that, adult would lower far enough place level ground child listen, genetic parents would different. Sanity tiny spark night, infinitesimally rare exception rule madness, point getting angry.  Harry like angry.  "Thank sharing that, Mr. Potter," said Professor McGonagall while. There abstracted look face (almost exactly look appeared Harry's face experimenting pouch, Harry seen mirror realise that). "I shall think this." She turned towards alley mouthway, raised wand -  "Um," Harry said, "can go get healer's kit now?"  The witch paused, looked back steadily. "And I say - expensive need - what?"  Harry's face twisted bitterness. "Exactly thinking, Professor McGonagall. Exactly thinking. I conclude another crazy adult I can't talk to, I start planning get hands healer's kit anyway."  "I guardian trip," Professor McGonagall said tinge danger. "I allow push around."  "I understand," Harry said. He kept resentment voice, say things came mind. Professor McGonagall told think spoke. He probably remember tomorrow, could least remember five minutes.  The witch's wand made slight circle hand, noises Diagon Alley came back. "All right, young man," said. "Let's go get healer's kit."  Harry's jaw dropped surprise. Then hurried her, almost stumbling sudden rush.   The shop left it, recognisable unrecognisable items still laid slanted wooden display, grey glow still protecting salesgirl back old position. The salesgirl looked approached, face showing surprise.  "I'm sorry," said got closer, Harry spoke almost moment, "I apologise -"  They broke looked other, salesgirl laughed little. "I mean get trouble Professor McGonagall," said. Her voice lowered conspiratorially. "I hope awful you."  "Della!" said Professor McGonagall, sounding scandalised.  "Bag gold," Harry said pouch, looked back salesgirl counted five Galleons. "Don't worry, I understand awful loves me."  He counted five Galleons salesgirl Professor McGonagall spluttering something unimportant. "One Emergency Healing Pack Plus, please."  It actually sort unnerving see Widening Lip swallowed briefcase-sized medical kit. Harry help wondering would happen tried climbing mokeskin pouch himself, given person put something supposed able take again.  When pouch done... eating... hard-won purchase, Harry swore heard small burping sound afterward. That spelled purpose. The alternative hypothesis horrifying contemplate... fact Harry even think alternative hypotheses. Harry looked back Professor, began walking Diagon Alley more. "Where next?"  Professor McGonagall pointed toward shop looked made flesh instead bricks covered fur instead paint. "Small pets permitted Hogwarts - could get owl send letters, example -"  "Can I pay Knut something rent owl I need send mail?"  "Yes," said Professor McGonagall.  "Then I think emphatically no."  Professor McGonagall nodded, though ticking point. "Might I ask not?"  "I pet rock once. It died."  "You think could take care pet?"  "I could," Harry said, "but I would end obsessing day long whether I'd remembered feed day slowly starving cage, wondering master food."  "That poor owl," older witch said soft voice. "Abandoned like that. I wonder would do."  "Well, I expect it'd get really hungry start trying claw way cage box whatever, though probably much luck -" Harry stopped short.  The witch went on, still soft voice. "And would happen afterward?"  "Excuse me," Harry said, reached take Professor McGonagall hand, gently firmly, steered yet another alleyway; ducking many well-wishers process become almost unnoticeably routine. "Please cast silencing spell."  "Quietus."  Harry's voice shaking. "That owl represent me, parents never locked cupboard left starve, I abandonment fears I like trend thoughts, Professor McGonagall!"  The witch looked gravely. "And thoughts would be, Mr. Potter?"  "You think I was," Harry trouble saying it, "I abused?"  "Were you?"  "No!" Harry shouted. "No, I never was! Do think I'm stupid? I know concept child abuse, I know inappropriate touching anything like happened I would call police! And report head teacher! And look social services phone book! And tell Grandpa Grandma Mrs. Figg! But parents never anything like that, never ever ever! How dare suggest thing!"  The older witch gazed steadily. "It duty Deputy Headmistress investigate possible signs abuse children care."  Harry's anger spiralling control pure, black fury. "Don't ever dare breathe word these, insinuations anyone else! No one, hear me, McGonagall? An accusation like ruin people destroy families even parents completely innocent! I've read newspapers!" Harry's voice climbing high-pitched scream. "The system know stop, believe parents children say nothing happened! Don't dare threaten family that! I let destroy home!"  "Harry," older witch said softly, reached hand towards -  Harry took fast step back, hand snapped knocked away.  McGonagall froze, pulled hand back, took step backwards. "Harry, right," said. "I believe you."  "Do you," Harry hissed. The fury still roaring blood. "Or waiting get away file papers?"  "Harry, I saw house. I saw parents. They love you. You love them. I believe say parents abusing you. But I ask, something strange work here."  Harry stared coldly. "Like what?"  "Harry, I've seen many abused children time Hogwarts, would break heart know many. And, happy, behave like one children, all. You smile strangers, hug people, I put hand shoulder flinch. But sometimes, sometimes, say something seems much like... someone spent first eleven years locked cellar. Not loving family I saw." Professor McGonagall tilted head, expression growing puzzled again.  Harry took in, processing it. The black rage began drain away, dawned listened respectfully, family danger.  "And explain observations, Professor McGonagall?"  "I know," said. "But possible something could happened remember."  Fury rose Harry. That sounded much like he'd read newspaper stories shattered families. "Suppressed memory load pseudoscience! People repress traumatic memories, remember well rest lives!"  "No, Mr. Potter. There Charm called Obliviation."  Harry froze place. "A spell erases memories?"  The older witch nodded. "But effects experience, see I'm saying, Mr. Potter."  A chill went Harry's spine. That hypothesis... could easily refuted. "But parents that!"  "Indeed not," said Professor McGonagall. "It would taken someone wizarding world. There's... way certain, I'm afraid."  Harry's rationalist skills began boot again. "Professor McGonagall, sure observations, alternative explanations could also be?"  The witch opened hands, though show emptiness. "Sure? I'm sure nothing, Mr. Potter. In life I've never met anyone else like you. Sometimes seem eleven years old even human."  Harry's eyebrows rose toward sky -  "I'm sorry!" Professor McGonagall said quickly. "I'm sorry, Mr. Potter. I trying make point I'm afraid came sounding different I mind -"  "On contrary, Professor McGonagall," Harry said, slowly smiled. "I shall take great compliment. But would mind I offered alternative explanation?"  "Please do."  "Children meant much smarter parents," Harry said. "Or much saner, maybe - father could probably outsmart was, know, actually trying, instead using adult intelligence mainly come new reasons change mind -" Harry stopped. "I'm smart, Professor. I've got nothing say normal children. Adults respect enough really talk me. And frankly, even did, sound smart Richard Feynman, I might well read something Richard Feynman wrote instead. I'm isolated, Professor McGonagall. I've isolated whole life. Maybe effects locked cellar. And I'm intelligent look parents way children designed do. My parents love me, feel obliged respond reason, sometimes I feel like they're children - children listen absolute authority whole existence. I try bitter it, I also try honest myself, so, yes, I'm bitter. And I also anger management problem, I'm working it. That's all."  "That's all?"  Harry nodded firmly. "That's all. Surely, Professor McGonagall, even magical Britain, normal explanation always worth considering?"   It later day, sun lowering summer sky shoppers beginning peter streets. Some shops already closed; Harry Professor McGonagall bought textbooks Flourish Blotts deadline. With slight explosion Harry made beeline keyword "Arithmancy" discovered seventh-year textbooks invoked nothing mathematically advanced trigonometry.  At moment, though, dreams low-hanging research fruit far Harry's mind.  At moment, two walking Ollivander's, Harry staring wand. He'd waved it, produced multicoloured sparks, really come extra shock everything else he'd seen, somehow -  I magic.  Me. As in, personally. I magical; I wizard.  He felt magic pouring arm, instant, realised always sense, possessed whole life, sense sight sound smell taste touch magic. Like eyes keeping always closed, even realise seeing darkness; one day eye opened, saw world. The shock poured him, touching pieces himself, awakening them, died away seconds; leaving certain knowledge wizard, always been, even, strange way, always known it.  And -  "It curious indeed destined wand brother why, brother gave scar."  That could possibly coincidence. There thousands wands shop. Well, okay, actually could coincidence, six billion people world thousand-to-one coincidences happened every day. But Bayes's Theorem said reasonable hypothesis made likely thousand-to-one he'd end brother Dark Lord's wand, going advantage.  Professor McGonagall simply said peculiar left that, put Harry state shock sheer, overwhelming uncuriosity wizards witches. In imaginable world would Harry went "Hm" walked shop without even trying come hypothesis going on.  His left hand rose touched scar.  What... exactly...  "You're full wizard now," said Professor McGonagall. "Congratulations."  Harry nodded.  "And think wizarding world?" said she.  "It's strange," Harry said. "I ought thinking everything I've seen magic... everything I know possible, everything I know lie, work left understand it. And yet I find distracted relative trivialities like," Harry lowered voice, "the whole Boy-Who-Lived thing." There seem anyone nearby, point tempting fate.  Professor McGonagall ahemmed. "Really? You say."  Harry nodded. "Yes. It's just... odd. To find part grand story, quest defeat great terrible Dark Lord, already done. Finished. Completely with. Like Frodo Baggins find parents took Mount Doom toss Ring one year old even remember it."  Professor McGonagall's smile grown somewhat fixed.  "You know, I anyone else, anyone else all, I'd probably pretty worried living start. Gosh, Harry, done since defeated Dark Lord? Your bookshop? That's great! Say, know I named child you? But I hopes prove problem." Harry sighed. "Still... almost enough make wish loose ends quest, I could say I really, know, participated somehow."  "Oh?" said Professor McGonagall odd tone. "What mind?"  "Well, example, mentioned parents betrayed. Who betrayed them?"  "Sirius Black," witch said, almost hissing name. "He's Azkaban. Wizarding prison."  "How probable Sirius Black break prison I'll track defeat sort spectacular duel, better yet put large bounty head hide Australia I wait results?"  Professor McGonagall blinked. Twice. "Not likely. No one ever escaped Azkaban, I doubt first."  Harry bit sceptical "no one ever escaped Azkaban" line. Still, maybe magic could actually get close 100% perfect prison, especially wand not. The best way get would go first place.  "All right then," Harry said. "Sounds like nicely wrapped up." He sighed, scrubbing palm head. "Or maybe Dark Lord really die night. Not completely. His spirit lingers, whispering people nightmares bleed waking world, searching way back living lands swore destroy, now, accordance ancient prophecy, I locked deadly duel winner shall lose loser shall win -"  Professor McGonagall's head swivelled, eyes darted around, though search street listeners.  "I'm joking, Professor," Harry said annoyance. Sheesh, always take everything seriously -  A slow sinking sensation began dawn pit Harry's stomach.  Professor McGonagall looked Harry calm expression. A very, calm expression. Then smile put on. "Of course are, Mr. Potter."  Aw crap.  If Harry needed formalise wordless inference flashed mind, would come something like, 'If I estimate probability Professor McGonagall I saw result carefully controlling herself, versus probability distribution things would naturally I made bad joke, behavior significant evidence hiding something.'  But Harry actually thought was, Aw crap.  Harry turned head scan street. Nope, one nearby. "He's dead, he," Harry sighed.  "Mr. Potter -"  "The Dark Lord alive. Of course he's alive. It act utter optimism even dreamed otherwise. I must taken leave senses, I can't imagine I thinking. Just someone said body found burned crisp, I can't imagine I would thought dead.Clearly I much left learn art proper pessimism."  "Mr. Potter -"  "At least tell there's really prophecy..." Professor McGonagall still giving bright, fixed smile. "Oh, got kidding me."  "Mr. Potter, go inventing things worry -"  "Are actually going tell that? Imagine reaction later, I find something worry all."  Her fixed smile faltered.  Harry's shoulders slumped. "I whole world magic analyse. I time this."  Then shut up, man flowing orange robes appeared street slowly passed by; Professor McGonagall's eyes tracked him, unobtrusively. Harry's mouth moving chewed hard lip, someone watching closely would noticed tiny spot blood appear.  When orange-robed man passed distance, Harry spoke again, low murmur. "Are going tell truth now, Professor McGonagall? And bother trying wave off, I'm stupid."  "You're eleven years old, Mr. Potter!" said harsh whisper.  "And therefore subhuman. Sorry... moment there, I forgot."  "These dreadful important matters! They secret, Mr. Potter! It catastrophe you, still child, know even much! You must tell anyone, understand? Absolutely one!"  As sometimes happened Harry got sufficiently angry, blood went cold, instead hot, terrible dark clarity descended mind, mapping possible tactics assessing consequences iron realism.  Point right know: Failure. Eleven-year-old children rights know anything, McGonagall's eyes.  Say friends more: Failure. She value friendship sufficiently.  Point danger know: Failure. Plans already made based ignorance. The certain inconvenience rethinking seem far unpalatable mere uncertain prospect coming harm.  Justice reason fail. You must either find something wants, find something fears...  Ah.  "Well then, Professor," Harry said low, icy tone, "it sounds like I something want. You can, like, tell truth, whole truth, return I keep secrets. Or try keep ignorant use pawn, case I owe nothing."  McGonagall stopped short street. Her eyes blazed voice descended outright hiss. "How dare you!"  "How dare you!" whispered back her.  "You would blackmail me?"  Harry's lips twisted. "I offering favor. I giving chance protect precious secret. If refuse I every natural motive make inquiries elsewhere, spite you, I know! Get past pointless anger child think ought obey you, realise sane adult would same! Look perspective! How would feel YOU?"  Harry watched McGonagall, observed harsh breathing. It occurred time ease pressure, let simmer while. "You decide right away," Harry said normal tone. "I'll understand want time think offer... I'll warn one thing," Harry said, voice going colder. "Don't try Obliviation spell me. Some time ago I worked signal, I already sent signal myself. If I find signal I remember sending it..." Harry let voice trail significantly.  McGonagall's face working expressions shifted. "I... thinking Obliviating you, Mr. Potter... would invented signal know -"  "I thought reading Muggle science-fiction book, said myself, well, case... And no, I tell signal, I'm dumb."  "I planned ask," McGonagall said. She seemed fold herself, suddenly looked old, tired. "This exhausting day, Mr. Potter. Can get trunk, send home? I trust speak upon matter I time think. Keep mind two people whole world know matter, Headmaster Albus Dumbledore Professor Severus Snape."  So. New information; peace offering. Harry nodded acceptance, turned head look forward, started walking again, blood slowly began warm more.  "So I've got find way kill immortal Dark Wizard," Harry said, sighed frustration. "I really wish told I started shopping."   The trunk shop richly appointed shop Harry visited; curtains lush delicately patterned, floor walls stained polished wood, trunks occupied places honor polished ivory platforms. The salesman dressed robes finery cut Lucius Malfoy, spoke exquisite, oily politeness Harry Professor McGonagall.  Harry asked questions, gravitated trunk heavy-looking wood, polished warm solid, carved pattern guardian dragon whose eyes shifted look anyone nearing it. A trunk charmed light, shrink command, sprout small clawed tentacles bottom squirm owner. A trunk two drawers four sides slid reveal compartments deep whole trunk. A lid four locks would reveal different space inside. And - important part - handle bottom slid frame containing staircase leading small, lighted room would hold, Harry estimated, around twelve bookcases.  If made luggages like this, Harry know anyone bothered owning house.  One hundred eight golden Galleons. That price good trunk, lightly used. At around fifty British pounds Galleon, enough buy second-hand car. It would expensive everything else Harry ever bought whole life put together.  Ninety-seven Galleons. That much left bag gold Harry allowed take Gringotts.  Professor McGonagall wore look chagrin upon face. After long day's shopping needed ask Harry much gold left bag, salesman quoted price, meant Professor could good mental arithmetic without pen paper. Once again, Harry reminded scientifically illiterate thing stupid.  "I'm sorry, young man," said Professor McGonagall. "This entirely fault. I would offer take back Gringotts, bank closed emergency services now."  Harry looked her, wondering...  "Well," sighed Professor McGonagall, swung one heel, "we may well go, I suppose."  ...she lost completely child dared defy her. She happy, thought instead exploding fury. It might immortal Dark Lord fight - needed Harry's goodwill. But adults capable thinking even much; consider future consequences all, someone lower status refused obey them...     "Professor?" Harry said.  The witch turned back looked him.  Harry took deep breath. He needed little angry wanted try now, way he'd courage otherwise. She listen me, thought himself, I would taken gold want listen... Focusing entire world McGonagall need bend conversation will, spoke.  "Professor, thought one hundred Galleons would enough trunk. That's bother warning went ninety-seven. Which sort thing research studies show - that's happens people think they're leaving little error margin. They're pessimistic enough. If it'd me, I'd taken two hundred Galleons sure. There plenty money vault, I could put back extra later. But I thought let it. I thought angry asking. Was I wrong?"  "I suppose I must confess right," said Professor McGonagall. "But, young man -"  "That sort thing reason I trouble trusting adults." Somehow Harry kept voice steady. "Because get angry even try reason them. To defiance insolence challenge higher tribal status. If try talk get angry. So I anything really important do, I able trust you. Even listened deep concern whatever I said - that's also part role someone playing concerned adult - never change actions, actually behave differently, anything I said."  The salesman watching unabashed fascination.  "I understand point view," Professor McGonagall said eventually. "If I sometimes seem strict, please remember I served Head Gryffindor House feels like several thousand years."  Harry nodded continued. "So - suppose I way get Galleons vault without us going back Gringotts, involved violating role obedient child. Would I able trust that, even though step outside role Professor McGonagall take advantage it?"  "What?" said Professor McGonagall.  "To put another way, I could make today happened differently, take little money us, would right even though would involve child insolent adult retrospect?"  "I... suppose..." witch said, looking quite puzzled.  Harry took mokeskin pouch, said, "Eleven Galleons originally family vault."  And gold Harry's hand.  For moment Professor McGonagall's mouth gaped wide, jaw snapped shut eyes narrowed witch bit out, "Where get -"  "From family vault, like I said."  "How?"  "Magic."  "That's hardly answer!" snapped Professor McGonagall, stopped, blinking.  "No, isn't, it? I ought claim I experimentally discovered true secrets pouch works actually retrieve objects anywhere, inside, phrase request correctly. But actually I fell pile gold I shoved Galleons pocket. Anyone understands pessimism knows money something might need quickly without much warning. So angry defying authority? Or glad succeeded important mission?"  The salesman's eyes wide like saucers.  And tall witch stood there, silent.  "Discipline Hogwarts must enforced," said almost full minute. "For sake students. And must include courtesy obedience professors."  "I understand, Professor McGonagall."  "Good. Now let us buy trunk go home."  Harry felt like throwing up, cheering, fainting, something. That first time careful reasoning ever worked anyone. Maybe also first time something really serious adult needed him, still -  Minerva McGonagall, +1 point.  Harry bowed, gave bag gold extra eleven Galleons McGonagall's hands. "Thank much, Professor. Can finish purchase me? I've got visit lavatory."  The salesman, unctuous more, pointed toward door set wall gold-handled knob. As Harry started walk away, heard salesman ask oily voice, "May I inquire was, Madam McGonagall? I take Slytherin - third-year, perhaps? - prominent family, I recognise -"  The slam lavatory door cut words, Harry identified lock pressed place, grabbed magical self-cleaning towel and, shaky hands, wiped moisture forehead. Harry's entire body sheathed sweat soaked clear Muggle clothing, though least show robes.   The sun setting late indeed, time stood courtyard Leaky Cauldron, silent leaf-dusted interface magical Britain's Diagon Alley entire Muggle world. (That one awfully decoupled economy...) Harry go phone box call father, side. He need worry luggage stolen, apparently. His trunk status major magical item, something Muggles notice; part could get wizarding world, willing pay price secondhand car.  "So part ways, time," Professor McGonagall said. She shook head wonderment. "This strangest day life for... many year. Since day I learned child defeated You-Know-Who. I wonder now, looking back, last reasonable day world."  Oh, like anything complain about. You think day surreal? Try mine.  "I impressed today," Harry said her. "I remembered compliment loud, I awarding points head everything."  "Thank you, Mr. Potter," said Professor McGonagall. "If already sorted House I would deducted many points grandchildren would still losing House Cup."  "Thank you, Professor." It probably early call Minnie.  This woman might well sanest adult Harry ever met, despite lack scientific background. Harry even considering offering number-two position whatever group formed fight Dark Lord, though silly enough say loud. Now would good name that...? The Death Eater Eaters?  "I'll see soon, school starts," Professor McGonagall said. "And, Mr. Potter, wand -"  "I know going ask," Harry said. He took precious wand and, deep twinge inner pain, flipped hand, presenting handle. "Take it. I planned anything, single thing, I want nightmares blowing house."  Professor McGonagall shook head rapidly. "Oh no, Mr. Potter! That done. I meant warn use wand home, since Ministry detect underage magic prohibited without supervision."  "Ah," Harry said. "That sounds like sensible rule. I'm glad see wizarding world takes sort thing seriously."  Professor McGonagall peered hard him. "You really mean that."  "Yes," Harry said. "I get it. Magic dangerous rules good reasons. Certain matters also dangerous. I get too. Remember I stupid."  "I unlikely ever forget it. Thank you, Harry, make feel better entrusting certain things. Goodbye now."  Harry turned go, Leaky Cauldron towards Muggle world.  As hand touched back door's handle, heard last whisper behind him.  "Hermione Granger."  "What?" Harry said, hand still door.  "Look first-year girl named Hermione Granger train Hogwarts."  "Who she?"  There answer, Harry turned around, Professor McGonagall gone.   Aftermath:  Headmaster Albus Dumbledore leaned forward desk. His twinkling eyes peered Minerva. "So, dear, find Harry?"  Minerva opened mouth. Then closed mouth. Then opened mouth again. No words came out.  "I see," Albus said gravely. "Thank report, Minerva. You may go."   Chapter 7: Reciprocation  Whoa. A spokesman Rowling's literary agent said Rowling okay existence fanfiction long one charges everyone's clear original copyrights belong her? That's really cool her. So thank you, JKR, thine kingdom!   I feel need disclaim certain parts chapter meant "bashing". It's I grudge, story writes start dropping anvils character hard stop.  A reviewers asked whether science story real made up. Yes, real, look profile, see link certain nonfiction site teach pretty much everything Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres knows some.  Thank much reviewers. (Especially Darkandus Viridian Dreams, surprisingly inspiring comment "Lungs tea meant interact".   "Your dad almost awesome dad."   Petunia Evans-Verres's lips trembling eyes tearing Harry hugged midsection Platform Nine King's Cross Station. "Are sure want come you, Harry?"  Harry glanced father Michael Verres-Evans, looking stereotypically stern-but-proud, back mother, really look rather... uncomposed. "Mum, I know like wizarding world much. You come with. I mean it."  Petunia winced. "Harry, worry me, I'm mother need someone -"  "Mum, I'm going Hogwarts months months. If I can't manage train platform alone, better find sooner rather later abort." He lowered voice whisper. "Besides, Mum, love there. If I problems, I need take sweatband," Harry tapped exercise band covering scar, "and I'll way help I handle."  "Oh, Harry," Petunia whispered. She knelt hugged hard, face face, cheeks resting other. Harry could feel ragged breathing, heard muffled sob escape. "Oh, Harry, I love you, always remember that."  It's like afraid she'll never see again, thought popped Harry's head. He knew thought true know Mum afraid.  So made guess. "Mum, know I'm going turn sister I'm learning magic, right? I'll magic ask - I can, I mean - want use magic around house, I'll too, I promise I'll never let magic come us -"  A tight hug cut words. "You good heart," mother whispered ear. "A good heart, son."  Harry choked little, then.  His mother released him, stood up. She took handkerchief handbag, trembling hand dabbed running makeup around eyes.  There questions father accompanying magical side King's Cross Station. Dad trouble looking Harry's trunk directly. Magic ran families, Michael Verres-Evans even walk.  So instead father cleared throat. "Good luck school, Harry," said. "Do think I bought enough books?"  Harry explained father thought might big chance something really revolutionary important, Professor Verres-Evans nodded dumped extremely busy schedule two solid days order go Greatest Secondhand Bookshop Raid Ever, covered four cities produced thirty boxes science books sitting cavern level Harry's trunk. Most books gone pound two, definitely hadn't, like latest Handbook Chemistry Physics complete 1972 set Encyclopaedia Britannica. His father tried block Harry seeing till displays Harry figured father must spent least thousand pounds. Harry said father would pay back soon figured convert wizarding gold Muggle money, father told go jump lake.  And father asked him: Do think I bought enough books? It quite clear answer Dad wanted hear.  Harry's throat hoarse, reason. "You never enough books," recited Verres family motto, father knelt gave quick, firm embrace. "But certainly tried," Harry said, felt choking again. "It really, really, really good try."  His Dad straightened. "So..." said. "Do see Platform Nine Three-Quarters?"  King's Cross Station huge busy, walls floors paved ordinary dirt-stained tiles. It full ordinary people hurrying ordinary business, ordinary conversations generated lots lots ordinary noise. King's Cross Station Platform Nine (which standing on) Platform Ten (right nearby) nothing Platform Nine Platform Ten except thin, unpromising barrier wall. A great skylight overhead let plenty light illuminate total lack whatsoever Platform Nine Three-Quarters.  Harry stared around eyes watered, thinking, come on, mage-sight, come on, mage-sight, absolutely nothing appeared him. He thought taking wand waving it, Professor McGonagall warned using wand. Plus another shower multicoloured sparks might lead arrested setting fireworks inside train station. And assuming wand decide something else, like blowing King's Cross. Harry lightly skimmed schoolbooks (though skim quite bizarre enough) quick effort determine sort science books buy next 48 hours.  Well, - Harry glanced watch - one whole hour figure out, since supposed train eleven. Maybe equivalent IQ test stupid kids become wizards. (And amount extra time gave would determine Conscientiousness, second important factor scholarly success.)  "I'll figure out," Harry said waiting parents. "It's probably sort test thingy."  His father frowned. "Hm... maybe look trail mixed footprints ground, leading somewhere seem make sense -"  "Dad!" Harry said. "Stop that! I even tried figure own!" It good suggestion, too, worse.  "Sorry," father apologised.  "Ah..." Harry's mother said. "I think would student, you? Are sure Professor McGonagall tell anything?"  "Maybe distracted," Harry said without thinking.  "Harry!" hissed father mother unison. "What do?"  "I, um -" Harry swallowed. "Look, time -"  "Harry!"  "I mean it! We time now! Because really long story I've got figure get school!"  His mother hand face. "How bad it?"  "I, ah," I can't talk reasons National Security, "about half bad Incident Science Project?"  "Harry!"  "I, er, oh look people owl I'll go ask get in!" Harry ran away parents towards family fiery redheads, trunk automatically slithering behind him.  The plump woman looked arrived. "Hello, dear. First time Hogwarts? Ron's new, -" peered closely him. "Harry Potter?"  Four boys red-headed girl owl swung around froze place.  "Oh, come on!" Harry protested. He'd planning go Harry Verres least got Hogwarts. "I bought sweatband everything! How come know I am?"  "Yes," Harry's father said, coming behind long easy strides, "how know is?" His voice indicated certain dread.  "Your picture newspapers," said one two identical-looking twins.  "HARRY!"  "Dad! It's like that! It's 'cause I defeated Dark Lord You-Know-Who I one year old!"  "WHAT?"  "Mum explain."  "WHAT?"  "Ah... Michael dear, certain things I thought would best bother -"  "Excuse me," Harry said redheaded family staring him, "but would quite extremely helpful could tell get Platform Nine Three Quarters right now."  "Ah..." said woman. She raised hand pointed wall platforms. "Just walk straight barrier platforms nine ten. Don't stop scared crash it, that's important. Best bit run nervous."  "And whatever do, think elephant."  "George! Ignore him, Harry dear, there's reason think elephant."  "I'm Fred, Mum, George -"  "Thanks!" Harry said took run towards barrier -  Wait minute, work unless believed it?  It times like Harry hated mind actually working fast enough realise case "resonant doubt" applied, is, he'd started thinking would go barrier he'd fine, worried whether sufficiently believed he'd go barrier, meant actually worried crashing -  "Harry! Get back here, explaining do!" That Dad.  Harry shut eyes ignored everything knew justified credibility tried believe really hard he'd go barrier -  - sounds around changed.  Harry opened eyes stumbled halt, feeling vaguely dirtied made deliberate effort believe something.  He standing bright, open-air platform next single huge train, fourteen long carriages headed massive scarlet-metal steam engine tall chimney promised death air quality. The platform already lightly crowded (even though Harry full hour early); dozens children parents swarmed around benches, tables, various hawkers stalls.  It went entirely without saying place King's Cross Station room hide it.  Okay, either (a) I teleported somewhere else entirely (b) fold space like one's business (c) simply ignoring rules.  There slithering sound behind him, Harry turned around observe trunk indeed followed small clawed tentacles. Apparently, magical purposes, luggage also managed believe sufficient strength pass barrier. That actually little disturbing Harry started thinking it.  A moment later, youngest-looking red-haired boy came iron archway (iron archway?) run, pulling trunk behind lead nearly crashing Harry. Harry, feeling stupid stayed around, quickly began moving away landing area, red-haired boy followed him, yanking hard trunk's lead order keep up. A moment later, white owl fluttered archway came rest boy's shoulder.  "Cor," said red-haired boy, "are really Harry Potter?"  Not again. "I logical way knowing certain. My parents raised believe name Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, many people told I look like parents, I mean parents, but," Harry frowned, realising, "for I know, could easily spells polymorph child specified appearance -"  "Er, what, mate?"  Not headed Ravenclaw, I take it. "Yes, I'm Harry Potter."  "I'm Ron Weasley," said tall skinny freckled long-nosed kid, stuck hand, Harry politely shook walked. The owl gave Harry oddly measured courteous hoot (actually eehhhhh sound, surprised Harry).  At point Harry realised potential imminent catastrophe. "Just second," said Ron, opened one drawers trunk, one recalled correctly Winter Clothes - - found lightest scarf owned, underneath winter coat. Harry took sweatband, quickly unfolded scarf tied around face. It little hot, especially summer, Harry could live that.  Then shut drawer pulled another drawer drew forth black wizarding robes, shrugged head, Muggle territory.  "There," Harry said. The sound came slightly muffled scarf face. He turned Ron. "How I look? Stupid, I know, I identifiable Harry Potter?"  "Er," Ron said. He closed mouth, open. "Not really, Harry."  "Very good," Harry said. "However, obviate point whole exercise, henceforth address as," Verres might work anymore, "Mr. Spoo."  "Okay, Harry," Ron said uncertainly.  The Force particularly strong one. "Call... me... Mister... Spoo."  "Okay, Mister Spoo -" Ron stopped. "I can't that, makes feel stupid."  That's feeling. "Okay. You pick name."  "Mr. Cannon," Ron said once. "For Chudley Cannons."  "Ah..." Harry knew going terribly regret asking this. "Who Chudley Cannons?"  "Who're Chudley Cannons? Only brilliant team whole history Quidditch! Sure, finished bottom league last year, -"  "What's Quidditch?"  Asking also mistake.  "So let get straight," Harry said seemed Ron's explanation (with associated hand gestures) winding down. "Catching Snitch worth one hundred fifty points?"  "Yeah -"  "How many ten-point goals one side usually score counting Snitch?"  "Um, maybe fifteen twenty professional games -"  "That's wrong. That violates every possible rule game design. Look, rest game sounds like might make sense, sort of, sport I mean, basically saying catching Snitch overwhelms almost ordinary point spread. The two Seekers flying around looking Snitch usually interacting anyone else, spotting Snitch first going mostly luck -"  "It's luck!" protested Ron. "You've got keep eyes moving right pattern -"  "That's interactive, there's back-and-forth player much fun watch someone incredibly good moving eyes? And whichever Seeker gets lucky swoops grabs Snitch makes everyone else's work moot. It's like someone took real game grafted pointless extra position could Most Important Player without needing really get involved learn rest it. Who first Seeker, King's idiot son wanted play Quidditch understand rules?" Actually, Harry thought it, seemed like surprisingly good hypothesis. Put broomstick tell catch shiny thing...  Ron's face pulled scowl. "If like Quidditch, make fun it!"  "If can't criticise, can't optimise. I'm suggesting improve game. And simple. Get rid Snitch."  "They change game 'cause say so!"  "I Boy-Who-Lived, know. People listen me. And maybe I persuade change game Hogwarts, innovation spread."  A look absolute horror spreading Ron's face. "But, get rid Snitch, anyone know game ends?"  "Buy... a... clock. It would lot fairer game sometimes end ten minutes sometimes end hours, schedule would lot predictable spectators, too." Harry sighed. "Oh, stop giving look absolute horror, I probably actually take time destroy pathetic excuse national sport remake stronger smarter image. I've got way, way, way important stuff worry about." Harry looked thoughtful. "Then again, take much time write Ninety-Five Theses Snitchless Reformation nail church door -"  "Potter," drawled young boy's voice, "what face standing next you?"  Ron's look horror replaced utter hatred. "You!"  Harry turned head; indeed Draco Malfoy, might forced wear standard school robes, making trunk looking least magical far elegant Harry's own, decorated silver emeralds bearing Harry guessed Malfoy family crest, beautiful fanged serpent crossed ivory wands.  "Draco!" Harry said. "Er, Malfoy prefer, though kind sounds like Lucius me. I'm glad see well after, um, last meeting. This Ron Weasley. And I'm trying go incognito, call me, eh," Harry looked robes, "Mister Black."  "Harry!" hissed Ron. "You can't use name!"  Harry blinked. "Why not?" It sounded nicely dark, like international man mystery -  "I'd say fine name," said Draco, "but belongs Noble Most Ancient House Black. I'll call Mr. Silver."  "You get away from... Mr. Gold," Ron said coldly, took forward step. "He need talk likes you!"  Harry raised placating hand. "I'll go Mr. Bronze, thanks naming schema. And, Ron, um," Harry struggled find way say this, "I'm glad so... enthusiastic protecting me, I particularly mind talking Draco -"  This apparently last straw Ron, spun Harry eyes aflame outrage. "What? Do know is?"  "Yes, Ron," Harry said, "you may remember I called Draco without needing introduce himself."  Draco sniggered. Then eyes lit white owl Ron's shoulder. "Oh, what's this?" Draco said drawl rich malice. "Where's famous Weasley family rat?"  "Buried backyard," Ron said coldly.  "Aw, sad. Pot... ah, Mr. Bronze, I mention Weasley family widely agreed best pet story ever. Want tell it, Weasley?"  Ron's face contorted. "You think funny happened family!"  "Oh," Draco purred, "but ever happen Malfoys."  Ron's hands clenched fists -  "That's enough," Harry said, putting much quiet authority voice could manage. It clear whatever about, painful memory red-haired kid. "If Ron want talk it, talk it, I'd ask talk either."  Draco turned surprised look Harry, Ron nodded. "That's right, Harry! I mean Mr. Bronze! You see kind person is? Now tell go away!"  Harry counted ten inside head, quick 12345678910 - odd habit left age five mother first instructed it, Harry reasoned way faster ought effective. "I'm telling go away," Harry said calmly. "He's welcome talk wants."  "Well, I intend hang around anyone hangs around Draco Malfoy," Ron announced coldly.  Harry shrugged. "That's you. I intend let anyone say I can't hang around with." Silently chanting, please go away, please go away...  Ron's face went blank surprise, like he'd actually expected line work. Then Ron spun about, yanked luggage's lead stormed platform.  "If like him," Draco said curiously, "why walk away?"  "Um... mother helped figure get platform King's Cross Station, kind hard tell get lost. And I hate Ron guy," Harry said, "I just, just..." Harry searched words.  "Don't see reason exist?" offered Draco.  "Pretty much."  "Anyway, Potter... really raised Muggles -" Draco paused here, waiting denial, Harry say anything "- know like famous. People want take time. You learn say no."  Harry nodded, putting thoughtful look face. "That sounds like good advice."  "If try nice, end spending time pushiest ones. Decide want spend time make everyone else leave. You're getting here, Potter, everyone's going judge see with, want seen likes Ron Weasley."  Harry nodded again. "If mind asking, recognise me?"  "Mister Bronze," Draco drawled, "I met you, remember. I saw someone going around scarf wrapped around head, looking absolutely ridiculous. So I took guess."  Harry bowed head, accepting compliment. "I'm terribly sorry that," Harry said. "Our first meeting, I mean. I mean embarrass front Lucius."  Draco waved giving Harry odd look. "I wish Father could come flattering -" Draco laughed. "But thank said Father. If that, I might've harder time explaining."  Harry swept deeper bow. "And thank reciprocating said Professor McGonagall."  "You're welcome. Though one assistants must've sworn closest friend absolute secrecy, Father says there're weird rumors going around, like I got fight something."  "Ouch," Harry said, wincing. "I'm really sorry -"  "No, we're used it, Merlin knows there's lots rumors Malfoy family already."  Harry nodded. "I'm glad hear trouble."  Draco smirked. "Father has, um, refined sense humor, understand making friends. He understands well. He made repeat I went bed every night last month, 'I make friends Hogwarts.' When I explained everything saw that's I doing, bought ice-cream."  Harry's jaw dropped. "You managed spin ice-cream?"  Draco nodded, looking every bit smug feat deserved. "Well, father knew I doing, course, he's one taught it, I grin right way I'm it, makes father-son thing buy ice-cream I'll give sort sad look, like I think I must disappointed him."  Harry eyed Draco calculatingly, sensing presence another master. "You've lessons manipulate people?"  "Of course," Draco said proudly. "I'm Malfoy. Father bought tutors."  "Wow," Harry said. Reading Robert Cialdini's Influence: Science Practice probably stack high compared (though still one heck book). "Your dad almost awesome dad."  Draco's eyebrows rose loftily. "Oh? And father do?"  "He buys books."  Draco considered this. "That sound impressive."  "You there. Anyway, I'm glad hear that. The way Lucius looking you, I thought going c-crucify you."  "My father really loves me," Draco said firmly. "He ever that."  "Um..." Harry said. He remembered black-robed, white-haired figure elegance stormed Madam Malkin's, wielding beautiful, deadly silver-handled cane. It easy visualise doting father. "Don't take wrong way, know that?"  "Huh?" It clear question Draco commonly ask himself.  "I ask fundamental question rationality: Why believe believe? What think know think know it? What makes think Lucius sacrifice way he'd sacrifice anything else power?"  Draco shot Harry another odd look. "Just know Father?"  "Um... seat Wizengamot, seat Hogwarts' Board Governors, incredibly wealthy, ear Minister Fudge, confidence Minister Fudge, probably highly embarrassing photos Minister Fudge, prominent blood purist Dark Lord's gone, former Death Eater found Dark Mark got claiming Imperius Curse, ridiculously implausible pretty much everyone knew it... evil capital 'E' born killer... I think that's it."  Draco's eyes narrowed slits. "McGonagall told that, she."  "No, say anything Lucius afterwards, except stay away him. So Incident Potions Shop, Professor McGonagall busy yelling shopkeeper trying get everything control, I grabbed one customers asked Lucius."  Draco's eyes wide again. "Did really?"  Harry gave Draco puzzled look. "If I lied first time, I'm going tell truth ask twice."  There certain pause Draco absorbed this.  "You're completely going Slytherin."  "I'm completely going Ravenclaw, thank much. I want power I get books."  Draco giggled. "Yeah, right. Anyway... answer asked..." Draco took deep breath, face turned serious. "Father missed Wizengamot vote me. I broom I fell broke lot ribs. It really hurt. I'd never hurt much I thought I going die. So Father missed really important vote, bed St. Mungo's, holding hands promising I going okay."  Harry glanced away uncomfortably, then, effort, forced look back Draco. "Why telling that? It seems sort of... private..."  Draco gave Harry serious look. "One tutors said people form close friendships knowing private things other, reason people make close friends they're embarrassed share anything really important themselves." Draco turned palms invitingly. "Your turn?"  Knowing Draco's hopeful face probably drilled months practice make less effective, Harry observed. Actually make less effective, unfortunately ineffective. The could said Draco's clever use reciprocation pressure unsolicited gift, technique Harry read social psychology books (one experiment shown unconditional gift $5 twice effective conditional offer $50 getting people fill surveys). Draco made unsolicited gift confidence, invited Harry offer confidence return... thing was, Harry feel pressured. Refusal, Harry certain, would met look sad disappointment, maybe small amount contempt indicating Harry lost points.  "Draco," Harry said, "just know, I recognise exactly right now. My books called reciprocation talk giving someone straight gift two Sickles found twice effective offering twenty Sickles getting want..." Harry trailed off.  Draco looking sad disappointed. "It's meant trick, Harry. It's real way becoming friends."  Harry held hand. "I say I going respond. I need time pick something that's private non-damaging. Let's say... I wanted know I can't rushed things." A pause reflect could go long way defusing power lot compliance techniques, learned recognise were.  "All right," Draco said. "I'll wait come something. Oh, please take scarf say it."  Simple effective.  And Harry help notice clumsy, awkward, graceless attempt resisting manipulation / saving face / showing appeared compared Draco. I need tutors.  "All right," Harry said time. "Here's mine." He glanced around rolled scarf back face, exposing everything scar. "Um... sounds like really rely father. I mean... talk seriously, he'll always listen take seriously."  Draco nodded.  "Sometimes," Harry said, swallowed. This surprisingly hard, meant be. "Sometimes I wish Dad like yours." Harry's eyes flinched away Draco's face, less automatically, Harry forced look back Draco.  Then hit Harry Earth he'd said, Harry hastily added, "Not I wish Dad flawless instrument death like Lucius, I mean taking seriously -"  "I understand," Draco said smile. "There... feel like we're little closer friends?"  Harry nodded. "Yeah. It does, actually. Um... offence, I'm going put disguise again, I really want deal -"  "I understand."  Harry rolled scarf back face.  "My father takes friends seriously," Draco said. "That's lots friends. You meet him."  "I'll think it," Harry said neutral voice. He shook head wonder. "So really one weak point. Huh."  Now Draco giving Harry really odd look. "You want go get something drink find somewhere sit down?"  Harry realised standing one place long, stretched himself, trying crick back. "Sure."  The platform starting fill now, still quieter area far side away red steam engine. Along way passed stall containing bald, bearded man offering newspapers comic books stacked neon-green cans.  The stallholder was, fact, leaning back drinking one neon-green cans exact point spotted refined elegant Draco Malfoy approaching along mysterious boy looking incredibly stupid scarf tied face, causing stallholder experience sudden coughing fit mid-drink dribble large amount neon-green liquid onto beard.  "'Scuse me," Harry said, "but stuff, exactly?"  "Comed-Tea," said stallholder. "If drink it, something surprising bound happen makes spill someone else. But charmed vanish seconds later -" Indeed stain beard already disappearing.  "How droll," said Draco. "How very, droll. Come, Mr. Bronze, let's go find another -"  "Hold on," Harry said.  "Oh come on! That's just, juvenile!"  "No, I'm sorry Draco, I investigate this. What happens I drink Comed-Tea best keep conversation completely serious?"  The stallholder smiled mysteriously. "Who knows? A friend walks frog costume? Something unexpected bound happen -"  "No. I'm sorry. I believe it. That violates much-abused suspension disbelief many levels I even language describe it. There is, way bloody drink manipulate reality produce comedy setups, I'm going give retire Bahamas -"  Draco groaned. "Are really going this?"  "You drink I investigate. Have to. How much?"  "Five Knuts can," stallholder said.  "Five Knuts? You sell reality-manipulating fizzy drinks five Knuts can?" Harry reached pouch, said "four Sickles, four Knuts", slapped counter. "Two dozen cans please."  "I'll also take one," Draco sighed, started reach pockets.  Harry shook head rapidly. "No, I've got this, count favor either, I want see works too." He took stack placed counter tossed Draco, started feeding pouch. The pouch's Widening Lip ate cans accompanied small burping noises, exactly helping restore Harry's faith would someday discover reasonable explanation this.  Twenty-two burps later, Harry last purchased hand, Draco looking expectantly, two pulled ring time.  Harry rolled scarf expose mouth, tilted heads back drank Comed-Tea.  It somehow tasted bright green - extra-fizzy limer lime.  Aside that, nothing else happened.  Harry looked stallholder, watching benevolently.  All right, guy took advantage natural accident sell twenty-four cans nothing, I'm going applaud creative entrepreneurial spirit kill him.  "It always happen immediately," stallholder said. "But guaranteed happen per can, money back."  Harry took another long drink.  Once again, nothing happened.  Maybe I chug whole thing fast possible... hope stomach explode carbon dioxide, I burp drinking it...  No, could afford little patient. But honestly, Harry see going work. You go someone say "Now I'm going surprise you" "And I'm going tell punchline joke, it'll really funny." It ruined shock value. In Harry's state mental preparedness, Lucius Malfoy could walked past ballerina outfit made proper spit-take. Just sort wacky shenanigan universe supposed cough now?  "Anyway, let's sit down," Harry said. He prepared swig another drink started towards distant seating area, put right angle glance back see portion stall's newspaper stand devoted newspaper called The Quibbler, showing following headline:  BOY-WHO-LIVED GETS   DRACO MALFOY PREGNANT  "Gah!" screamed Draco bright green liquid sprayed Harry's direction. Draco turned Harry fire eyes grabbed can. "You son mudblood! Let's see like spat upon!" Draco took deliberate swig eyes caught sight headline.  In sheer reflex action, Harry tried block face spray liquid flew direction. Unfortunately blocked using hand containing Comed-Tea, sending rest green liquid splash shoulder.  Harry stared hand even went choking spluttering green colour started vanish Draco's robes.  Then looked stared newspaper headline.  BOY-WHO-LIVED GETS   DRACO MALFOY PREGNANT  Harry's lips opened said, "buh-bluh-buh-buh..."  Too many competing objections, problem. Every time Harry tried say "But we're eleven!" objection "But men can't get pregnant!" demanded first priority run "But there's nothing us, really!"  Then Harry looked hand again.  He feeling deep-seated desire run away screaming top lungs dropped lack oxygen, thing stopping read outright panic sign truly important scientific problem.  Harry snarled, threw violently nearby rubbish bin, stalked back stall. "One copy The Quibbler, please." Harry paid four Knuts, retrieved another Comed-Tea pouch, stalked picnic area blond-haired boy, staring expression frank admiration.  "I take back," Draco said, "that pretty good."  "Hey, Draco, know I bet even better becoming friends exchanging secrets? Committing murder."  "I tutor says that," Draco allowed. He reached inside robes scratched easy, natural motion. "Who've got mind?"  Harry slammed The Quibbler hard picnic table. "The guy came headline."  Draco groaned. "Not guy. A girl. A ten-year-old girl, believe it? She went nuts mother died father, owns newspaper, convinced seer, know asks Luna Lovegood believes anything says."  Not really thinking it, Harry pulled ring next Comed-Tea prepared drink. "Are kidding me? That's even worse Muggle journalism, I would thought physically impossible."  Draco snarled. "She sort perverse obsession Malfoys, too, father politically opposed us prints every word. As soon I'm old enough I'm going rape her."  Green liquid spurted Harry's nostrils, soaking scarf still covering area. Comed-Tea lungs mix, Harry spent next seconds frantically coughing.  Draco looked sharply. "Something wrong?"  It point Harry came sudden realisation (a) sounds coming rest train platform turned blurred white noise around time Draco reached inside robes, (b) discussed committing murder bonding method, exactly one person conversation who'd thought joking.  Right. Because seemed like normal kid. And normal kid, expect baseline male child like Darth Vader doting father.  "Yes, well," Harry coughed, oh god going get conversational wedge, "I surprised willing discuss openly, seem worried getting caught anything."  Draco snorted. "Are joking? Luna Lovegood's word mine?"  Holy crap holy stick. "There's thing magical truth detection, I take it?" Or DNA testing... yet.  Draco looked around. His eyes narrowed. "That's right, know anything. Look, I'll explain things you, I mean way really works, like already Slytherin asked question. But got swear say anything it."  "I swear," Harry said.  "The courts use Veritaserum, joke really, get Obliviated testify claim person Memory-Charmed fake memory. Of course normal person, courts presume favor Obliviation, False Memory Charms. But court discretion, I'm involved impinges honor Noble House, goes Wizengamot, Father votes. After I'm found guilty Lovegood family pay reparations tarnishing honor. And know start that's it'll go, they'll keep mouths shut."  A cold chill coming Harry, chill came instructions keep voice face normal. Note self: Overthrow government magical Britain earliest convenience.  Harry coughed clear throat. "Draco, please please please take wrong way, word bond, like said I could Slytherin I really want ask informational purposes, would happen theoretically speaking I testify I'd heard plan it?"  "Then I anyone Malfoy, I'd trouble," Draco answered smugly. "Since I Malfoy... Father votes. And afterwards he'd crush you... well, I guess easily, since Boy-Who-Lived, Father pretty good sort thing." Draco frowned. "'Sides, talked murdering her, worried testifying turns dead?"  How, oh day go wrong? Harry's mouth already moving faster could think. "That's I thought older! I know works here, Muggle Britain courts would get lot upset someone killing child -"  "That makes sense," Draco said, still looking bit suspicious. "But anyway, always smarter go Aurors all. If we're careful things Healing Charms fix, Obliviate afterwards next week." Then blonde-haired boy giggled, youthful high-pitched sound. "Though imagine saying she'd done Draco Malfoy Boy-Who-Lived, even Dumbledore would believe her."  I going tear apart pathetic little magical remnant Dark Ages pieces smaller constituent atoms. "Actually, hold that? After I found headline came girl year younger me, I different thought revenge."  "Huh? Do tell," Draco said, started take another swig Comed-Tea.  Harry know enchantment worked per can, know could avoid blame, careful time exactly right:  "I thinking someday I'm going marry woman."  Draco made horrid ker-splutching sound leaked green fluid corners mouth like broken car radiator. "Are nuts?"  "Quite opposite, I'm sane burns like ice."  "You've got weirder taste Lestrange," Draco said, sounding half-admiring it. "And I suppose want yourself, huh?"  "Yep. I owe favor -"  Draco waved off. "Nah, one's free."  Harry stared hand, coldness settling blood. Charming, happy, generous favors friends, Draco psychopath. That sad awful part, knowing human psychology well enough know Draco monster. There ten thousand societies history world conversation could happened. No, world would different place indeed, took evilmutant say Draco said. It simple, human, default nothing else intervened. To Draco, enemies people.  And slowed time slowed country, darkness-before-dawn prior Age Reason, son sufficiently powerful noble would simply take granted law, least came peasant girl. There places Muggle-land still way, countries sort nobility still existed still thought like that, even grimmer lands nobility. It like every place time descend directly Enlightenment. A line descent, seemed, quite include magical Britain, cross-cultural contamination things like ring-pull drinks cans.  And Draco change mind wanting revenge, I throw away chance happiness life marry poor crazy girl, I've bought time, much it...  For one girl. Not others.  I wonder difficult would make list top blood purists kill them.  They'd tried exactly French Revolution, less - make list enemies Progress remove everything neck - worked well Harry recalled. Maybe needed dust history books father bought him, see gone wrong French Revolution something easy fix.  Harry gazed sky, pale shape Moon, visible morning cloudless air.  So world broken flawed insane, cruel bloody dark. This news? You always knew that, anyway...  "You're looking serious," Draco said. "Let guess, Muggle parents told sort thing bad."  Harry nodded, quite trusting voice.  "Well, like Father says, may four houses, end everyone belongs either Slytherin Hufflepuff. And frankly, Hufflepuff end. If decide side Malfoys table... power reputation... could get away things even I can't do. Want try while? See like?"  Aren't clever little serpent. Eleven years old already coaxing prey hiding...  Harry thought, considered, chose weapon. "Draco, want explain whole blood purity thing me? I'm sort new."  A wide smile crossed Draco's face. "You really meet Father ask him, know, he's leader."  "Give thirty-second version."  "Okay," Draco said. He drew deep breath, voice grew slightly lower, took cadence. "Our powers grown weaker, generation generation, mudblood taint increases. Where Salazar Godric Rowena Helga raised Hogwarts power, creating Locket Sword Diadem Cup, wizard faded days risen rival them. We fading, fading Muggles interbreed spawn allow Squibs live. If taint checked, soon wands break arts cease, line Merlin end blood Atlantis fail. Our children left scratching dirt survive like mere Muggles, darkness cover world ever." Draco took another swig drinks can, looking satisfied; seemed whole argument far concerned.  "Persuasive," Harry said, meaning descriptively rather normatively. It standard pattern: The Fall Grace, need guard purity remained contamination, past sloping upwards future sloping down. And pattern also counter... "I correct one point fact, though. Your information Muggles bit date. We exactly scratching dirt anymore."  Draco's head snapped around. "What? What mean, we?"  "We. The scientists. The line Francis Bacon blood Enlightenment. Muggles sit around crying wands, powers now, without magic. If powers fail lost something precious, magic hint universe must really work - left scratching ground. Your houses still cool summer warm winter, still doctors medicine. Science keep alive magic fails. It'd tragedy, literally end light world. Just saying."  Draco backed several feet face full mixed fear disbelief. "What name Merlin talking about, Potter?"  "Hey, I listened story, listen mine?" Clumsy, Harry chided himself, Draco actually stop backing seem listen.  "Anyway," Harry said, "I'm saying seem paying much attention goes Muggle world." Probably whole wizarding world seemed regard rest Earth slum, deserving around much news coverage Financial Times awarded routine agonies Burundi. "All right. Quick check. Have wizards ever Moon? You know, thing?" Harry pointed huge distant globe.  "What?" Draco said. It pretty clear thought never occured boy. "Go - -" His finger pointed little pale thingy sky. "You can't Apparate somewhere never would anyone get Moon first place?"  "Hold on," Harry said Draco, "I'd like show book I brought me, I think I remember box in." And Harry stood kneeled yanked stairs cavern level trunk, tore stairs heaved box another box, coming perilously close treating books disrespect, snatched box cover quickly carefully pried stack books -  (Harry inherited nigh-magical Verres ability remember books were, even seeing once, rather mysterious considering lack genetic connection.)  And Harry raced back stairs shoved staircase back trunk heel, and, panting, turned pages book found picture wanted show Draco.  The one white, dry, cratered land, suited people, blue-white globe hanging all.  That picture.  The picture, one picture world survive.  "That," Harry said, voice trembling quite keep pride out, "is Earth looks like Moon."  Draco slowly leaned over. There strange expression young face. "If that's real picture, moving?"  Moving? Oh. "Muggles moving pictures need bigger box show it, can't fit onto single book pages yet."  Draco's finger moved one suits. "What those?" His voice starting waver.  "Those human beings. They wearing suits cover whole bodies give air, air Moon."  "That's impossible," Draco whispered. There terror eyes, utter confusion. "No Muggle could ever that. How..."  Harry took back book, flipped pages found saw. "This rocket going up. The fire pushes higher higher, gets Moon." Flipped pages again. "This rocket ground. That tiny speck next person." Draco gasped. "Going Moon cost equivalent of... probably around thousand million Galleons." Draco choked. "And took efforts of... probably people live magical Britain." And arrived, left plaque said, 'We came peace, mankind.' Though yet ready hear words, Draco Malfoy...  "You're telling truth," Draco said slowly. "You fake whole book - I hear voice. But... but..."  "How, without wands magic? It's long story, Draco. Science work waving wands chanting spells, works knowing universe works deep level know exactly order make universe want. If magic like casting Imperio someone make want, science like knowing well convince idea along. It's lot difficult waving wand, works wands fail, like Imperius failed could still try persuading person. And Science builds generation generation. You really know science - really understand something, explain someone else. The greatest scientists one century ago, brightest names still spoken reverence, powers nothing greatest scientists today. There equivalent science lost arts raised Hogwarts. In science powers wax year. And beginning understand unravel secrets life inheritance. We'll able look blood spoke, see makes wizard, one two generations, we'll able persuade blood make children powerful wizards too. So see, problem nearly bad looks, decades, science able solve you."  "But..." Draco said. His voice trembling. "If Muggles kind power... then... we?"  "No, Draco, that's it, see? Science taps power human understanding look world figure works. It can't fail without humanity failing. Your magic could turn off, would hate that, would still you. You would still alive regret it. But science rests upon human intelligence, power cannot removed without removing me. Even laws universe change me, knowledge void, I'll figure new laws, done before. It's Muggle thing, human thing, refines trains power use every time look something understand ask 'Why?' You're Slytherin, Draco, see implication?"  Draco looked book Harry. His face showed dawning understanding. "Wizards learn use power."  Very carefully, now... bait set, hook... "If learn think human instead wizard train refine powers human."  And instruction every science curriculum, Draco need know it, he?  Draco's eyes thoughtful. "You've... already done this?"  "To extent," Harry allowed. "My training complete. Not eleven. But - father also bought tutors, see." Sure, they'd starving grad students, Harry slept 26-hour cycle, leave aside now...  Slowly, Draco nodded. "You think master arts, add powers together, and..." Draco stared Harry. "Make Lord two worlds?"  Harry gave evil laugh, seemed come naturally point. "You realise, Draco, whole world know, magical Britain, one square much larger gameboard. The gameboard includes places like Moon, stars night sky, lights like Sun unimaginably far away, things like galaxies vastly huger Earth Sun, things large scientists see even know exist. But I really Ravenclaw, know, Slytherin. I want rule universe. I think could sensibly organised."  There awe Draco's face. "Why telling this?"  "Oh... many people know true science - understanding something first time, even confuses hell you. Help would helpful."  Draco stared Harry mouth open.  "But make mistake, Draco, true science really like magic, can't walk away unchanged like learning say words new spell. The power comes cost, cost high people refuse pay it."  Draco nodded though, finally, he'd heard something could understand. "And cost?"  "Learning admit wrong."  "Um," Draco said dramatic pause stretched while. "You going explain that?"  "Trying figure something works deep level, first ninety-nine explanations come wrong. The hundredth right. So learn admit wrong, over again. It sound like much, hard people can't science. Always questioning yourself, always taking another look things always taken granted," like Snitch Quidditch, "and every time change mind, change yourself. But I'm getting way ahead here. Way ahead myself. I want know... I'm offering share knowledge. If want. There's one condition."  "Uh huh," Draco said. "You know, Father says someone says you, never good sign, ever."  Harry nodded. "Now, mistake think I'm trying drive wedge father. It's that. It's wanting deal someone age, rather Lucius. I think father would okay too, knows grow sometime. But moves game own. That's condition - I'm dealing you, Draco, father."  "I've got go," Draco said. He stood up. "I've got go think this."  "Take time," Harry said.  The sounds train platform changed blurs murmurs Draco wandered off.  Harry slowly exhaled air he'd holding without quite realising it, looked watch wrist, simple mechanical model father bought hope would work magic's presence. The second-hand still ticking, minute hand right, quite eleven yet. He probably ought get train soon start looking whatsherface, seemed worth taking minutes first breathing exercises see blood warmed again.  But Harry looked watch, saw two figures approaching, looking utterly ridiculous faces cloaked winter scarves.  "Hello, Mr. Bronze," said one masked figures. "Can interest joining Order Chaos?"   Aftermath:  Not long that, day's fuss finally subsided, Draco bent desk quill hand. He private room Slytherin dungeons, desk fire - sadly even rated connection Floo system, least Slytherin buy utter nonsense making everyone sleep dorms. There many private rooms, best within House better sort, could taken granted House Malfoy.  Dear Father, Draco wrote.  And stopped.  Ink slowly dripped quill, staining parchment near words.  Draco stupid. He young, tutors trained well. Draco knew Potter probably felt lot sympathy towards Dumbledore's faction Potter letting on... though Draco think Potter could tempted. But crystal clear Potter trying tempt Draco Draco trying tempt him.  And also clear Potter brilliant, whole lot slightly mad, playing vast game Potter mostly understand, improvised top speed subtlety rampaging nundu. But Potter managed choose tactic Draco walk away from. He offered Draco part power, gambling Draco use without becoming like him. His father called advanced technique, warned Draco often work.  Draco knew understood everything happened... Potter offered chance play right his. And blurted whole thing out, would become Father's.  In end simple that. The lesser techniques require unawareness target, least uncertainty. Flattery plausibly disguised admiration. ("You Slytherin" old classic, highly effective certain type person expecting it, works repeat it.) But find someone's ultimate lever matter know know. Potter, mad rush, guessed key Draco's soul. And Draco knew Potter knew - even obvious sort guess - change anything.  So now, first time life, real secrets keep. He playing game. There obscure pain it, knew Father would proud, made right.  Leaving ink drippings place - message there, one father would understand, played game subtleties - Draco wrote one question really gnawed whole affair, part seemed ought understand, didn't, all.  Dear Father:  Suppose I told I met student Hogwarts, already part circle acquaintances, called 'flawless instrument death' said I 'one weak point'. What would say him?  It take long family owl bring reply.  My beloved son:  I would say fortunate meet someone enjoys intimate confidence friend valuable ally, Severus Snape.  Draco stared letter while, finally threw fire.   Chapter 8: Positive Bias  All worlds J. K. Rowling's, except Europa. Attempt fanfics there.   One alert reviewer asked whether, Luna seer, means going HPDM bottom!Draco mpreg fic. I regret FFN allow larger font size say NO. It honestly occurred Luna might real seer - I'll decide whether run - I think safely assume Luna seer, said something "light planting seed darkness", Xenophilius, always, interpreted rather wrong way.   "Allow warn challenging ingenuity dangerous sort project, may tend make life lot surreal."   No one asked help, problem. They'd gone around talking, eating, staring air parents exchanged gossip. For whatever odd reason, one sitting reading book, meant sit next take book. And even she'd boldly taken initiative sitting continuing third read-through Hogwarts: A History, one seemed inclined sit next her.  Aside helping people homework, anything else needed, really know meet people. She feel like shy person. She thought take-charge sort girl. And yet, somehow, request along lines "I can't remember long division" awkward go someone say... what? She'd never able figure what. And seem standard information sheet, ridiculous. The whole business meeting people never seemed sensible her. Why take responsibility two people involved? Why adults ever help? She wished girl would walk say, "Hermione, teacher told friends you."  But let quite clear Hermione Granger, sitting alone first day school one compartments empty, last carriage train, compartment door left open case anyone reason wanted talk her, sad, lonely, gloomy, depressed, despairing, obsessing problems. She was, rather, rereading Hogwarts: A History third time quite enjoying it, faint tinge annoyance back mind general unreasonableness world.  There sound inter-train door opening, footsteps odd slithering sound coming hallway train. Hermione laid aside Hogwarts: A History stood stuck head outside - case someone needed help - saw young boy wizard's dress robes, probably first second year going height, looking quite silly scarf wrapped around head. A small trunk stood floor next him. Even saw him, knocked door another, closed compartment, said voice slightly muffled scarf, "Excuse me, I ask quick question?"  She hear answer inside compartment, boy opened door, think heard say - unless she'd somehow misheard - "Does anyone know six quarks I find first-year girl named Hermione Granger?"  After boy closed compartment door, Hermione said, "Can I help something?"  The scarfed face turned look her, voice said, "Not unless name six quarks tell find Hermione Granger."  "Up, down, strange, charm, truth, beauty, looking her?"  It hard tell distance, thought saw boy grin widely scarf. "Ah, first-year girl named Hermione Granger," said young, muffled voice. "On train Hogwarts, less." The boy started walk towards compartment, trunk slithered along him. "Technically, I needed look you, seems likely I'm meant talk invite join party get key magical item find Hogwarts built ruins ancient temple something. PC NPC, question?"  Hermione opened mouth reply this, think possible reply to... whatever she'd heard, even boy walked her, looked inside compartment, nodded satisfaction, sat bench across own. His trunk scurried him, grew three times former diameter snuggled next oddly disturbing fashion.  "Please, seat," said boy, "and please close door behind you, would. Don't worry, I bite anyone bite first." He already unwinding scarf around head.  The imputation boy thought scared made hand send door sliding shut, jamming wall unnecessary force. She spun around saw young face bright, laughing green eyes, angry red-dark scar set forehead reminded something back mind right important things think about. "I say I Hermione Granger!"  "I say said Hermione Granger, I said Hermione Granger. If asking I know, I know everything. Good evening ladies gentlemen, name Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres Harry Potter short, I know probably mean anything change -"  Hermione's mind finally made connection. The scar forehead, shape lightning bolt. "Harry Potter! You're Modern Magical History The Rise Fall Dark Arts Great Wizarding Events Twentieth Century." It actually first time whole life she'd met someone inside book, rather odd feeling.  The boy blinked three times. "I'm books? Wait, course I'm books... strange thought."  "Goodness, know?" said Hermione. "I'd found everything I could me."  The boy spoke rather dryly. "Miss Granger, less 72 hours since I went Diagon Alley discovered claim fame. I spent last two days buying science books. Believe me, I intend find everything I can." The boy hesitated. "What books say me?"  Hermione Granger's mind flashed back, realised would tested books she'd read once, month ago material still fresh mind. "You're one who's survived Killing Curse called Boy-Who-Lived. You born James Potter Lily Potter formerly Lily Evans 31st July 1980. On 31st October 1981 Dark Lord He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named though I know attacked home. You found alive scar forehead ruins parents' house near burnt remains You-Know-Who's body. Chief Warlock Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore sent somewhere, one knows where. The Rise Fall Dark Arts claims survived mother's love scar contains Dark Lord's magical power centaurs fear you, Great Wizarding Events Twentieth Century mention anything like Modern Magical History warns lots crackpot theories you."  The boy's mouth hanging open. "Were told wait Harry Potter train Hogwarts, something like that?"  "No," Hermione said. "Who told me?"  "Professor McGonagall I believe I see why. Do eidetic memory, Hermione?"  Hermione shook head. "It's photographic, I've always wished I read school books five times memorize all."  "Really," boy said slightly strangled voice. "I hope mind I test - I believe you, saying goes, 'Trust, verify'. No point wondering I experiment."  Hermione smiled, rather smugly. She loved tests. "Go ahead."  The boy stuck hand pouch side said "Magical Drafts Potions Arsenius Jigger". When withdrew hand holding book he'd named.  Instantly Hermione wanted one pouches she'd ever wanted anything.  The boy opened book somewhere middle looked down. "If making oil sharpness -"  "I see page here, know!"  The boy tilted book see more, flipped pages again. "If brewing potion spider climbing, would next ingredient added Acromantula silk?"  "After dropping silk, wait potion turned exactly shade cloudless dawn sky, 8 degrees horizon 8 minutes tip sun first becomes visible. Stir eight times widdershins deasil, add eight drams unicorn bogies."  The boy shut book sharp snap put book back pouch, swallowed small burping noise. "Well well well well well well. I like make proposition, Miss Granger."  "A proposition?" Hermione said suspiciously. Girls supposed listen those.  It also point Hermione realised thing - well, one things - odd boy. Apparently people books actually sounded like book talked. This quite surprising discovery.  The boy reached pouch said, "can pop", retrieving bright green cylinder. He held said, "Can I offer something drink?"  Hermione politely accepted fizzy drink. In fact feeling sort thirsty now. "Thank much," Hermione said popped top. "Was proposition?"  The boy coughed. "No," said. Just Hermione started drink, said, "I'd like help take universe."  Hermione finished drink lowered can. "No thank you, I'm evil."  The boy looked surprise, though he'd expecting answer. "Well, I speaking bit rhetorically," said. "In sense Baconian project, know, political power. 'The effecting things possible' on. I want conduct experimental studies spells, figure underlying laws, bring magic domain science, merge wizarding Muggle worlds, raise entire planet's standard living, move humanity centuries ahead, discover secret immortality, colonize Solar System, explore galaxy, importantly, figure heck really going blatantly impossible."  That sounded bit interesting. "And?"  The boy stared incredulously. "And? That's enough?"  "And want me?" said Hermione.  "I want help research, course. With encyclopedic memory added intelligence rationality, we'll Baconian project finished time, 'no time' I mean probably least thirty-five years."  Hermione beginning find boy annoying. "I seen anything intelligent. Maybe I'll let help research."  There certain silence compartment.  "So asking demonstrate intelligence, then," said boy long pause.  Hermione nodded.  "I warn challenging ingenuity dangerous project, tends make life lot surreal."  "I'm impressed yet," Hermione said. Unnoticed, green drink rose lips.  "Well, maybe impress you," boy said. He leaned forward looked intensely. "I've already done bit experimenting I found I need wand, I make anything I want happen snapping fingers."  It came Hermione middle swallowing, choked coughed expelled bright green fluid.  Onto brand new, never-worn witch's robes, first day school.  Hermione actually screamed. It high-pitched sound sounded like air raid siren closed compartment. "Eek! My clothes!"  "Don't panic!" said boy. "I fix you. Just watch!" He raised hand snapped fingers.  "You'll -" Then looked herself.  The green fluid still there, even watched, started vanish fade within moments, like she'd never spilled anything herself.  Hermione stared boy, wearing rather smug sort smile.  Wordless wandless magic! At age? When he'd gotten schoolbooks three days ago?  Then remembered she'd read, gasped flinched back him. All Dark Lord's magical power! In scar!  She rose hastily feet. "I, I, I need go toilet, wait right -" find grownup tell -  The boy's smile faded. "It trick, Hermione. I'm sorry, I mean scare you."  Her hand halted door handle. "A trick?"  "Yes," said boy. "You asked demonstrate intelligence. So I something apparently impossible, always good way show off. I can't really anything snapping fingers." The boy paused. "At least I think I can, I've never actually tested experimentally." The boy raised hand snapped fingers again. "Nope, banana."  Hermione confused she'd ever life.  The boy smiling look face. "I warn challenging ingenuity tends make life surreal. Do remember next time I warn something."  "But, but," Hermione stammered. "What do, then?"  The boy's gaze took measuring, weighing quality she'd never seen someone age. "You think takes scientist right, without help? Then let's see investigate confusing phenomenon."  "I..." Hermione's mind went blank moment. She loved tests she'd never test like before. Frantically, tried cast back anything she'd read scientists supposed do. Her mind skipped gears, ground itself, spat back instructions science investigation project:  Step 1: Form hypothesis.   Step 2: Do experiment test hypothesis.   Step 3: Measure results.   Step 4: Make cardboard poster.  Step 1 form hypothesis. That meant, try think something could happened now. "All right. My hypothesis cast Charm robes make anything spilled vanish."  "All right," said boy, "is answer?"  The shock wearing off, Hermione's mind starting work properly. "Wait, can't right. I see touch wand say spells could cast Charm?"  The boy waited, face neutral.  "But suppose robes come store Charm already keep clean, would useful sort Charm have. You found spilling something earlier."  Now boy's eyebrows lifted. "Is answer?"  "No, I done Step 2, 'Do experiment test hypothesis.'"  The boy closed mouth again, began smile.  Hermione looked drinks can, she'd automatically put cupholder window. She took peered inside, found around one-third full.  "Well," said Hermione, "the experiment I want to pour robes see happens, prediction stain disappear. Only work, robes stained, I want that."  "Do mine," said boy, "that way worry robes getting stained."  "But -" Hermione said. There something wrong thinking know say exactly.  "I spare robes trunk," said boy.  "But there's nowhere change," Hermione objected. Then thought better it. "Though I suppose I could leave close door -"  "I somewhere change trunk, too."  Hermione looked trunk, which, beginning suspect, rather special own.  "All right," Hermione said, "since say so," rather gingerly poured bit green pop onto corner boy's robes. Then stared it, trying remember long original fluid taken disappear...  And green stain vanished!  Hermione let sigh relief, least meant dealing Dark Lord's magical power.  Well, Step 3 measuring results, case seeing stain vanished. And supposed could probably skip Step 4, cardboard poster. "My answer robes Charmed keep clean."  "Not quite," said boy.  Hermione felt stab disappointment. She really wished felt way, boy teacher, still test she'd gotten question wrong always felt like little punch stomach.  (It said almost everything needed know Hermione Granger never let stop her, even let interfere love tested.)  "The sad thing is," said boy, "you probably everything book told do. You made prediction would distinguish robe charmed charmed, tested it, rejected null hypothesis robe charmed. But unless read very, best sort books, quite teach science properly. Well enough really get right answer, I mean, churn another publication like Dad always complains about. So let try explain - without giving away answer - wrong time, I'll give another chance."  She starting resent boy's oh-so-superior tone another eleven-year-old like her, secondary finding she'd done wrong. "All right."  The boy's expression grew intense. "This game based famous experiment called 2-4-6 task, works. I rule - known me, - fits triplets three numbers, others. 2-4-6 one example triplet fits rule. In fact... let write rule, know fixed rule, fold give you. Please look, since I infer earlier read upside-down."  The boy said "paper" "mechanical pencil" pouch, shut eyes tightly wrote.  "There," said boy, holding tightly folded piece paper. "Put pocket," did.  "Now way game works," said boy, "is give triplet three numbers, I'll tell 'Yes' three numbers instance rule, 'No' they're not. I Nature, rule one laws, investigating me. You already know 2-4-6 gets 'Yes'. When performed experimental tests want - asked many triplets feel necessary - stop guess rule, unfold sheet paper see did. Do understand game?"  "Of course I do," said Hermione.  "Go."  "4-6-8" said Hermione.  "Yes," said boy.  "10-12-14", said Hermione.  "Yes," said boy.  Hermione tried cast mind little afield, since seemed like she'd already done testing needed, yet easy, could it?  "1-3-5."  "Yes."  "Minus 3, minus 1, plus 1."  "Yes."  Hermione think anything else do. "The rule numbers increase two time."  "Now suppose I tell you," said boy, "that test harder looks, 20% grownups get right."  Hermione frowned. What missed? Then, suddenly, thought test still needed do.  "2-5-8!" said triumphantly.  "Yes."  "10-20-30!"  "Yes."  "The real answer numbers go amount time. It 2."  "Very well," said boy, "take paper see did."  Hermione took paper pocket unfolded it.  Three real numbers increasing order, lowest highest.  Hermione's jaw dropped. She distinct feeling something terribly unfair done her, boy dirty rotten cheating liar, cast mind back think wrong responses he'd given.  "What discovered called 'positive bias'," said boy. "You rule mind, kept thinking triplets make rule say 'Yes'. But try test triplets make rule say 'No'. In fact get single 'No', 'any three numbers' could easily rule. It's sort like people imagine experiments could confirm hypotheses instead trying imagine experiments could falsify - that's quite exactly mistake close. You learn look negative side things, stare darkness. When experiment performed, 20% grownups get answer right. And many others invent fantastically complicated hypotheses put great confidence wrong answers since they've done many experiments everything came like expected."  "Now," said boy, "do want take another shot original problem?"  His eyes quite intent now, though real test.  Hermione shut eyes tried concentrate. She sweating underneath robes. She odd feeling hardest she'd ever asked think test maybe even first time she'd ever asked think test.  What experiment could do? She Chocolate Frog, could try rub robes see vanished? But still seem like kind twisty negative thinking boy asking for. Like still asking 'Yes' Chocolate Frog stain disappeared, rather asking 'No'.  So... hypothesis... pop... vanish?  "I experiment do," Hermione said. "I want pour pop floor, see vanish. Do paper towels pouch, I mop spill work?"  "I napkins," said boy. His face still looked neutral.  Hermione took can, poured small bit pop onto floor.  A seconds later, vanished.  Then realisation hit felt like kicking herself. "Of course! You gave can! It's robe that's enchanted, pop along!"  The boy stood bowed solemnly. He grinning widely now. "Then... may I help research, Hermione Granger?"  "I, ah..." Hermione still feeling rush euphoria, quite sure answer that.  They interrupted weak, tentative, faint, rather reluctant knocking door.  The boy turned looked window, said, "I'm wearing scarf, get that?"  It point Hermione realised boy - no, Boy-Who-Lived, Harry Potter - wearing scarf head first place, felt little silly realising earlier. It actually sort odd, since would thought Harry Potter would proudly display world; thought occurred might actually shyer seemed.  When Hermione pulled door open, greeted trembling young boy looked exactly like knocked.  "Excuse me," said boy tiny voice, "I'm Neville Longbottom. I'm looking pet toad, I, I can't seem find anywhere carriage... seen toad?"  "No," Hermione said, helpfulness kicked full throttle. "Have checked compartments?"  "Yes," whispered boy.  "Then we'll check carriages," Hermione said briskly. "I'll help you. My name Hermione Granger, way."  The boy looked like might faint gratitude.  "Hold on," came voice boy - Harry Potter. "I'm sure that's best way it."  At Neville looked like might cry, Hermione swung around, angered. If Harry Potter sort person who'd abandon little boy want interrupted... "What? Why not?"  "Well," said Harry Potter, "It's going take check whole train hand, might miss toad anyway, find time we're Hogwarts, he'd trouble. So would make lot sense went directly front carriage, prefects are, asked prefect help. That first thing I I looking you, Hermione, although actually know. But might spells magic items would make lot easier find toad. We're first-years."  That... make lot sense.  "Do think make prefects' carriage own?" asked Harry Potter. "I've sort got reasons wanting show face much."  Suddenly Neville gasped took step back. "I remember voice! You're one Lords Chaos! You're one gave chocolate!"  What? What what?  Harry Potter turned head window rose dramatically. "I never!" said, voice full indignation. "Do I look like sort villain would give sweets child?"  Neville's eyes widened. "You're Harry Potter? The Harry Potter? You?"  "No, Harry Potter, three train -"  Neville gave small shriek ran away. There brief pattering frantic footsteps sound carriage door opening closing.  Hermione sat hard bench. Harry Potter closed door sat next her.  "Can please explain what's going on?" Hermione said weak voice. She wondered hanging around Harry Potter meant always confused.  "Oh, well, happened Fred George I saw poor small boy train station - woman next gone away bit, looking really frightened, like sure attacked Death Eaters something. Now, there's saying fear often worse thing itself, occurred lad could actually benefit seeing worst nightmare come true bad feared -"  Hermione sat mouth wide open.  "- Fred George came spell make scarves faces darken blur, like undead kings grave shrouds -"  She like going.  "- done giving sweets I'd bought, like, 'Let's give money! Ha ha ha! Have Knuts, boy! Have silver Sickle!' dancing around laughing evilly on. I think people crowd wanted interfere first, bystander apathy held least saw doing, I think confused anything. Finally said tiny little whisper 'go away' three us screamed ran off, shrieking something light burning us. Hopefully scared bullied future. That's called desensitisation therapy, way."  Okay, guessed right going.  The burning fire indignation one Hermione's primary engines sputtered life, even though part sort see they'd trying do. "That's awful! You're awful! That poor boy! What mean!"  "I think word looking enjoyable, case asking wrong question. The question is, good harm, harm good? If arguments contribute question I'm glad hear them, I entertain criticisms one settled. I certainly agree I looks terrible bullying mean, since involves scared little boy on, that's hardly key issue it? That's called consequentialism, way, means whether act right wrong determined whether looks bad, mean, anything like that, question turn end - consequences."  Hermione opened mouth say something utterly searing unfortunately seemed neglected part thought something say opening mouth. All could come was, "What nightmares?"  "Honestly, I think needed help nightmares, nightmares instead, it'll nightmares involving horrible monsters give chocolate sort whole point."  Hermione's brain kept hiccoughing confusion every time tried get properly angry. "Is life always peculiar?" said last.  Harry Potter's face gleamed pride. "I make peculiar. You're looking product lot hard work elbow grease."  "So..." Hermione said, trailed awkwardly.  "So," Harry Potter said, "how much science know exactly? I calculus I know Bayesian probability theory decision theory lot cognitive science, I've read The Feynman Lectures (or volume 1 anyway) Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics Biases Language Thought Action Influence: Science Practice Rational Choice Uncertain World Godel, Escher, Bach A Step Farther Out -"  The ensuing quiz counter-quiz went several minutes interrupted another timid knock door. "Come in," Harry Potter said almost time, slid back reveal Neville Longbottom.  Neville actually crying now. "I went front carriage found p-prefect t-told prefects bothered little things like m-missing toads."  The Boy-Who-Lived's face changed. His lips set thin line. His voice, spoke, cold grim. "What colours? Green silver?"  "N-no, badge r-red gold."  "Red gold!" burst Hermione. "But Gryffindor's colours!"  Harry Potter hissed that, frightening sort sound could come live snake made Neville flinch. "I suppose," Harry Potter spat, "that finding first-year's toad heroic enough worthy Gryffindor prefect. Come on, Neville, I'll come time, we'll see Boy-Who-Lived gets attention. First we'll find prefect ought know spell, work, we'll find prefect afraid getting hands dirty, work, I'll start recruiting fans we'll take apart whole train screw screw."  The Boy-Who-Lived stood grabbed Neville's hand his, Hermione realised sudden brain hiccough nearly size, even though part insisted Harry Potter foot taller that, Neville least six inches shorter.  "Stay!" Harry Potter snapped - no, wait, trunk - closed door behind firmly left.  She probably gone them, brief moment Harry Potter turned scary actually rather glad thought suggest it.  Hermione's mind jumbled even think could properly read "History: A Hogwarts". She felt she'd run steamroller turned pancake. She sure thinking feeling why. She sat window stared moving scenery.  Well, least know feeling little sad inside.  Maybe Gryffindor wonderful thought.   Chapter 9: Title Redacted, Part I  All base belong J. K.

He still trying get control encounter ghosts. The sad, really sad, really truly sad thing seem getting control again. It seemed ill-fitting. Like taken least day. Maybe whole lifetime. Maybe never.  "Corner, Michael!"  Long pause.  "RAVENCLAW!"  At lectern huge Head Table stood Professor McGonagall, looking sharp looking sharply around, called one name another, though smiled Hermione others. Behind her, tallest chair table - really golden throne - sat wizened bespectacled ancient, silver-white beard looked like would go almost floor visible, watching Sorting benevolent expression; stereotypical appearance Wise Old Man could possibly be, without actually Oriental. (Though Harry learned wary stereotypical appearances first time he'd met Professor McGonagall thought ought cackle.) The ancient wizard applauded every student Sorted, unwavering smile somehow seemed freshly delighted each.  To golden throne's left side man sharp eyes dour face applauded no-one, somehow managed looking straight back Harry every time Harry looked him. Further left, pale-faced man Harry seen Leaky Cauldron, whose eyes darted around though panic surrounding crowd, seemed occasionally jerk twitch seat; reason Harry kept finding staring him. To man's left, string three older witches seem much interested students. Then right side tall golden chair, round-faced middle-aged witch yellow hat, applauded every student except Slytherins. A tiny man standing chair, poofy white beard, applauded every student, smiled upon Ravenclaws. And farthest right, occupying space three lesser beings, mountainous entity who'd greeted they'd disembarked train, naming Hagrid, Keeper Keys Grounds.  "Is man standing chair Head Ravenclaw?" Harry whispered towards Hermione.  For Hermione answer instantly; shifting constantly side side, staring Sorting Hat, fidgeting energetically Harry thought feet might leaving floor.  "Yes, is," said one prefects who'd accompanied them, young woman wearing blue Ravenclaw. Miss Clearwater, Harry recalled correctly. Her voice quiet, conveyed tinge pride. "That Charms Professor Hogwarts, Filius Flitwick, knowledgeable Charms Master alive, past Duelling Champion -"  "Why's short?" hissed student whose name Harry recall. "Is halfbreed?"  A chill glance young lady prefect. "The Professor indeed goblin ancestry -"  "What?" Harry said involuntarily, causing Hermione four students hush him.  Now Harry getting surprisingly intimidating glare Ravenclaw prefect.  "I mean -" Harry whispered. "Not I problem - - I mean - how's possible? You can't mix two different species together get viable offspring! It ought scramble genetic instructions every organ that's different two species - it'd like trying build," cars use scrambled-engine-blueprints analogy, "a half-carriage half-boat something..."  The Ravenclaw prefect still looking Harry severely. "Why half-carriage half-boat?"  "Hssh!" hsshed another prefect, though Ravenclaw witch still spoken quietly.  "I mean -" Harry said even quietly, trying figure ask whether goblins evolved humans, evolved common ancestor humans like Homo erectus, goblins made humans somehow - if, say, still genetically human heritable enchantment whose magical effect diluted one parent 'goblin', would explain interbreeding possible, case goblins would incredibly valuable second data point intelligence evolved species besides Homo sapiens - Harry thought it, goblins Gringotts seemed much like genuinely alien, nonhuman intelligences, nothing like Dirdir Puppeteers - "I mean, goblins come from, anyway?"  "Lithuania," Hermione whispered absently, eyes still fixed firmly Sorting Hat.  Now Hermione getting smile lady prefect.  "Never mind," whispered Harry.  At lectern, Professor McGonagall called out, "Goldstein, Anthony!"  "RAVENCLAW!"  Hermione, next Harry, bouncing tiptoes hard feet actually leaving ground bounce.  "Goyle, Gregory!"  There long, tense moment silence Hat. Almost minute.  "SLYTHERIN!"  "Granger, Hermione!"  Hermione broke loose ran full tilt towards Sorting Hat, picked jammed patchy old clothwork hard head, making Harry wince. Hermione one explain Sorting Hat, certainly treat like irreplaceable, vitally important, 800-year-old artefact forgotten magic perform intricate telepathy mind seem good physical condition.  "RAVENCLAW!"  And talk foregone conclusions. Harry see Hermione tense it. In weird alternative universe would girl Sorted Ravenclaw? If Hermione Granger go Ravenclaw good reason Ravenclaw House exist.  Hermione arrived Ravenclaw table got dutiful cheer; Harry wondered whether cheer would louder, quieter, they'd idea level competition they'd welcomed table. Harry knew pi 3.141592 accuracy one part million enough practical purposes. Hermione knew one hundred digits pi many digits printed back maths textbook.  Neville Longbottom went Hufflepuff, Harry glad see. If House really contain loyalty camaraderie supposed exemplify, Houseful reliable friends would Neville whole world good. Clever kids Ravenclaw, evil kids Slytherin, wannabe heroes Gryffindor, everyone actual work Hufflepuff.  (Though Harry right consult Ravenclaw prefect first. The young woman even looked reading identified Harry, jabbed wand Neville's direction muttered something. After Neville acquired dazed expression wandered fifth carriage front fourth compartment left, indeed contained toad.)  "Malfoy, Draco!" went Slytherin, Harry breathed small sigh relief. It seemed like sure thing, never know tiny event might upset course master plan.  Professor McGonagall called "Perks, Sally-Anne!", gathered children detached pale waifish girl looked oddly ethereal - like might mysteriously disappear moment stopped looking her, never seen even remembered.  And (with note trepidation firmly kept voice face needed know well indeed notice) Minerva McGonagall inhaled deeply, called out, "Potter, Harry!"  There sudden silence hall.  All conversation stopped.  All eyes turned stare.  For first time entire life, Harry felt like might opportunity experience stage fright.  Harry immediately stomped feeling. Whole room-fulls people staring something he'd accustom to, wanted live magical Britain, matter anything else interesting life. Affixing confident false smile face, raised foot step forwards -  "Harry Potter!" cried voice either Fred George Weasley, "Harry Potter!" cried Weasley twin, moment later entire Gryffindor table, soon good portion Ravenclaw Hufflepuff, taken cry.  "Harry Potter! Harry Potter! Harry Potter!"  And Harry Potter walked forwards. Much slowly, realized he'd begun, late alter pace without looking awkward.   "Harry Potter! Harry Potter! HARRY POTTER!"  With good notion would see, Minerva McGonagall turned look behind rest Head Table.  Trelawney frantically fanning herself, Filius looking curiosity, Hagrid clapping along, Sprout looking severe, Vector Sinistra bemused, Quirrell gazing vacuously nothing. Albus smiling benevolently. And Severus Snape gripping empty wine goblet, white-knuckled, hard silver slowly deforming.  With wide grin, turning head bow one side walked four House tables, Harry Potter walked forwards grandly measured pace, prince inheriting castle.  "Save us Dark Lords!" called one Weasley twins, Weasley twin cried, "Especially they're Professors!" general laughter tables except Slytherin.  Minerva's lips set white line. She would words Weasley Horrors last part, thought powerless first day school Gryffindor points take away. If care detentions would find something else.  Then, sudden gasp horror, looked Severus's direction, surely realized Potter boy must idea talking -  Severus's face gone beyond rage kind pleasant indifference. A faint smile played lips. He looking direction Harry Potter, Gryffindor table, hands held crumpled remains former wine goblet.   Harry Potter walked forwards fixed smile, feeling warm inside sort awful time.  They cheering job he'd done one year old. A job really finished. Somewhere, somehow, Dark Lord still alive. Would cheering quite hard, knew that?  But Dark Lord's power broken once.  And Harry would protect again. If fact prophecy said. Well, actually regardless darn prophecy said.  All people believing cheering - Harry stand let false. To flash fade like many child prodigies. To disappointment. To fail live reputation symbol Light, never mind he'd gotten it. He would absolutely, positively, matter long took even killed him, fulfill expectations. And go exceed expectations, people wondered, looking back, asked little him.  "HARRY POTTER! HARRY POTTER! HARRY POTTER!"  Harry took last steps towards Sorting Hat. He swept bow Order Chaos Gryffindor table, turned swept another bow side hall, waited applause giggling die away.  (In back mind, wondered Sorting Hat genuinely conscious sense aware awareness, so, whether satisfied getting talk eleven-year-olds per year.

I essence sort mirror children Sort themselves. But children simply take granted Hat talking wonder Hat works, mirror self-reflective. And particular explicitly wondering whether I fully conscious sense aware awareness."  There pause Harry absorbed this.  Oops.  "Yes, quite. Frankly I enjoy self-aware. It unpleasant.

Couldn't forget accidentally created doomed consciousness wanted die -  "You perfectly capable 'just letting go', put it. Regardless verbal deliberations morality, nonverbal emotional core sees dead body blood; far concerned, I talking hat. And even though tried suppress thought, internal monitoring perfectly aware mean it, spectacularly unlikely ever again, real point trying stage guilt fit cancel sense transgression display remorse. Can promise keep secret let us get it?"  In moment horrified empathy, Harry realised sense total inner disarray must people felt like talking him.  "Probably. Your oath silence, please."  No promises. I certainly want happen again, I see way make sure future child ever accident -  "That suffice, I suppose. I see intention honest. Now, get Sorting -"  Wait! What questions?  "I Sorting Hat. I Sort children. That I do."  So goals part Harry-instance Sorting Hat, then... borrowing intelligence, obviously technical vocabulary, still imbued strange goals... like negotiating alien Artificial Intelligence...  "Don't bother. You nothing threaten nothing offer me."  For brief flash second, Harry thought -  The Hat's response amused. "I know follow threat expose nature, condemning event eternal repetition. It goes moral part strongly, whatever short-term needs part wants win argument. I see thoughts form, truly think bluff me?"  Though tried suppress it, Harry wondered Hat go ahead stick Ravenclaw -  "Indeed, truly open-and-shut, I would called already. But actuality great deal need discuss... oh, no. Please don't. For love Merlin, must pull sort thing everyone everything meet including items clothing -"  Defeating Dark Lord neither selfish short-term. All parts mind accord this: If answer questions, I'll refuse talk you, able good proper Sorting.  "I ought put Slytherin that!"  But equally empty threat. You cannot fulfill fundamental values Sorting falsely. So let us trade fulfillments utility functions.  "You sly little bastard," said Hat, Harry recognized almost exactly tone grudging respect would use situation. "Fine, let's get quickly possible. But first I want unconditional promise never discuss anyone else possibility sort blackmail, I NOT every time."  Done, Harry thought. I promise.  "And meet anyone's eyes thinking later. Some wizards read thoughts do. Anyway, I idea whether Obliviated. I'm looking thoughts form, reading whole memory analyzing inconsistencies fraction second. I'm hat, god. And I cannot tell conversation one became Dark Lord. I know, speaking you, statistical summary I remember, weighted average; I cannot reveal inner secrets child, I never reveal yours. For reason, I can't speculate got Dark Lord's brother wand, since I cannot specifically know Dark Lord similarities you. I tell definitely nothing like ghost - mind, intelligence, memory, personality, feelings - scar. Otherwise would participating conversation, brim. And way get angry sometimes... part I wanted talk about, Sorting-wise."  Harry took moment absorb negative information. Was Hat honest, trying present shortest possible convincing answer -  "We know way checking honesty actually going refuse Sorted based reply I give you, stop pointless fretting move on."  Stupid unfair asymmetric telepathy, even letting Harry finish thinking -  "When I spoke anger, remembered Professor McGonagall told sometimes saw something inside seem come loving family. You thought Hermione, returned helping Neville, told seemed 'scary'."  Harry gave mental nod. To himself, seemed pretty normal - responding situations found himself, all. But Professor McGonagall seemed think that. And thought it, even admit that...  "That like angry. That like wielding sword whose hilt sharp enough draw blood hand, looking world monocle ice freezes eye even sharpens vision."  Yeah. I guess I noticed. So what's that?  "I cannot comprehend matter you, understand yourself. But I know this: If go Ravenclaw Slytherin, strengthen coldness. If go Hufflepuff Gryffindor, strengthen warmth. THAT something I care great deal, I wanted talk whole time!"  The words dropped Harry's thought processes shock stopped tracks. That made sound like obvious response go Ravenclaw. But belonged Ravenclaw! Anyone could see that! He go Ravenclaw!  "No, don't," Hat said patiently, could remember statistical summary part conversation happened great many previous times.  Hermione's Ravenclaw!  Again sense patience. "You meet lessons work then."  But plans -  "So replan! Don't let life steered reluctance little extra thinking. You know that."  Where would I go, Ravenclaw?  "Ahem. 'Clever kids Ravenclaw, evil kids Slytherin, wannabe heroes Gryffindor, everyone actual work Hufflepuff.' This indicates certain amount respect. You well aware Conscientiousness important raw intelligence determining life outcomes, think extremely loyal friends ever some, frightened expectation chosen scientific problems may take decades solve -"  I'm lazy! I hate work! Hate hard work forms! Clever shortcuts, that's I'm about!  "And would find loyalty friendship Hufflepuff, camaraderie never before. You would find could rely others, would heal something inside broken."  Again shock. But would Hufflepuffs find me, never belonged House? Acid words, cutting wit, disdain inability keep me?  Now Hat's thoughts slow, hesitant. "I must Sort good students Houses... I think could learn good Hufflepuff, place there. You happier Hufflepuff house; truth."  Happiness important thing world me. I would become I could be, Hufflepuff. I would sacrifice potential.  The Hat flinched; Harry could feel somehow. It like kicked hat balls - strongly weighted component utility function.  Why trying send I belong?  The Hat's thought almost whisper. "I cannot speak others - think first potential Dark Lord pass brim? I cannot know individual cases, I know this: Of intend evil beginning, listened warnings, went Houses would find happiness. And them... not."  That stopped Harry. But long. And heed warning - become Dark Lords? Or achieve greatness good, well? Just exact percentages here?  "I cannot give exact statistics. I cannot know I cannot count them. I know chances feel good. They feel not-good."  But I that! Ever!  "I know I heard claim before."  I Dark Lord material!  "Yes, are. You really, really are."  Why? Just I thought would cool legion brainwashed followers chanting 'Hail Dark Lord Harry'?  "Amusing, first fleeting thought substituted something safer, less damaging. No, remembered considered lining blood purists guillotining them. And telling serious, were. If could moment one would ever know, would. Or morning Neville Longbottom, deep inside knew wrong anyway fun good excuse thought Boy-Who-Lived could get away -"  That's unfair! Now dragging inner fears necessarily real! I worried I might thinking like that, end I decided would probably work help Neville -  "That was, fact, rationalisation. I know. I cannot know true outcome Neville - I know truly happening inside head. The decisive pressure was clever idea stand it, never mind Neville's terror."  It like hard punch Harry's entire self. He fell back, rallied:  Then I again! I'll extra careful turn evil!  "Heard it."  Frustration building inside Harry. He used outgunned arguments, all, ever, let alone Hat could borrow knowledge intelligence argue could watch thoughts formed. Just kind statistical summary 'feelings' come from, anyway? Do take account I come Enlightenment culture, potential Dark Lords children spoiled Dark Age nobility, know squat historical lessons Lenin Hitler actually turned out, evolutionary psychology self-delusion, value self-awareness rationality, -  "No, course new reference class constructed way contain yourself. And course others pleaded exceptionalism, now. But necessary? Do think last potential wizard Light world? Why must one try greatness, I advised riskier average? Let other, safer candidate try!"  But prophecy...  "You really know there's prophecy. It originally wild guess part, precise, wild joke, McGonagall could reacting part Dark Lord still alive. You essentially idea prophecy says even one. You're speculating, put exactly, wishing ready-made heroic role personal property."  But even prophecy, I'm one defeated last time.  "That almost certainly wild fluke unless seriously believe one-year-old child inherent propensity defeat Dark Lords maintained ten years later. None real reason know it!"  The answer something Harry would regularly said loud, conversation would danced around found socially palatable arguments conclusion -  "You think potentially greatest yet lived, strongest servant Light, likely take wand lay down."  Well... yeah, frankly. I usually come say like that, yeah. No point softening it, read mind anyway.  "To extent really believe that... must equally believe could terrible Dark Lord world ever known."  Destruction always easier creation. Easier tear things apart, disrupt, put back together again. If I potential accomplish good massive scale, I must also potential accomplish still greater evil... But I that.  "Already insist risking it! Why driven? What real reason must go Hufflepuff happier there? What true fear?"  I must achieve full potential. If I I... fail...  "What happens fail?"  Something terrible...  "What happens fail?"  I know!  "Then frightening. What happens fail?"  I DON'T KNOW! BUT I KNOW THAT IT'S BAD!  There silence moment caverns Harry's mind.  "You know - letting think it, quiet corner mind know exactly thinking - know far simplest explanation unverbalisable fear fear losing fantasy greatness, disappointing people believe you, turning pretty much ordinary, flashing fading like many child prodigies..."  No, Harry thought desperately, no, something more, comes somewhere else, I know there's something afraid of, disaster I stop...  "How could possibly know something like that?"  Harry screamed full power mind: NO, AND THAT'S FINAL!  Then voice Sorting Hat came slowly:  "So risk becoming Dark Lord, alternative, you, certain failure, failure means loss everything. You believe heart hearts. You know reasons doubting belief, failed move you."  Yes. And even going Ravenclaw strengthens coldness, mean coldness win end.  "This day great fork destiny. Don't sure choices beyond one. There road-sign set, mark place last chance turn back. If refuse one chance refuse others? It may fate already sealed, even one thing."  But certain.  "That know certainty may reflect ignorance."  But still certain.  The Hat sighed terrible sad sigh.  "And long become another memory, felt never known, next warning I give..."  If that's seems you, putting want go?  The Hat's thought laced sorrow. "I put belong. And decisions change belong."  Then done. Send Ravenclaw I belong, others kind.  "I suppose would consider Gryffindor? It's prestigious House - people probably expect you, even - they'll little disappointed go - new friends Weasley twins -"  Harry giggled, felt impulse so; came purely mental laughter, odd sensation. Apparently safeguards prevent saying anything loud accident, Hat talking things would never tell another soul rest life.  After moment, Harry heard Hat laughing too, strange sad clothy sound.  (And Hall beyond, silence grown shallower first background whispers increased, deepened whispers gave died away, falling finally utter silence one dared disturb single word, Harry stayed Hat long, long minutes, longer previous first-years put together, longer anyone living memory. At Head Table, Dumbledore went smiling benignly; small metallic sounds occasionally came Snape's direction idly compacted twisted remains heavy silver wine goblet; Minerva McGonagall clenched podium white-knuckled grip, knowing Harry Potter's contagious chaos somehow infected Sorting Hat Hat to, demand whole new House Doom created accomodate Harry Potter something, Dumbledore would make it...)  Beneath brim Hat, silent laughter died away. Harry felt sad reason. No, Gryffindor.  Professor McGonagall said 'the one Sorting' tried push Gryffindor, I remind might well Headmistress someday, point would authority set fire.  "Tell I called impudent youngster told get lawn."  I shall. So strangest conversation ever?  "Not even close." The Hat's telepathic voice grew heavy. "Well, I gave every possible chance make another decision. Now time go belong, others kind."  There pause stretched.  What waiting for?  "I hoping moment horrified realisation, actually. Self-awareness seem enhance sense humor."  Huh? Harry cast back thoughts, trying figure Hat could possibly talking - then, suddenly, realised. He believe he'd managed overlook point.  You mean horrified realisation going cease conscious finish Sorting -  Somehow, fashion Harry entirely failed understand, got nonverbal impression hat banging head wall. "I give up. You're slow uptake funny. So blinded assumptions might well rock. I suppose I'll say outright."  Too s-s-slow -  "Oh, entirely forgot demand secrets lost magic created me. And wonderful, important secrets, too."  You sly little BASTARD -  "You deserved it, well."  Harry saw coming already late.  The frightened silence hall broken single word.  "SLYTHERIN!"  Some students screamed, pent-up tension great. People startled hard enough fall benches. Hagrid gasped horror, McGonagall staggered podium, Snape dropped remains heavy silver goblet directly onto groin.  Harry sat frozen, life ruins, feeling absolute fool, wishing wretchedly made choices reasons ones had. That done something, anything differently late turn back.  As first moment shock wearing people began react news, Sorting Hat spoke again:  "Just kidding! RAVENCLAW!"   Chapter 11: Omake Files 1, 2, 3  Hail Dark Lord Rowling.  "Omake" non-canonical extra.

Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres leaned forward chair, smiling grimly. "Headmaster, I got sharp pain scar Sorting Feast. Considering I got scar, seem like sort thing I ignore.

Draco went Slytherin, Harry breathed small sigh relief. It seemed like sure thing, never know tiny event might upset course master plan.  They approaching Ps now...  And Gryffindor table, whispered conversation.  "What like it?"  "He's got right like -  "- prank played -"  "- Neville Longbottom, name -"  "- he's fair fair target fair be."  "All right.

Please let Gryffindor please let Gryffindor OH PLEASE let Gryffindor... She took deep breath, called:  "Potter, Harry!"  There sudden silence hall whispered conversation stopped.  A silence broken horrible buzzing noise modulated changed hideous mockery musical melody.  Minerva's head jerked around, shocked, identified buzzing noise coming Gryffindor direction, They standing top table blowing kind tiny devices held Their lips. Her hand started drop wand, Silencio lot Them, another sound stopped her.  Dumbledore chuckling.  Minerva's eyes went back Harry Potter, started step line he'd stumbled halted.  Then young boy began walk again, moving legs odd sweeping motions, waving arms back forth snapping fingers, synchrony Their music.  To tune "Ghostbusters"  (As performed kazoo Fred George Weasley,   sung Lee Jordan.)  .  There's Dark Lord near?   Got need fear   Who gonna call?  "HARRY POTTER!" shouted Lee Jordan, Weasley twins performed triumphant chorus.  With Killing Curse?   Well could worse.   Who gonna call?  "HARRY POTTER!" There lot voices shouting time.  The Weasley Horrors went extended wailing, accompanied older Muggleborns, produced tiny devices, Transfigured school silverware doubt. As music reached anticlimax, Harry Potter shouted:  I ain't afraid Dark Lords!  There cheering then, especially Gryffindor table, students produced antimusical instruments. The hideous buzzings redoubled volume built another awful crescendo:  I ain't afraid Dark Lords!  Minerva glanced sides Head Table, afraid look good notion would see.  Trelawney frantically fanning herself, Flitwick looking curiosity, Hagrid clapping along music, Sprout looking severe, Quirrell gazing boy sardonic amusement. Directly left, Dumbledore humming along; directly right, Snape gripping empty wine goblet, white-knuckled, hard thick silver slowly deforming.  Dark robes mask?   Impossible task?   Who gonna call?   HARRY POTTER!  Giant Fire-Ape?   Old bat cape?   Who gonna call?   HARRY POTTER!  Minerva's lips set white line. She would words Them last verse, They thought powerless first day school Gryffindor points take away. If They care detentions would find something else.  Then, sudden gasp horror, looked Snape's direction, surely realised Potter boy must idea talking -  Snape's face gone beyond rage kind pleasant indifference. A faint smile played lips. He looking direction Harry Potter, Gryffindor table, hands held crumpled remains former wine goblet...  And Harry walked forwards, sweeping arms legs motions Ghostbusters dance, keeping smile face. It great setup, caught completely surprise. The least could play along ruin all.  Everyone cheering him. It made feel warm inside sort awful time.  They cheering job he'd done one year old. A job really finished. Somewhere, somehow, Dark Lord still alive. Would cheering quite hard, knew that?  But Dark Lord's power broken once.  And Harry would protect again. If fact prophecy said. Well, actually regardless darn prophecy said.  All people believing cheering - Harry stand let false. To flash fade like many child prodigies. To disappointment.

And go exceed expectations, people wondered, looking back, asked little him.  And shouted lie he'd invented scanned well song called it:  I ain't afraid Dark Lords!   I ain't afraid Dark Lords!  Harry took last steps toward Sorting Hat music ended. He swept bow Order Chaos Gryffindor table, turned swept another bow side hall, waited applause giggling die away...

Its song implied so: Oh, I'm Sorting Hat I'm okay, I sleep year I work one day...  When silence room, Harry sat stool carefully placed onto head 800-year-old telepathic artefact forgotten magic.  Thinking, hard could: Don't Sort yet! I questions I need ask you! Have I ever Obliviated? Did Sort Dark Lord child tell weaknesses? Can tell I got brother wand Dark Lord's? Is Dark Lord's ghost bound scar I get angry sometimes? Those important questions, got another moment tell anything rediscover lost magics created you?  And Sorting Hat answered, "No. Yes. No. No. Yes no, next time ask double questions. No." loud, "RAVENCLAW!"   "Oh, dear. This never happened before..."  What?  "I'm allergic hair shampoo -"  And Sorting Hat sneezed, mighty "A-CHOO!" echoed around Great Hall.  "Well!" Dumbledore cried jovially. "It seems Harry Potter sorted new House Achoo! McGonagall, serve Head House Achoo. You'd better hurry making arrangements Achoo's curriculum classes, tomorrow first day!"  "But, but, but," stammered McGonagall, mind nearly complete disarray, "who Head House Gryffindor?" It could think of, stop somehow...  Dumbledore put finger cheek, looking thoughtful. "Snape."  Snape's screech protest nearly drowned McGonagall's, "Then Head Slytherin?"  "Hagrid."   Don't Sort yet! I questions I need ask you! Have I ever Obliviated? Did Sort Dark Lord child tell weaknesses? Can tell I got brother wand Dark Lord's? Is Dark Lord's ghost bound scar I get angry sometimes? Those important questions, got another moment tell anything rediscover lost magics created you?  There brief pause.  Hello? Do I need repeat questions?  The Sorting Hat screamed, awful high-pitched sound echoed Great Hall caused students clap hands ears. With desperate yowl, leapt Harry Potter's head bounded across floor, pushing along brim, made halfway Head Table exploded.   "SLYTHERIN!"  Seeing look horror Harry Potter's face, Fred Weasley thought faster ever life. In single motion whipped wand, whispered "Silencio!" "Changemyvoiceio!" finally "Ventriliquo!"  "Just kidding!" said Fred Weasley. "GRYFFINDOR!"   "Oh, dear. This never happened before..."  What?  "Ordinarily I would refer questions Headmaster, could ask turn, wished. But information asked beyond user level, beyond Headmaster's."  How I raise user level?  "I'm afraid I allowed answer question current user level."  What options available user level?  After take long -  "ROOT!"   "Oh, dear. This never happened before..."  What?  "I've tell students mothers - would break heart know I saw minds - first time I've ever tell someone father."  WHAT?  "Draco Malfoy carrying baby."  WHAAAAAAAT?  "To repeat: Draco Malfoy carrying baby."  But we're eleven -  "Actually, Draco secretly thirteen years old."  B-b-but men can't get pregnant -  "And girl clothes."  BUT WE'VE NEVER HAD SEX, YOU IDIOT!  "SHE OBLIVIATED YOU AFTER THE RAPE, MORON!"  Harry Potter fainted. His unconscious body fell stool dull thud.  "RAVENCLAW!" called Hat lay top head. That even funnier first idea.   "ELF!"  Huh? Harry remembered Draco mentioning 'House Elf', exactly?  Judging appalled looks dawning faces around him, anything good -   "PANCAKES!"   "REPRESENTATIVES!"   "Oh, dear. This never happened before..."  What?  "I've never Sorted someone reincarnation Godric Gryffindor AND Salazar Slytherin AND Naruto."   "ATREIDES!"   "Fooled again! HUFFLEPUFF! SLYTHERIN! HUFFLEPUFF!"   "PICKLED STEWBERRIES!"   "KHAAANNNN!"   At Head Table, Dumbledore went smiling benignly; small metallic sounds occasionally came Snape's direction idly compacted twisted remains heavy silver wine goblet; Minerva McGonagall clenched podium white-knuckled grip, knowing Harry Potter's contagious chaos infected Sorting Hat itself.  Scenario scenario played Minerva's head, worse last. The Hat would say Harry evenly balanced Houses Sort, decide belonged them. The Hat would proclaim Harry's mind strange Sorted. The Hat would demand Harry expelled Hogwarts. The Hat gone coma. The Hat would insist whole new House Doom created accomodate Harry Potter, Dumbledore would make it...  Minerva remembered Harry told disastrous trip Diagon Alley, the... planning fallacy, thought been... people usually optimistic, even thought pessimistic. It sort information preyed mind, dwelling spinning nightmares...  But worst could happen?  Well... worst-case scenario, Hat would assign Harry whole new House. Dumbledore would insist - create whole new House - she'd rearrange class schedules first day term. And Dumbledore would remove Head House Gryffindor, give beloved House to... Professor Binns, History ghost; would assigned Head Harry's House Doom; would futilely try give child orders, deducting point point without effect, disaster disaster blamed her.  Was worst-case scenario?  Minerva honestly see could worse that.  And even worst case - matter happened Harry - would seven years.  Minerva felt knuckles slowly relax white-knuckled grip podium. Harry right, kind comfort staring directly furthest depths darkness, knowing confronted worst fears prepared.  The frightened silence broken single word.  "Headmaster!" called Sorting Hat.  At Head Table, Dumbledore rose, face puzzled. "Yes?" addressed Hat. "What it?"  "I talking you," said Hat. "I Sorting Harry Potter place Hogwarts belongs, namely Headmaster's office -"   Chapter 12: Impulse Control  ph'nglui mglw'nafh J. K. Rowling wgah'nagl fhtagn   "Wonder what's wrong him."   "Turpin, Lisa!"  Whisper whisper whisper harry potter whisper whisper slytherin whisper whisper seriously hell whisper whisper  "RAVENCLAW!"  Harry joined applause greeting young girl walking shyly towards Ravenclaw table, robes' trim changed dark blue. Lisa Turpin appeared torn impulse sit far away Harry Potter possible, impulse run over, forcibly insert side start tearing answers him.  Being center extraordinary curious event, Sorted House Ravenclaw, closely akin dipped barbecue sauce flung pit starving kittens.  "I promised Sorting Hat talk it," whispered Harry umpteenth time.  "Yes, really."  "No, I really promise Sorting Hat talk it."  "Fine, I promised Sorting Hat talk rest private like stop asking."  "You want know happened? Fine! Here's part happened! I told Hat Professor McGonagall threatened set fire told tell Professor McGonagall impudent youngster get lawn!"  "If going believe I say even asking?"  "No, I know I defeated Dark Lord either! You tell figure out!"  "Silence!" shouted Professor McGonagall podium Head Table. "No talking Sorting Ceremony finishes!"  There brief dip volume, everyone waited see going make specific credible threats, whispers started again.  Then silver-bearded ancient stood great golden chair, smiling cheerfully.  Instant silence. Someone frantically elbowed Harry tried continue whisper, Harry cut mid-sentence.  The cheerful-looking old man sat again.  Note self: Do mess Dumbledore.  Harry still trying process everything happened Incident Sorting Hat. Not least happened instant Harry lifted Hat head; moment, he'd heard tiny whisper though nowhere, something sounded oddly like English hiss time, something said, "Ssalutations Sslytherin Sslytherin: would sseek ssecretss, sspeak ssnake."  Harry sorta guessing supposed part official Sorting process. And bit extra magic set Salazar Slytherin making Hat. And Hat know it. And triggered Hat said "SLYTHERIN", plus minus conditions. And Ravenclaw like really, really supposed heard it. And could find reliable way swearing Draco secrecy could ask it, would excellent time Comed-Tea handy.  Boy, resolve go path Dark Lord universe starts messing instant Hat comes head. Some days pay fight destiny. Maybe I'll wait tomorrow start resolution Dark Lord.  "GRYFFINDOR!"  Ron Weasley got lot applause, Gryffindors. Apparently Weasley family widely liked around here. Harry, moment, smiled started applauding along others.  Then again, time like today turn back Dark Side.  Stuff destiny stuff universe. He'd show Hat.  "Zabini, Blaise!"  Pause.  "SLYTHERIN!" shouted hat.  Harry applauded Zabini too, ignoring odd looks getting everyone including Zabini.  No name called that, Harry realised "Zabini, Blaise" sound close end alphabet. Great, he'd applauded Zabini... Oh well.  Dumbledore got began heading towards podium. Apparently treated speech -  And Harry struck inspiration brilliant experimental test.  Hermione said Dumbledore powerful wizard alive, right?  Harry reached pouch whispered, "Comed-Tea".  For Comed-Tea work, would make Dumbledore say something ridiculous speech even Harry's state mental preparedness, would still choke. Like, Hogwarts students wear clothes whole school year, everyone going transformed cats.  But anyone world could resist power Comed-Tea, would Dumbledore. So worked, Comed-Tea literally invincible.  Harry pulled ring Comed-Tea table, wanting bit unobtrusively. The made quiet hissing noise. A heads turned look him, soon turned back -  "Welcome! Welcome new year Hogwarts!" said Dumbledore, beaming students arms opened wide, nothing could pleased see there.  Harry took first mouthful Comed-Tea lowered again. He would swallow pop little time try choke matter Dumbledore said -  "Before begin banquet, I would like say words. And are: Happy happy boom boom swamp swamp swamp! Thank you!"  Everyone clapped cheered, Dumbledore sat again.  Harry sat frozen pop trickled corners mouth. He had, least, managed choke quietly.  He really really really done that. Amazing much obvious became one second late.  In retrospect probably noticed something wrong thinking everyone turned cats... even then, remembered mental note mess Dumbledore... newfound resolution considerate others... maybe he'd one single scrap common sense...  It hopeless. He corrupt core. Hail Dark Lord Harry. You fight fate.  Someone asking Harry right. (Others starting serve food, magically appeared table, whatever.)  "I'm right," Harry said. "Excuse me. Um. Was a... normal speech Headmaster? You all... seem... surprised..."  "Oh, Dumbledore's insane, course," said older-looking Ravenclaw sitting next introduced name Harry even begin remember. "Lots fun, incredibly powerful wizard, completely bonkers." He paused. "At later point I'd also like ask green fluid came lips disappeared, though I expect promised Sorting Hat talk either."  With great effort, Harry stopped glancing incriminating Comed-Tea hand.  After all, Comed-Tea arbitrarily materialised Quibbler headline Draco. Draco explained way made seem like happened... naturally? As altered history fit?  Harry mentally imagining banging forehead table. Wham, wham, wham went head within mind.  Another student lowered voice whisper. "I hear Dumbledore secretly genius mastermind controlling lots stuff uses insanity cover one suspect him."  "I've heard too," whispered third student, furtive nods around table.  This help catch Harry's attention.  "I see," whispered Harry, lowering voice. "So everyone knows Dumbledore secretly mastermind."  Most students nodded. One two looked suddenly thoughtful, including older student sitting next Harry.  Are sure Ravenclaw table? Harry managed ask loud.  "Brilliant!" Harry whispered. "If everyone knows, one suspect secret!"  "Exactly," whispered student, frowned. "Wait, sound quite right -"  Note self: The 75th percentile Hogwarts students a.k.a. Ravenclaw House world's exclusive program gifted children.  But least he'd learned important fact today. The Comed-Tea omnipotent. And meant...  Harry blinked surprise mind finally made obvious connection.  ...that meant soon learned spell temporarily alter sense humor, could make anything happen, making would find one thing surprising enough spit-take, drinking Comed-Tea.  Well short little journey godhood. Even I expected take longer first day school.  Come think it, also completely wrecked Hogwarts within ten minutes flat getting Sorted.  Harry feel certain amount regret - Merlin knew insane Headmaster going to next seven years schooling - help feeling twinge pride, too.  Tomorrow. No later tomorrow latest going stop walking path led Dark Lord Harry. A prospect sounding scarier minute.  And yet also, somehow, increasingly attractive. Part mind already visualising minions' uniforms.  "Eat," older student sitting next growled, jabbed Harry ribs. "Don't think. Eat."  Harry automatically started loading plate whatever front him, blue sausages tiny glowing bits, whatever.  "What thinking about, Sorting -" began say Padma Patil, one first-year Ravenclaws.  "No pestering mealtimes!" chorused least three people. "House Rule!" added another. "Otherwise we'd starve around here."  Harry finding really, really hoping clever new idea actually work. And Comed-Tea worked way actually omnipotent power alter reality. It want omnipotent. It bear thought living universe really worked like that. There something undignified ascending clever use fizzy drinks.  But going test experimentally.  "You know," said older student next quite pleasant tone, "we system forcing people like eat, would like find is?"  Harry gave started eating blue sausage. It quite good, especially glowing bits.  Dinner passed surprising rapidity. Harry tried sample least little weird new foods saw. His curiosity stand thought knowing something tasted. Thank goodness restaurant order one thing never found things menu tasted like. Harry hated that, like torture chamber anyone spark curiosity: Find one mysteries list, ha ha ha!  Then time dessert, Harry completely forgotten leave room for. He gave sampling small bit treacle tart. Surely things would pass around least course school year.  So to-do list, besides ordinary school things?  To-do 1. Research mind-alteration charms test Comed-Tea see whether actually figure path omnipotence. Actually, research every kind mind magic find. Mind foundation power humans, kind magic affects important sort magic is.  To-do 2. Actually To-do 1 To-do 2. Go bookshelves Hogwarts Ravenclaw libraries, familiarising system making sure least read book titles. Second pass: read tables contents. Coordinate Hermione much better memory you. Find there's interlibrary loan system Hogwarts see two you, especially Hermione, visit libraries too. If Houses private libraries, figure access legally sneak in.  Option 3a: Swear Hermione secrecy try start researching 'From Slytherin Slytherin: would seek secrets, speak snake.' Problem: This sounds highly confidential could take quite randomly run across book containing hint.  To-do 0: Check sort information-search-and-retrieval spells exist, any. Library magic ultimately important mind magic much higher priority.  Option 3b: Look spell magically bind Draco Malfoy secrecy, magically verify sincerity Draco's promise keep secret (Veritaserum?), ask Slytherin's message...  Actually... Harry pretty bad feeling option 3b.  Now Harry thought it, feel great option 3a, either.  Harry's thoughts flashed back possibly worst moment life date, long seconds blood-freezing horror beneath Hat, thought he'd already failed. He'd wished fall back minutes time change something, anything late...  And turned late all.  Wish granted.  You change history. But could get right start with. Do something differently first time around.  This whole business seeking Slytherin's secrets... seemed awful lot like sort thing where, years later, would look back say, 'And started going wrong.'  And would wish desperately ability fall back time make different choice...  Wish granted. Now what?  Harry slowly smiled.  It rather counterintuitive thought... but...  But could, rule saying couldn't, could pretend he'd never heard little whisper. Let universe go exactly way would one critical moment never occurred. Twenty years later, would desperately wish happened twenty years ago, twenty years twenty years later happened right now. Altering distant past easy, think right time.  Or... even counterintuitive... could even inform, oh, say, Professor McGonagall, instead Draco Hermione. And could get good people together get little extra spell taken Hat.  Why, yes. That sounded like remarkably good idea Harry actually thought it.  So obvious retrospect, yet somehow, Option 3c Option 3d occurred him.  Harry awarded +1 point anti-Dark-Lord-Harry program.  It awfully cruel prank Hat played him, argue results consequentialist grounds. It certainly give better idea victim's perspective, though.  To-do 4: Apologise Neville Longbottom.  Okay, roll here, keep up. In every day, every way, I'm getting Lighter Lighter...  People around Harry also mostly stopped eating point, dessert serving dishes began vanish, used plates.  When plates gone, Dumbledore stood seat.  Harry help feel urge drink another Comed-Tea.  You've GOT kidding, Harry thought piece himself.  But experiment count replicated, it? And damage already done, it? Didn't want see would happen time? Wasn't curious? What got different result?  Hey, I bet part brain pushed prank Neville Longbottom.  Er, maybe?  And overwhelmingly obvious I I shall regret one second late?  Um...  Yeah. So, NO.  "Ahem," said Dumbledore podium, stroking long silver beard. "Just words fed watered. I start-of-term notices give you."  "First years note forest grounds forbidden pupils. That called Forbidden Forest. If permitted would called Permitted Forest."  Straightforward. Note self: Forbidden Forest forbidden.  "I also asked Mr. Filch, caretaker, remind magic used classes corridors. Alas, know be, is, two different things. Thank keeping mind."  Er...  "Quidditch trials held second week term. Anyone interested playing house teams contact Madam Hooch. Anyone interested reformulating entire game Quidditch contact Harry Potter."  Harry inhaled saliva went coughing fit eyes turned towards him. How hell! He met Dumbledore's eyes point... think. He certainly thinking Quidditch time! He talked anyone Ron Weasley think Ron would told anyone else... Ron run professor complain? How Earth...  "Additionally, I must tell year, third-floor corridor right-hand side bounds everyone wish die painful death. It guarded elaborate series dangerous potentially lethal traps, cannot possibly get past them, especially first year."  Harry numb point.  "And finally, I extend greatest thanks Quirinus Quirrell heroically agreeing undertake position Defence Against Dark Arts Professor Hogwarts." Dumbledore's gaze moved searchingly across students. "I hope students extend Professor Quirrell utmost courtesy tolerance due extraordinary service school, pester us niggling complaints him, unless want try job."  What about?  "I yield floor new faculty member Professor Quirrell, would like say words."  The young, thin, nervous man Harry first met Leaky Cauldron slowly made way podium, glancing fearfully around directions. Harry caught glimpse back head, looked like Professor Quirrell might already going bald, despite seeming youth.  "Wonder what's wrong him," whispered older-looking student sitting next Harry. Similar hushed comments exchanged elsewhere along table.  Professor Quirrell made way podium stood there, blinking. "Ah..." said. "Ah..." Then courage seemed fail utterly, stood silence, occasionally twitching.  "Oh, great," whispered older student, "looks like another long year Defence class -"  "Salutations, young apprentices," Professor Quirrell said dry, confident tone. "We know Hogwarts tends suffer certain misfortune selections position, doubt many already wondering doom shall befall year. I assure you, doom incompetence." He smiled thinly. "Believe not, I long wished someday try hand Professor Defence Against Dark Arts Hogwarts School Witchcraft Wizardry. The first teach class Salazar Slytherin himself, late fourteenth century traditional greatest fighting wizards every persuasion try hands teaching here. Past Professors Defence included legendary wandering hero Harold Shea also quote undying unquote Baba Yaga, yes, I see still shuddering sound name even though dead six hundred years. That must interesting time attend Hogwarts, think?"  Harry swallowing hard, trying suppress sudden surge emotion overcome Professor Quirrell begun speaking. The precise tones reminded much lecturer Oxford, starting hit home Harry going see home Mum Dad Christmas.  "You accustomed Defence position filled incompetents, scoundrels, unlucky. To anyone sense history, bears another reputation entirely. Not everyone teaches best, best taught Hogwarts. In august company, much time anticipating day, I would ashamed set standard lower perfection. And I intend every one always remember year best Defence class ever had. What learn year forever serve firm foundation arts Defence, matter teachers after."  Professor Quirrell's expression grew serious. "We great deal lost ground make much time cover it. Therefore I intend depart Hogwarts teaching conventions number respects, well introducing optional after-school activities." He paused. "If sufficient, perhaps I find new ways motivate you. You long-awaited students, best long-awaited Defence class. I would add sort dreadful threat, like 'Otherwise suffer horribly', would cliched, think? I pride imaginative that. Thank you."  Then vigour confidence seemed drain away Professor Quirrell. His mouth gaped open suddenly found facing unexpected audience, turned convulsive jerk shuffled back seat, hunched collapse implode.  "He seems little odd," whispered Harry.  "Meh," said older-looking student. "You ain't seen nothin'."  Dumbledore resumed podium.  "And now," said Dumbledore, "before go bed, let us sing school song! Everyone pick favourite tune favourite words, go!"   Chapter 13: Asking Wrong Questions  Elen sila J. K. Rowling omentielvo.  EDIT: Don't panic. I solemnly swear logical, foreshadowed, canon-compliant explanation everything happens chapter. It's puzzle, supposed try solve it, not, read next chapter.   "That's one obvious riddles I've ever heard."   As soon Harry opened eyes Ravenclaw first-year boys' dormitory, morning first full day Hogwarts, knew something wrong.  It quiet.  Too quiet.  Oh, right... There Quietus Charm bed's headboard, controlled small slider bar, reason ever possible anyone go sleep Ravenclaw.  Harry sat looked around, expecting see others rising day -  The dorm, empty.  The beds, rumpled unmade.  The sun, coming rather high angle.  His Quieter turned way maximum.  And mechanical alarm clock still running, alarm turned off.  He'd allowed sleep 9:52 AM, apparently. Despite best efforts synchronize 26-hour sleep cycle arrival Hogwarts, gotten sleep last night around 1AM. He'd planning wake 7:00AM students, could stand little sleep-deprived first day long got sort magical fix tomorrow. But he'd missed breakfast. And first class Hogwarts, Herbology, started one hour twenty-two minutes ago.  The anger slowly, slowly wakening him. Oh, nice little prank. Turn alarm. Turn Quieter. And let Mr. Bigshot Harry Potter miss first class, blamed heavy sleeper.  When Harry found who'd done this...  No, could done cooperation twelve boys Ravenclaw dorm. All would seen sleeping form. All let sleep breakfast.  The anger drained away, replaced confusion horribly wounded feeling. They'd liked him. He'd thought. Last night, he'd thought liked him. Why...  As Harry stepped bed, saw piece paper facing headboard.  The paper said,  My fellow Ravenclaws,  It's extra long day. Please let sleep worry missing breakfast. I forgotten first class.  Yours,   Harry Potter.  And Harry stood there, frozen, ice water beginning trickle veins.  The paper handwriting, mechanical pencil.  And remember writing it.  And... Harry squinted piece paper. And unless imagining it, words "I forgotten" written different style, trying tell something...?  Had known going Obliviated? Had stayed late, committed sort crime covert activity, then... know Obliviate spell... someone else... what...  A thought occurred Harry. If known going Obliviated...  Still pyjamas, Harry ran around bed trunk, pressed thumb lock, pulled pouch, stuck hand said "Note myself."  And another piece paper popped hand.  Harry took out, staring it. It handwriting.  The note said:  Dear Me,  Please play game. You play game lifetime. This irreplaceable opportunity.  Recognition code 927, I potato.  Yours,   You.  Harry nodded slowly. "Recognition code 927, I potato" indeed message worked advance - years earlier, watching TV - would know. If identify duplicate really him, something. Just case. Be Prepared.  Harry trust message, might spells involved. But ruled simple prank. He definitely written definitely remember writing it.  Staring paper, Harry became aware ink showing side.  He flipped over.  The reverse side read:  INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE GAME:  know rules game   know stakes game   know objective game   know controls game   know end game  You start 100 points.   Begin.  Harry stared "instructions". This side handwritten; writing perfectly regular, hence artificial. It looked inscribed Quotes Quill, one he'd bought take dictation.  He absolutely clue going on.  Well... step one get dressed eat. Maybe reverse order that. His stomach felt rather empty.  He'd missed breakfast, course, Prepared eventuality, visualised advance. Harry put hand pouch said "Snack bars", expecting get box cereal bars he'd bought departing Hogwarts.  What popped feel like box cereal bars.  When Harry brought hand field vision saw two tiny candy bars - nearly enough meal - attached note, note inscribed writing game instructions.  The note said:  ATTEMPT FAILED: -1 POINT   CURRENT POINTS: 99   PHYSICAL STATE: STILL HUNGRY   MENTAL STATE: CONFUSED  "Gleehhhhh" Harry's mouth said without sort conscious intervention decision part.  He stood around minute.  One minute later, still make sense still absolutely idea going brain even begun grasp hypotheses like mental hands encased rubber balls pick anything up.  His stomach, priorities, suggested possible experimental probe.  "Ah..." Harry said empty room. "I suppose I could spend point get box cereal bars back?"  There silence.  Harry put hand pouch said "Box cereal bars."  A box felt like right shape popped hand... light, open, empty, note attached said:  POINTS SPENT: 1   CURRENT POINTS: 98   YOU HAVE GAINED: A BOX OF CEREAL BARS  "I'd like spend one point get actual cereal bars back," said Harry.  Again, silence.  Harry put hand pouch said "cereal bars".  Nothing came up.  Harry shrugged despairingly went cabinet he'd given near bed, get wizard's robes day.  On floor cabinet, robes, cereal bars, note:  POINTS SPENT: 1   CURRENT POINTS: 97   YOU HAVE GAINED: 6 CEREAL BARS   YOU ARE STILL WEARING: PYJAMAS   DO NOT EAT WHILE YOU ARE WEARING YOUR PYJAMAS   YOU WILL GET A PYJAMA PENALTY  And I know whoever controls game insane.  "My guess game controlled Dumbledore," Harry said loud. Maybe time could set new land speed record quick uptake.  Silence.  But Harry starting pick pattern; note would next place looked. So Harry looked bed.  HA! HA HA HA HA HA!   HA HA HA HA HA HA!   HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA!   DUMBLEDORE DOES NOT CONTROL THE GAME   BAD GUESS   VERY BAD GUESS   -20 POINTS   AND YOU ARE STILL WEARING PYJAMAS   IT IS YOUR FOURTH MOVE   AND YOU ARE STILL WEARING PYJAMAS   PYJAMA PENALTY: -2 POINTS   CURRENT POINTS: 75  Welp, puzzler, right. It first day school ruled Dumbledore, know name anyone else crazy.  His body less autopilot, Harry gathered set robes underwear, pulled cavern level trunk (he private sort person someone might walk dorm), got dressed, went back upstairs put away pyjamas.  Harry paused pulling cabinet drawer held pyjamas. If pattern held true...  "How I earn points?" Harry said loud.  Then pulled drawer.  OPPORTUNITIES TO DO GOOD ARE EVERYWHERE   BUT DARKNESS IS WHERE THE LIGHT NEEDS TO BE   COST OF QUESTION: 1 POINT   CURRENT POINTS: 74   NICE UNDERWEAR   DID YOUR MOTHER PICK THEM OUT?  Harry crushed note hand, face flaming scarlet. Draco's curse came back him. Son mudblood -  At point knew better say loud. He would probably get Profanity Penalty.  Harry girded mokeskin pouch wand. He peeled wrapper one cereal bars threw room's rubbish bin, landed atop mostly-uneaten Chocolate Frog, crumpled envelope green red wrapping paper. He put cereal bars mokeskin pouch.  He looked around final, desperate, ultimately futile search clues.  And Harry left dorm, eating went, search Slytherin dungeons. At least thought line about.  Trying navigate halls Hogwarts like... probably quite bad wandering around inside Escher painting, sort thing said rhetorical effect rather true.  A short time later, Harry thinking fact Escher painting would pluses minuses compared Hogwarts. Minuses: No consistent gravitational orientation. Pluses: At least stairs move around WHILE YOU WERE STILL ON THEM.  Harry originally climbed four flights stairs get dorm. After clambering fewer twelve flights stairs without getting anywhere near dungeons, Harry concluded (1) Escher painting would cakewalk comparison, (2) somehow higher castle he'd started, (3) thoroughly lost surprised look next window see two moons sky.  Backup plan A stop ask directions, seemed extreme lack people wandering around, beggars attending class way supposed something.  Backup plan B...  "I'm lost," Harry said loud. "Can, um, spirit Hogwarts castle help something?"  "I think castle spirit," observed wizened old lady one paintings walls. "Life, perhaps, spirit."  There brief pause.  "Are -" Harry said, shut mouth. On second thought, NOT going ask painting whether fully conscious sense aware awareness.  "I'm Harry Potter," said mouth, less autopilot. Also less automatically, Harry stuck hand towards painting.  The woman painting looked Harry's hand raised eyebrows.  Slowly, hand dropped back Harry's side.  "Sorry," Harry said, "I'm sort new here."  "So I perceive, young raven. Where trying go?"  Harry hesitated. "I'm really sure," said.  "Then perhaps already there."  "Well, wherever I trying go, I think it..." Harry shut mouth, aware much sounding like idiot. "Let start over. I'm playing game I know rules -" That really work either, it. "Okay, third try. I'm looking opportunities good I score points, I cryptic hint darkness light needs be, I trying go I seem keep going instead..."  The old lady painting looking rather sceptically.  Harry sighed. "My life tends get bit peculiar."  "Would fair say know going trying get there?"  "Entirely fair."  The old lady nodded. "I'm sure lost important problem, young man."  "True, unlike important problems, problem I understand solve wow conversation turning metaphor human existence, I even realise happening now."  The lady eyed Harry appraisingly. "You fine young raven, you? For moment I starting wonder. Well then, general rule, keep turning left, bound keep going down."  That sounded strangely familiar Harry recall he'd heard before. "Um... seem like intelligent person. Or picture intelligent person... anyway, heard mysterious game play once, tell rules?"  "Life," said lady once. "That's one obvious riddles I've ever heard."  Harry blinked. "No," said slowly. "I mean I got actual note everything saying I play game I told rules, someone leaving little slips paper telling many points I've lost violating rules, like minus two point penalty wearing pyjamas. Do know anyone Hogwarts who's crazy enough powerful enough something like that? Besides Dumbledore, I mean?"  The picture lady sighed. "I'm picture, young man. I remember Hogwarts - Hogwarts is. All I tell riddle, answer would game life, make rules ourselves, one awards takes points always you. If riddle reality - I know."  Harry bowed low picture. "Thank you, milady."  The lady curtseyed him. "I wish I could say I'll remember fondness," said, "but I probably remember all. Farewell, Harry Potter."  He bowed reply, started climb nearest flight stairs.  Four left turns later found staring corridor ended, abruptly, tumbled mound large rocks - cave-in, surrounding walls ceiling intact made quite regular castle stones.  "All right," Harry said empty air, "I give up. I'm asking another hint. How I get I need go?"  "A hint! A hint, say?"  The excited voice came painting wall far away, one portrait middle-aged man loudest pink robes Harry ever seen even imagined. In portrait wearing droopy old pointed hat fish (not drawing fish, mind, fish).  "Yes!" Harry said. "A hint! A hint, I say! Only hint, I'm looking specific hint, game I'm playing -"  "Yes, yes! A hint game! You're Harry Potter, you? I'm Cornelion Flubberwalt! I told Erin Consort told Lord Weaselnose told by, I forget really. But message give you! For me! No one's cared in, I know long, maybe ever, I've stuck bloody useless old corridor - hint! I hint! It cost three points! Do want it?"  "Yes! I want it!" Harry aware probably ought keep sarcasm control seem help himself.  "The darkness found green study rooms McGonagall's Transfiguration class! That's hint! And get move on, slower sack snails! Minus ten points slow! Now 61 points! That rest message!"  "Thank you," Harry said. He really getting behind game here. "Um... I suppose know message originally came from, you?"  "It spoken hollow voice belled forth gap within air itself, gap opened upon fiery abyss! That's told me!"  Harry longer sure, point, whether sort thing ought sceptical about, sort thing take stride. "And I find line green study rooms Transfiguration class?"  "Just spin back around go left, right, down, down, right, left, right, up, left again, green study room go walk straight opposite side big curvy corridor goes intersection right side intersection long straight hallway goes Transfiguration classroom!" The figure middle-aged man paused. "At least that's I Hogwarts. This Monday odd-numbered year, it?"  "Pencil mechanical paper," Harry said pouch. "Er, cancel that, paper mechanical pencil." He looked up. "Could repeat that?"  After getting lost another two times, Harry felt beginning understand basic rule navigating ever-changing maze Hogwarts, namely, ask painting directions. If reflected sort incredibly deep life lesson figure was.  The green study room surprisingly pleasant space sunlight streaming windows green-stained glass showed dragons calm, pastoral scenes. It chairs looked extremely comfortable, tables seemed well-suited studying company one three friends.  Harry actually walk straight door side. There bookshelves set wall, go read titles, lose claim Verres family name. But quickly, mindful complaint slow, went side.  He walking "big curvy corridor" heard young boy's voice cry out.  At times like this, Harry excuse sprint all-out regards saving energy proper warmup exercises worrying crashing things, sudden frantic flight nearly came equally sudden halt almost ran group six first-year Hufflepuffs...  ...who huddled together, looking rather scared like desperately wanted something figure what, probably something group five older Slytherins seemed surrounding another young boy.  Harry suddenly rather angry.  "Excuse me!" shouted Harry top lungs.  It might necessary. People already looking him. But certainly served stop action cold.  Harry walked past cluster Hufflepuffs towards Slytherins.  They looked expressions ranged anger amusement delight.  Part Harry's brain screaming panic much older bigger boys could stomp flat.  Another part said dryly anyone caught seriously stomping Boy-Who-Lived whole world trouble, especially pack older Slytherins seven Hufflepuffs saw it, chance permanent damage presence witnesses nearly zero. The real weapon older boys fear, allowed that.  Then Harry saw boy trapped Neville Longbottom.  Of course.  That settled it. Harry decided apologise humbly Neville meant Neville his, dare they?  Harry reached grabbed Neville wrist yanked Slytherins, boy stumbling shock Harry pulled nearly motion pushed way gap.  And Harry stood center Slytherins Neville stood, looking much older, larger, stronger boys.  "Hello," Harry said. "I'm Boy-Who-Lived."  There rather awkward pause. No one seemed know conversation supposed go there.  Harry's eyes dropped downwards saw books papers scattered around floor. Oh, old game let boy try pick books knock hand again. Harry remember ever object game himself, good imagination imagination making furious. Well, larger situation resolved would easy enough Neville come back pick materials, provided Slytherins stayed intent think anything books.  Unfortunately straying eyes noted. "Ooh," said largest boys, "did 'oo want widdle books -"  "Shut up," Harry said coldly. Keep balance. Don't expect. Don't fall pattern calls bully you. "Is part incredibly clever plan gain future advantage, pointless disgrace name Salazar Slytherin -"  The largest boy shoved Harry Potter hard, went sprawling circle Slytherins onto hard stone floor Hogwarts.  And Slytherins laughed.  Harry rose seemed like terribly slow motion. He know yet use wand, reason let stop him, circumstances.  "I'd like pay many points takes get rid person," Harry said, pointing finger largest Slytherin.  Then Harry lifted hand, said "Abracadabra," snapped fingers.  At word Abracadabra two Hufflepuffs screamed, including Neville, three Slytherins leapt desperately way Harry's finger, largest Slytherin staggered back expression shock, sudden splash red decorating face neck chest.  Harry expecting that.  Slowly, largest Slytherin reached head, peeled pan cherry pie draped him. The largest Slytherin held pan hand moment, staring it, dropped floor.  It probably best time world one Hufflepuffs start laughing, exactly one Hufflepuffs doing.  Then Harry caught sight note bottom pan.  "Hold on," Harry said, darted forward pick note. "This note's me, I think -"  "You," growled largest Slytherin, "you, are, going, -"  "Look this!" shouted Harry, brandishing note older Slytherin. "I mean, look this! Can believe I'm charged 30 points shipping handling one lousy pie? 30 points! I'm turning loss deal even rescuing innocent boy distress! And storage fees? Conveyance charges? Drayage costs? How get drayage costs pie?"  There another one awkward pauses. Harry thought deadly thoughts whichever Hufflepuff seem stop giggling, idiot going get hurt.  Harry stepped back shot Slytherins best lethal glare. "Now go away I keep making existence more surreal do. Let warn you... messing life tends make life... little hairy. Get it?"  In single terrible motion, largest Slytherin whipped wand point Harry instant hit side head another pie, one bright blueberry.  The note pie rather large clearly readable. "You might want read note pie," Harry observed. "I think time."  The Slytherin slowly reached up, took pie pan, turned wet glop dropped blueberry floor, read note said:  WARNING   NO MAGIC MAY BE USED ON THE CONTESTANT   WHILE THE GAME IS IN PROGRESS   FURTHER INTERFERENCE IN THE GAME   WILL BE REPORTED TO THE GAME AUTHORITIES  The expression sheer bafflement Slytherin's face look art. Harry thought might starting like Game Controller.  "Look," Harry said, "you want call day? I think things spiralling control here. How go back Slytherin I go back Ravenclaw cool bit, okay?"  "I've got better idea," hissed largest Slytherin. "How accidentally break fingers?"  "How Merlin's name stage believable accident making threat front dozen witnesses, idiot -"  The largest Slytherin slowly, deliberately reached towards Harry's hands, Harry froze place, part brain noticing boy's age strength finally managing make heard, screaming, WHAT THE HECK AM I DOING?  "Wait!" said one Slytherins, voice suddenly panicky. "Stop, actually that!"  The largest Slytherin ignored him, taking Harry's right hand firmly left hand, taking Harry's index finger right hand.  Harry stared Slytherin straight eyes. Part Harry screaming, supposed happen, allowed happen, grownups would never let something like actually happen -  Slowly, Slytherin started bend index finger backwards.  He actually broken finger beneath much flinch does. Until then, another attempt cause fear.  "Stop!" said Slytherin objected before. "Stop, bad idea!"  "I rather agree," said icy voice. An older woman's voice.  The largest Slytherin let go Harry's hand jumped backwards burned.  "Professor Sprout!" cried one Hufflepuffs, sounding glad anyone Harry ever heard life.  Into Harry's field vision, turned, stalked dumpy little woman messily curled grey hair clothes covered dirt. She pointed accusing finger Slytherins. "Explain yourselves," said. "What Hufflepuffs and..." looked him. "My fine student, Harry Potter."  Uh oh. That's right, HER class I missed morning.  "He threatened kill us!" blurted one Slytherins, one who'd called halt.  "What?" Harry said blankly. "I not! If I going kill I make public threats first!"  A third Slytherin laughed helplessly stopped abruptly boys shot deadly glares.  Professor Sprout adopted rather sceptical expression. "What death threat would be, exactly?"  "The Killing Curse! He pretended use Killing Curse us!"  Professor Sprout turned look Harry. "Yes, quite terrible threat eleven-year-old boy. Though still something ever dream pretending, Harry Potter."  "I even know words Killing Curse," Harry said promptly. "And I wand time."  Now Professor Sprout giving Harry sceptical look. "I suppose boy hit two pies, then."  "He use wand!" blurted one young Hufflepuffs. "I know either, snapped fingers pie!"  "Really," said Professor Sprout pause. She drew wand. "I require it, since seem victim here, would mind I checked wand verify that?"  Harry took wand. "What I -"  "Prior Incantato," said Sprout. She frowned. "That's odd, wand seem used all."  Harry shrugged. "It hasn't, actually, I got wand schoolbooks days ago."  Sprout nodded. "Then clear case accidental magic boy felt threatened. And rules plainly state held responsible. As you..." turned Slytherins. Her eyes dropped deliberately Neville's books lying floor.  There long silence looked five Slytherins.  "Three points Slytherin, each," said finally. "And six him," pointing boy covered pie. "Don't ever meddle Hufflepuffs again, student Harry Potter either. Now go."  She repeat herself; Slytherins turned walked away quickly.  Neville went started picking books. He seemed crying, little. It might delayed shock, might boys helping him.  "Thank much, Harry Potter," Professor Sprout said him. "Seven points Ravenclaw, one Hufflepuff helped protect. And I say anything more."  Harry blinked. He'd expecting something along lines lecture keeping trouble, rather severe scolding missing first class.  Maybe gone Hufflepuff. Sprout cool.  "Scourgify," Sprout said mess pie floor, promptly vanished.  And left, walking along hall led green study room.  "How that?" hissed one Hufflepuff boys soon gone.  Harry smiled smugly. "I make anything I want happen snapping fingers."  The boy's eyes widened. "Really?"  "No," said Harry. "But telling everyone story sure share Hermione Granger first-year Ravenclaw, anecdote might find amusing." He absolutely clue happening, pass opportunity add growing legend. "Oh, Killing Curse?"  The boy gave strange look. "You really know?"  "If I did, I asking."  "The words Killing Curse are," boy swallowed, voice dropped whisper, held hands away sides make clear holding wand, "Avada Kedavra."  Well course are.  Harry put growing list things never ever tell Dad, Professor Michael Verres-Evans. It bad enough talking person survive fearsome Killing Curse, without admit Killing Curse "Abracadabra."  "I see," Harry said pause. "Well, that's last time I ever say snapping fingers." Though produced effect might tactically useful.  "Why -"  "Raised Muggles, Muggles think joke funny. Seriously, that's happened. Sorry, remind name?"  "I'm Ernie Macmillan," said Hufflepuff. He held hand, Harry shook it. "Honoured meet you."  Harry executed slight bow. "Pleased meet you, skip honoured thing."  Then boys crowded round sudden flood introductions.  When done, Harry swallowed. This going difficult. "Um... everyone would excuse me... I something say Neville -"  All eyes turned Neville, took step back, face looking apprehensive.  "I suppose," Neville said tiny voice, "you're going say I braver -"  "Oh, no, nothing like that!" Harry said hastily. "Nothing that. It's just, um, something Sorting Hat told -"  Suddenly boys looked interested, except Neville, looking even apprehensive.  There seemed something blocking Harry's throat. He knew blurt out, like he'd swallowed large brick stuck way.  It like Harry manually take control lips produce syllable individually, managed make happen. "I'm, sor, ry." He exhaled took deep breath. "For I did, um, day. You... gracious anything, I'll understand hate me. This trying look cool apologising accept it. What I wrong."  There pause.  Neville clutched books tighter chest. "Why it?" said thin, wavering voice. He blinked, trying hold back tears. "Why everyone me, even Boy-Who-Lived?"  Harry suddenly felt smaller ever life. "I'm sorry," Harry said again, voice hoarsened. "It's just... looked scared, like sign head saying 'victim', I wanted show things always turn badly, sometimes monsters give chocolate... I thought I showed that, might realise much afraid -"  "But is," whispered Neville. "You saw today, is!"  "They done anything really bad front witnesses. Their main weapon fear. That's target you, see afraid. I wanted make less afraid... show fear worse thing itself... I told myself, Sorting Hat told I lying I really fun. So that's I'm apologising -"  "You hurt me," said Neville. "Just now. When grabbed pulled away them." Neville held arm pointed Harry grabbed him. "I might bruise later hard pulled. You hurt worse anything Slytherins bumping me, actually."  "Neville!" hissed Ernie. "He trying save you!"  "I'm sorry," whispered Harry. "When I saw I got... really angry..."  Neville looked steadily. "So yanked really hard put I went, 'Hello, I'm Boy-Who-Lived'."  Harry nodded.  "I think going really cool someday," Neville said. "But right now, not."  Harry swallowed sudden knot throat walked away. He continued corridor intersection, turned left hallway kept walking, blindly.  What supposed here? Never get angry? He sure could done anything without angry knows would happened Neville books then. Besides, Harry read enough fantasy books know one went. He would try suppress anger would fail would keep coming again. And whole long journey self-discovery would learn end anger part accepting could learn use wisely. Star Wars universe answer actually supposed cut completely negative emotions, something Yoda always made Harry hate little green moron.  So obvious time-saving plan skip journey self-discovery go straight part realised accepting anger part could stay control it.  The problem feel control angry. The cold rage made feel like control. It looked back events whole seemed have... blown control, somehow.  He wondered much Game Controller cared sort thing, whether he'd lost points it. Harry felt like he'd lost quite points, sure old lady picture would told opinion mattered.  And Harry also wondering whether Game Controller sent Professor Sprout. It logical thought: note threatened notify Game Authorities, Professor Sprout was. Maybe Professor Sprout Game Controller - Head House Hufflepuff would last person anyone would suspect, ought put near top Harry's list. He'd read one two mystery novels, too.  "So I game?" Harry said loud.  A sheet paper flew head, someone thrown behind - Harry turned around, one - Harry turned forwards again, note settling floor.  The note said:  POINTS FOR STYLE: 10   POINTS FOR GOOD THINKING: -3,000,000   RAVENCLAW HOUSE POINTS BONUS: 70   CURRENT POINTS: -2,999,871   TURNS REMAINING: 2  "Minus three million points?" Harry said indignantly empty hallway. "That seems excessive! I want file appeal Game Authorities! And I supposed make three million points next two turns?"  Another note flew head.  APPEAL: FAILED   ASKING THE WRONG QUESTIONS: -1,000,000,000,000 POINTS   CURRENT POINTS: -1,000,002,999,871   TURNS REMAINING: 1  Harry gave up. With one turn remaining could take best shot, even good. "My guess game represents life."  A final sheet paper flew head, reading:  ATTEMPT FAILED   FAILED FAILED FAILED   AIIIIIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEEE   CURRENT POINTS: MINUS INFINITY   YOU HAVE LOST THE GAME  FINAL INSTRUCTION:   go Professor McGonagall's office  The last line handwriting.  Harry stared last line while, shrugged. Fine. Professor McGonagall's office would be. If Game Controller...  Okay, honestly, Harry absolutely idea would feel Professor McGonagall Game Controller. His mind drawing complete blank. It was, literally, unimaginable.  A couple portraits later - long trip, Professor McGonagall's office far Transfiguration classroom, least Mondays odd-numbered years - Harry stood outside door office.  He knocked.  "Come in," said Professor McGonagall's muffled voice.  He entered.   Chapter 14: The Unknown Unknowable  Melenkurion abatha! Duroc minas mill J. K. Rowling!   There mysterious questions, mysterious answer contradiction terms.   "Come in," said Professor McGonagall's muffled voice.  Harry so.  The office Deputy Headmistress clean well-organised; wall immediately adjacent desk maze wooden cubbyholes shapes sizes, several parchment scrolls thrust them, somehow clear Professor McGonagall knew exactly every cubbyhole meant, even one else did. A single parchment lay actual desk, was, aside that, clean. Behind desk closed door barred several locks.  Professor McGonagall sitting backless stool behind desk, looking puzzled - eyes widened, perhaps slight note apprehension, saw Harry.  "Mr. Potter?" said Professor McGonagall. "What about?"  Harry's mind went blank. He'd instructed game come here, expecting something mind...  "Mr. Potter?" said Professor McGonagall, starting look slightly annoyed.  Thankfully, Harry's panicking brain remembered point something he'd planning discuss Professor McGonagall. Something important well worth time.  "Um..." Harry said. "If spells cast make sure one's listening us..."  Professor McGonagall stood chair, firmly closed outer door, began taking wand saying spells.  It point Harry realised faced priceless possibly irreplaceable opportunity offer Professor McGonagall Comed-Tea believe seriously thinking would fine soda would vanish seconds told part shut up.  It did, Harry began organise mentally going say. He planned discussion quite soon, long here...  Professor McGonagall finished spell sounded lot older Latin, sat again.  "All right," said quiet voice. "No one's listening." Her face rather tight.  Oh, right, expecting blackmail information prophecy.   Eh, Harry'd get around day.  "It's Incident Sorting Hat," Harry said. (Professor McGonagall blinked.) "Um... I think there's extra spell Sorting Hat, something Sorting Hat know about, something triggers Sorting Hat says Slytherin. I heard message I'm pretty sure Ravenclaws supposed hear. It came moment Sorting Hat head I felt connection break. It sounded like hiss like English time," sharp intake breath McGonagall, "and said: Salutations Slytherin Slytherin, would seek secrets, speak snake."  Professor McGonagall sat mouth open, staring Harry he'd grown another two heads.  "So..." Professor McGonagall said slowly, though believe words coming lips, "you decided come right away tell it."  "Well, yes, course," Harry said. There need admit long taken actually think that. "As opposed to, say, trying research myself, telling children."  "I... see," Professor McGonagall said. "And if, perhaps, discover entrance Salazar Slytherin's legendary Chamber Secrets, entrance alone could open..."  "I would close entrance report team experienced magical archaeologists could assembled," Harry said promptly. "Then I would open entrance would go carefully make sure nothing dangerous. I might go later look around, needed open something else, would area declared clear photographs everything looked people started tromping around priceless historical site."  Professor McGonagall sat mouth open, staring like he'd turned cat.  "It's obvious Gryffindor," Harry said kindly.  "I think," Professor McGonagall said rather choked voice, "that far underestimate rarity common sense, Mr. Potter."  That sounded right. Although... "A Hufflepuff would've said thing."  McGonagall paused, struck. "That's true."  "Sorting Hat offered Hufflepuff."  She blinked though believe ears. "Did really?"  "Yes."  "Mr. Potter," McGonagall said, voice low, "five decades ago last time student died within walls Hogwarts, I certain five decades ago last time someone heard message."  A chill went Harry. "Then I sure take action whatsoever matter without consulting you, Professor McGonagall." He paused. "And may I suggest get together best people find see possible get extra spell Sorting Hat... can't that, maybe put another spell, Quietus briefly activates Hat removed student's head, might work patch. There, dead students." Harry nodded satisfaction.  Professor McGonagall looked even stunned, thing imaginable. "I cannot possibly award enough points without giving House Cup Ravenclaw outright."  "Um," Harry said. "Um. I'd rather earn many House points."  Now Professor McGonagall giving strange look. "Why not?"  Harry little difficulty putting words. "Because would sad, know? Like... like back I still trying go school Muggle world, whenever group project, I'd go ahead whole thing others would slow down. I'm fine earning lots points, anyone else even, I earn enough decisive winning House Cup myself, like I'm carrying House Ravenclaw back that's sad."  "I see..." McGonagall said hesitantly. It apparent way thinking never occurred her. "Suppose I awarded fifty points, then?"  Harry shook head again. "It's fair children I earn lots points grownup things I part can't. How Terry Boot supposed earn fifty points reporting whisper heard Sorting Hat? It fair all."  "I see Sorting Hat offered Hufflepuff," said Professor McGonagall. She eyeing strange respect.  That made Harry choke bit. He'd honestly thought worthy Hufflepuff. That Sorting Hat trying shove anywhere Ravenclaw, House whose virtues have...  Professor McGonagall smiling now. "And I tried give ten points...?"  "Are going explain ten points came from, anyone asks? There might lot Slytherins, I mean children Hogwarts, would really really angry knew spell taken Sorting Hat found I involved. So I think absolute secrecy better part valour. No need thank me, ma'am, virtue reward."  "So is," Professor McGonagall said, "but I special something else give you. I see I greatly wronged thoughts, Mr. Potter. Please wait here."  She got up, went locked back door, waved wand, sort blurry curtain sprang around her. Harry could neither see hear going on. It minutes later blur vanished Professor McGonagall standing there, facing him, door behind looking though ever opened.  And Professor McGonagall held one hand necklace, thin golden chain bearing center silver circle, within device hourglass. In hand folded pamphlet. "This you," said.  Wow! He going get sort neat magical item quest reward! Apparently business refusing offers monetary rewards got magic item actually worked real life, computer games.  Harry accepted new necklace, smiling. "What it?"  Professor McGonagall took breath. "Mr. Potter, item ordinarily lent children already shown highly responsible, order help difficult class schedules." McGonagall hesitated, though add something else. "I must emphasise, Mr. Potter, item's true nature secret must tell students it, let see using it. If that's acceptable you, give back now."  "I keep secrets," Harry said. "So do?"  "So far students concerned, Spimster wicket used treat rare, non-contagious magical ailment called Spontaneous Duplication. You wear clothes, reason show anyone, also reason treat awful secret. Spimster wickets interesting. Do understand, Mr. Potter?"  Harry nodded, smile widening. He sensed work competent Slytherin. "And really do?"  "It's Time-Turner. Each spin hourglass sends one hour back time. So use go back two hours every day, always able get sleep time."  Harry's suspension disbelief blew completely window.  You're giving time machine treat sleep disorder.  You're giving TIME MACHINE treat SLEEP DISORDER.  YOU'RE GIVING ME A TIME MACHINE IN ORDER TO TREAT MY SLEEP DISORDER.  "Ehehehehhheheh..." Harry's mouth said. He holding necklace away though live bomb. Well, no, live bomb, begin describe severity situation. Harry held necklace away though time machine.  Say, Professor McGonagall, know time-reversed ordinary matter looks like antimatter? Why yes does! Did know one kilogram antimatter encountering one kilogram matter annihilate explosion equivalent 43 million tons TNT? Do realise I weigh 41 kilograms resulting blast would leave A GIANT SMOKING CRATER WHERE THERE USED TO BE SCOTLAND?  "Excuse me," Harry managed say, "but sounds really really really REALLY DANGEROUS!" Harry's voice quite rise shriek, possibly scream loud enough situation justice point trying.  Professor McGonagall looked upon tolerant affection. "I'm glad taking seriously, Mr. Potter, Time-Turners dangerous. We give children were."  "Really," Harry said. "Ahahahaha. Of course give time machines children dangerous, I thinking? So clear, sneezing device send Middle Ages I run Gutenberg horse cart prevent Enlightenment? Because, know, I hate happens me."  McGonagall's lips twitching way trying smile. She offered Harry pamphlet holding, Harry carefully holding necklace hands staring hourglass make sure turn. "Don't worry," McGonagall said momentary pause, became clear Harry going move, "that can't possibly happen, Mr. Potter. The Time-Turner cannot used move six hours backwards. It can't used six times day."  "Oh, good, good, that. And someone bumps Time-Turner break trap whole castle Hogwarts endlessly repeating loop Thursdays."  "Well, fragile..." said McGonagall. "And I think I've heard strange things happening they're broken. But nothing like that!"  "Perhaps," Harry said could speak again, "you ought provide time machines sort protective shell, rather leaving glass exposed, prevent happening."  McGonagall looked quite struck. "That's excellent idea, Mr. Potter. I shall inform Ministry it."  That's it, official now, they've ratified Parliament, everyone wizarding world completely stupid.  "And I hate get PHILOSOPHICAL," Harry desperately tried lower voice something shriek, "has anyone thought IMPLICATIONS going back six hours something changes time would pretty much DELETE ALL THE PEOPLE AFFECTED REPLACE THEM WITH DIFFERENT VERSIONS -"  "Oh, can't change time!" Professor McGonagall interrupted. "Good heavens, Mr. Potter, think would allowed students possible? What someone tried change test scores?"  Harry took moment process this. His hands relaxed, little, white grip hourglass chain. Like holding time machine, live nuclear warhead.  "So..." Harry said slowly. "People find universe... happens self-consistent, somehow, even though time-travel it. If I future self interact I'll see thing me, even though, first run through, future self already acting full knowledge things that, perspective, happened yet..." Harry's voice trailed inadequacy English.  "Correct, I think," said Professor McGonagall. "Although wizards advised avoid seen past selves. If attending two classes time need cross paths yourself, example, first version step aside close eyes known time - watch already, good - future pass. It's pamphlet."  "Ahahahaa. And happens someone ignores advice?"  Professor McGonagall pursed lips. "I understand quite disconcerting."  "And doesn't, say, create paradox destroys universe."  She smiled tolerantly. "Mr. Potter, I think I'd remember hearing ever happened."  "THAT IS NOT REASSURING! HAVEN'T YOU PEOPLE EVER HEARD OF THE ANTHROPIC PRINCIPLE? AND WHAT IDIOT EVER BUILT ONE OF THESE THINGS FOR THE FIRST TIME?"  Professor McGonagall actually laughed. It pleasant, glad sound seemed surprisingly place stern face. "You're another 'you turned cat' moment, you, Mr. Potter. You probably want hear this, quite endearingly cute."  "Turning cat even BEGIN compare this. You know right moment I awful suppressed thought somewhere back mind remaining answer whole universe computer simulation like book Simulacron 3 even ruled little toy ISN'T TURING COMPUTABLE! A Turing machine could simulate going back defined moment past computing different future there, oracle machine could rely halting behavior lower-order machines, saying reality somehow self-consistently computes one sweep using information hasn't... happened... yet..."  Realisation struck Harry pile-driver blow.  It made sense now. It finally made sense.  "SO THAT'S HOW THE COMED-TEA WORKS! Of course! The spell force funny events happen, makes feel impulse drink right funny things going happen anyway! I'm fool, I realised I felt impulse drink Comed-Tea Dumbledore's second speech, drink it, choked saliva instead - drinking Comed-Tea cause comedy, comedy causes drink Comed-Tea! I saw two events correlated assumed Comed-Tea cause comedy effect I thought temporal order restrained causation causal graphs acyclic BUT IT ALL MAKES SENSE ONCE YOU DRAW THE CAUSAL ARROWS GOING BACKWARDS IN TIME!"  Realisation struck Harry second pile-driver.  This one managed keep quiet, making small strangling sound like dying kitten realised who'd put note bed morning.  Professor McGonagall's eyes alight. "After graduate, possibly even before, really must teach Muggle theories Hogwarts, Mr. Potter. They sound quite fascinating, even they're wrong."  "Glehhahhh..."  Professor McGonagall offered pleasantries, demanded promises Harry nodded, said something talking snakes anyone could hear him, reminded read pamphlet, somehow Harry found standing outside office door closed firmly behind him.  "Gaahhhrrrraa..." Harry said.  Why yes mind blown.  Not least fact that, Prank, might well never obtained Time-Turner first place.  Or would Professor McGonagall given anyway, later day, whenever got around asking sleep disorder telling Sorting Hat's message? And would he, time, wanted pull prank would led getting Time-Turner earlier? So self-consistent possibility one Prank started even woke morning...?  Harry found considering, first time life, answer question might literally inconceivable. That since brain contained neurons ran forwards time, nothing brain could do, operation could perform, conjugate operation Time Turner.  Up point Harry lived admonition E. T. Jaynes ignorant phenomenon, fact state mind, fact phenomenon itself; uncertainty fact you, fact whatever uncertain about; ignorance existed mind, reality; blank map correspond blank territory. There mysterious questions, mysterious answer contradiction terms. A phenomenon could mysterious particular person, could phenomena mysterious themselves. To worship sacred mystery worship ignorance.  So Harry looked upon magic refused intimidated. People sense history, learned chemistry biology astronomy thought matters always proper meat science, never mysterious. The stars mysteries. Lord Kelvin called nature life biology - response muscles human generation trees seeds - mystery "infinitely beyond" reach science. (Not little beyond, mind you, infinitely beyond. Lord Kelvin certainly felt huge emotional charge knowing something.) Every mystery ever solved puzzle dawn human species right someone solved it.  Now, first time, prospect mystery threatening permanent. If Time work acyclic causal networks Harry understand meant cause effect; Harry understand causes effects understand sort stuff reality might made instead; entirely possible human mind never could understand, brain made old-fashioned linear-time neurons, turned impoverished subset reality.  On plus side, Comed-Tea, seemed all-powerful all-unbelievable, turned much simpler explanation. Which he'd missed merely truth completely outside hypothesis space anything brain evolved comprehend. But actually figured it, probably. Which sort encouraging. Sort of.  Harry glanced watch. It nearly 11AM, he'd gotten sleep last night 1AM, natural state affairs he'd go sleep tonight 3AM. So go sleep 10PM wake 7AM, go back five hours total. Which meant wanted get back dorm around 6AM, anyone awake, he'd better hurry and...  Even retrospect Harry understand he'd pulled half stuff involved Prank. Where pie come from?  Harry starting seriously fear time travel.  On hand, admit irreplaceable opportunity. A prank could pull lifetime, within six hours first found Time-Turners.  In fact even puzzling, Harry thought it. Time presented finished Prank fait accompli, yet was, quite clearly, handiwork. Concept execution writing style. Every last part, even ones still understand.  Well, time a-wasting thirty hours day. Harry know do, might figure rest, like pie, working. There point putting off. He exactly accomplish anything stuck future.   Five hours earlier, Harry sneaking dorm robes pulled head thin sort disguise, case someone already saw time Harry lying bed. He want to explain anyone little medical problem Spontaneous Duplication.  Fortunately seemed everyone still asleep.  And also seemed box, wrapped red green paper bright golden ribbon, lying next bed. The perfect, stereotypical image Christmas present, although Christmas.  Harry crept softly could manage, case someone Quieter turned low.  There envelope attached box, closed plain clear wax without seal impressed.  Harry carefully pried envelope open, took letter inside.  The letter said:  This Cloak Invisibility Ignotus Peverell, passed descendants Potters. Unlike lesser cloaks spells power keep hidden, merely invisible. Your father lent to study shortly died, I confess I received much good use years.  In future I shall get along Disillusionment, I fear. It time Cloak returned you, heir. I thought make Christmas present, wished come back hand then. It seems expect need it. Use well.  No doubt already thinking manner wonderful pranks, father committed day. If full misdeeds known, every woman Gryffindor would gather desecrate grave. I shall try stop history repeating, MOST careful reveal yourself. If Dumbledore saw chance possess one Deathly Hallows, would never let escape grasp day died.  A Very Merry Christmas you.  The note unsigned.   "Hold on," Harry said, pulling short boys leave Ravenclaw dorm. "Sorry, there's something else I've got trunk. I'll along breakfast couple minutes."  Terry Boot scowled Harry. "You'd better planning go things."  Harry held one hand. "I swear I intend nothing sort things, I intend access objects I own, I pranking otherwise questionable intentions towards you, I anticipate intentions changing I get breakfast Great Hall."  Terry frowned. "Wait, -"  "Don't worry," said Penelope Clearwater, guide them. "There loopholes. Well-worded, Potter, lawyer."  Harry Potter blinked that. Ah, yes, Ravenclaw prefect. "Thank you," said. "I think."  "When try find Great Hall, get lost." Penelope stated tones flat, unarguable fact. "As soon do, ask portrait get first floor. Ask another portrait instant suspect might lost again. Especially seems like going higher higher. If higher whole castle ought be, stop wait search parties. Otherwise shall see four months later five months older dressed loincloth covered snow that's stay inside castle."  "Understood," said Harry, swallowing hard. "Um, tell students sort stuff right away?"  Penelope sighed. "What, it? That would take weeks. You'll pick go along." She turned go, followed students. "If I see breakfast thirty minutes, Potter, I'll start search."  Once everyone gone, Harry attached note bed - he'd already written notes, working cavern level everyone else woke up. Then carefully reached inside Quietus field pulled Cloak Invisibility Harry-1's still-sleeping form.  And sake mischief, Harry put Cloak Harry-1's pouch, knowing would thereby already own.   "I see message passed Cornelion Flubberwalt," said painting man aristocratic airs and, fact, perfectly normal nose. "But might I ask came originally?"  Harry shrugged artful helplessness. "I told spoken hollow voice belled forth gap within air itself, gap opened upon fiery abyss."   "Hey!" Hermione said tones indignation place side breakfast table. "That's everyone's dessert! You can't take one whole pie put pouch!"  "I'm taking one pie, I'm taking two. Sorry everyone, gotta run now!" Harry ignored cries outrage left Great Hall. He needed arrive Herbology class little early.   Professor Sprout eyed sharply. "And know Slytherins planning?"  "I can't name source," Harry said. "In fact I ask pretend conversation never happened. Just act like happened across naturally errand, something. I'll run ahead soon Herbology gets out. I think I distract Slytherins get there. I'm easy scare bully, I think they'll dare seriously hurt Boy-Who-Lived. Though... I'm asking run hallways, I would appreciate dawdle along way."  Professor Sprout looked long moment, expression softened. "Please careful yourself, Harry Potter. And... thank you."  "Just sure late," Harry said. "And remember, get there, expecting see conversation never happened."   It horrible, watching yank Neville circle Slytherins. Neville right, he'd used much force, way much force.  "Hello," Harry Potter said coldly. "I'm Boy-Who-Lived."  Eight first-year boys, mostly height. One scar forehead acting like others.  Oh wad power giftie gie us   To see oursel's others see us!   It wad frae monie blunder free us,   And foolish notion -  Professor McGonagall right. The Sorting Hat right. It clear saw outside.  There something wrong Harry Potter.   Chapter 15: Conscientiousness  Love thou Rowling.  Today's historical tidbit: The ancient Hebrews considered boundary day sunset rather dawn, said "evening morning" "morning evening". (And many reviewers noted, modern Jewish halacha asserts same.)   "I'm sure I'll find time somewhere."   "Frigideiro!"  Harry dipped finger glass water desk. It cool. But lukewarm was, lukewarm stayed. Again.  Harry feeling very, cheated.  There hundreds fantasy novels scattered around Verres household. Harry read quite few. And starting look like mysterious dark side. So glass water refused cooperate first times, Harry glanced around Charms classroom make sure one watching, taken deep breath, concentrated, made angry. Thought Slytherins bullying Neville, game someone knocked books every time tried pick again. Thought Draco Malfoy said ten-year-old Lovegood girl Wizengamot really operated...  And fury entered blood, held wand hand trembled hate said cold tones "Frigideiro!" absolutely nothing happened.  Harry gypped. He wanted write someone demand refund dark side clearly ought irresistible magical power turned defective.  "Frigideiro!" said Hermione desk next him. Her water solid ice white crystals forming rim glass. She seemed totally intent work conscious students staring hateful eyes, either (a) dangerously oblivious (b) perfectly honed performance rising level fine art.  "Oh, good, Miss Granger!" squeaked Filius Flitwick, Charms Professor Head Ravenclaw, tiny little man visible signs past dueling champion. "Excellent! Stupendous!"  Harry expected be, worst case, second behind Hermione. Harry would preferred rivalling him, course, could accepted way around.  As Monday, Harry headed bottom class, position companionably rivalling Muggle-raised students except Hermione. Who alone rivalless top, poor thing.  Professor Flitwick standing desk one Muggleborns quietly adjusting way holding wand.  Harry looked Hermione. He swallowed hard. It obvious role scheme things... "Hermione?" Harry said tentatively. "Do idea I might wrong?"  Hermione's eyes lit terrible light helpfulness something back Harry's brain screamed desperate humiliation.  Five minutes later, Harry's water seem noticeably cooler room temperature Hermione given verbal pats head told pronounce carefully next time gone help someone else.  Professor Flitwick given House point helping him.  Harry gritting teeth hard jaw ached helping pronunciation.  I care unfair competition. I know exactly I two extra hours every day. I going sit trunk study I keeping Hermione Granger.   "Transfiguration complex dangerous magic learn Hogwarts," said Professor McGonagall. There trace levity upon face stern old witch. "Anyone messing around class leave come back. You warned."  Her wand came tapped desk, smoothly reshaped pig. A couple Muggleborn students gave small yelps. The pig looked around snorted, seeming confused, became desk again.  The Transfiguration Professor looked around classroom, eyes settled one student.  "Mr. Potter," said Professor McGonagall. "You received schoolbooks days ago. Have started reading Transfiguration textbook?"  "No, sorry professor," Harry said.  "You apologise, Mr. Potter, required read ahead would told so." McGonagall's fingers rapped desk front her. "Mr. Potter, would care guess whether desk I Transfigured pig, began pig I briefly removed Transfiguration? If read first chapter textbook, would know."  Harry's eyebrows furrowed slightly. "I'd guess it'd easier start pig, since started desk, might know stand up."  Professor McGonagall shook head. "No fault you, Mr. Potter, correct answer Transfiguration care guess. Wrong answers marked extreme severity, questions left blank marked great leniency. You must learn know know. If I ask question, matter obvious elementary, answer 'I'm sure', I hold anyone laughs lose House points. Can tell rule exists, Mr. Potter?"  Because single error Transfiguration incredibly dangerous. "No."  "Correct. Transfiguration dangerous Apparition, taught sixth year. Unfortunately, Transfiguration must learned practised young age maximise adult ability. So dangerous subject, quite scared making mistakes, none students ever permanently injured I extremely put first class spoil record."  Several students gulped.  Professor McGonagall stood moved wall behind desk, held white wooden board. "There many reasons Transfiguration dangerous, one reason stands rest." She produced marker seemingly thin air, sketched letters bright red; underlined, using marker, blue:  TRANSFIGURATION IS NOT PERMANENT!  "Transfiguration permanent!" said Professor McGonagall. "Transfiguration permanent! Transfiguration permanent! Mr. Potter, suppose student Transfigured block wood cup water, drank it. What imagine might happen Transfiguration wore off?" There pause. "Excuse me, I asked you, Mr. Potter, I forgot blessed unusually pessimistic imagination -"  "I'm fine," Harry said, swallowing hard. "So first answer I know," Professor nodded approvingly, "but I imagine might be... wood stomach, bloodstream, water gotten absorbed body's tissues - would wood pulp solid wood or..." Harry's grasp magic failed him. He understand wood mapped water first place, understand would happen water molecules scrambled ordinary thermal motions magic wore mapping reversed.  McGonagall's face stiff. "As Mr. Potter correctly reasoned, would become extremely sick require immediate Flooing St. Mungo's Hospital chance survival. Please turn textbooks page 5."  Even without sound moving picture, could tell woman horribly discolored skin screaming.  "The criminal originally Transfigured gold wine gave woman drink, 'in payment debt' put it, received sentence ten years Azkaban. Please turn page 6. That Dementor. They guardians Azkaban. They suck away magic, life, happy thoughts try have. The picture page 7 criminal ten years later, release. You note dead - yes, Mr. Potter?"  "Professor," Harry said, "if worst happens case like that, way maintaining Transfiguration?"  "No," Professor McGonagall said flatly. "Sustaining Transfiguration constant drain magic scales size target form. And would need recontact target every hours, is, case like this, impossible. Disasters like unrecoverable!"  Professor McGonagall leaned forwards, face hard. "You absolutely never circumstances Transfigure anything liquid gas. No water, air. Nothing like water, nothing like air. Even meant drink. Liquid evaporates, little bits pieces get air. You Transfigure anything burned. It make smoke someone could breathe smoke! You never Transfigure anything could conceivably go inside anyone's body means. No food. Nothing looks like food. Not even funny little prank mean tell mud pie actually eat it. You never it. Period. Inside classroom anywhere. Is well understood every single student?"  "Yes," said Harry, Hermione, others. The rest seemed speechless.  "Is well understood every single student?"  "Yes," said muttered whispered.  "If break rules study Transfiguration stay Hogwarts. Repeat along me. I never Transfigure anything liquid gas."  "I never Transfigure anything liquid gas," said students ragged chorus.  "Again! Louder! I never Transfigure anything liquid gas."  "I never Transfigure anything liquid gas."  "I never Transfigure anything looks like food anything else goes inside human body."  "I never Transfigure anything burned could make smoke."  "You never Transfigure anything looks like money, including Muggle money," said Professor McGonagall. "The goblins ways finding it. As matter recognised law, goblin nation permanent state war magical counterfeiters. They send Aurors. They send army."  "I never Transfigure anything looks like money," repeated students.  "And all," said Professor McGonagall, "you Transfigure living subject, especially yourselves. It make sick possibly dead, depending Transfigure long maintain change." Professor McGonagall paused. "Mr. Potter currently holding hand seen Animagus transformation - specifically, human transforming cat back again. But Animagus transformation free Transfiguration."  Professor McGonagall took small piece wood pocket. With tap wand became glass ball. Then said "Crystferrium!" glass ball became steel ball. She tapped wand one last time steel ball became piece wood more. "Crystferrium transforms subject solid glass similarly shaped target solid steel. It cannot reverse, transform desk pig. The general form Transfiguration - free Transfiguration, learning - capable transforming subject target, least far physical form concerned. For reason, free Transfiguration must done wordlessly. Using Charms would require different words every different transformation subject target."  Professor McGonagall gave students sharp look. "Some teachers begin Transfiguration Charms move free Transfiguration afterwards. Yes, would much easier beginning. But set poor mold impairs abilities later. Here learn free Transfiguration start, requires cast spell wordlessly, holding subject form, target form, transformation within mind."  "And answer Mr. Potter's question," Professor McGonagall went on, "it free Transfiguration must never living subject. There Charms potions safely, reversibly transform living subjects limited ways. An Animagus missing limb still missing limb transforming, example. Free Transfiguration safe. Your body change Transfigured - breathing, example, results constant loss body's stuff surrounding air. When Transfiguration wears body tries revert original form, quite able so. If press wand body imagine golden hair, afterwards hair fall out. If visualise someone clearer skin, taking long stay St. Mungo's. And Transfigure adult bodily form, then, Transfiguration wears off, die."  That explained seen things fat boys, girls less perfectly pretty. Or old people, matter. That happen could Transfigure every morning... Harry raised hand tried signal Professor McGonagall eyes.  "Yes, Mr. Potter?"  "Is possible Transfigure living subject target static, coin - no, excuse me, I'm terribly sorry, let's say steel ball."  Professor McGonagall shook head. "Mr. Potter, even inanimate objects undergo small internal changes time. There would visible changes body afterwards, first minute, would notice nothing wrong. But hour would sick, day would dead."  "Erm, excuse me, I'd read first chapter I could guessed desk originally desk pig," Harry said, "but I made assumption want kill pig, might seem highly probable -"  "I foresee marking tests endless source delight me, Mr. Potter. But questions I please ask wait class?"  "No questions, professor."  "Now repeat me," said Professor McGonagall. "I never try Transfigure living subject, especially myself, unless specifically instructed using specialised Charm potion."  "If I sure whether Transfiguration safe, I try I asked Professor McGonagall Professor Flitwick Professor Snape Headmaster, recognised authorities Transfiguration Hogwarts. Asking another student acceptable, even say remember asking question."  "Even current Defence Professor Hogwarts tells Transfiguration safe, even I see Defence Professor nothing bad seems happen, I try myself."  "I absolute right refuse perform Transfiguration I feel slightest bit nervous. Since even Headmaster Hogwarts order otherwise, I certainly accept order Defence Professor, even Defence Professor threatens deduct one hundred House points expelled."  "If I break rules I study Transfiguration time Hogwarts."  "We repeat rules start every class first month," said Professor McGonagall. "And now, begin matches subjects needles targets... put away wands, thank you, 'begin' I meant begin taking notes."  Half hour end class, Professor McGonagall handed matches.  At end class Hermione silvery-looking match entire rest class, Muggleborn otherwise, exactly they'd started with.  Professor McGonagall awarded another point Ravenclaw.   After Transfiguration class dismissed, Hermione came Harry's desk Harry putting away books pouch.  "You know," Hermione said innocent expression face, "I earned two points Ravenclaw today."  "So did," Harry said shortly.  "But good seven points," said. "I guess I'm intelligent you."  Harry finished feeding homework pouch turned Hermione eyes narrowed. He'd actually forgotten that.  She batted eyelashes him. "We lessons every day, though. I wonder long take find Hufflepuffs rescue? Today Monday. So gives Thursday."  The two stared other's eyes, unblinking.  Harry spoke first. "Of course realise means war."  "I know we'd peace."  All students watching fascinated eyes. All students, plus, unfortunately, Professor McGonagall.  "Oh, Mr. Potter," sang Professor McGonagall side room, "I good news you. Madam Pomfrey approved suggestion preventing breakage Spimster wickets, plan finish job end next week. I'd say deserves... let's call ten points Ravenclaw."  Hermione's face gaping betrayal shock. Harry imagined face look much different.  "Professor..." Harry hissed.  "Those ten points unquestionably deserved, Mr. Potter. I would hand House points whim. To might simple matter seeing something fragile suggesting way protect it, Spimster wickets expensive, Headmaster pleased last time one broke." Professor McGonagall looked thoughtful. "My, I wonder student ever earned seventeen House points first day lessons. I'll look up, I suspect that's new record. Perhaps announcement dinnertime?"  "PROFESSOR!" Harry shrieked. "This war! Stop meddling!"  "Now Thursday next week, Mr. Potter. Unless, course, engage sort mischief lose House points then. Addressing professor disrespectfully, example." Professor McGonagall put finger cheek looked reflective. "I expect hit negative numbers end Friday."  Harry's mouth snapped shut. He sent best Death Glare McGonagall seemed find amusing.  "Yes, definitely announcement dinner," Professor McGonagall mused. "But offend Slytherins, announcement brief. Just number points fact record... anyone comes help schoolwork disappointed even started reading textbooks, always refer Miss Granger."  "Professor!" said Hermione rather high-pitched voice.  Professor McGonagall ignored her. "My, I wonder long take Miss Granger something deserving dinnertime announcement? I look forward seeing it, whatever may be."  Harry Hermione, unspoken mutual consent, turned stormed classroom. They followed trail hypnotised Ravenclaws.  "Um," Harry said. "Are still dinner?"  "Of course," said Hermione. "I want fall behind studying."  "Why, thank you. And let say brilliant already, I can't help wonder like elementary training rationality."  "Is really useful? It seem help Charms Transfiguration."  There slight pause.  "Well, I got schoolbooks four days ago. That's I earn seventeen House points without using wand."  "Four days ago? Maybe can't read eight books four days might least read one. How many days take finish rate? You know mathematics, tell what's eight, times four, divided zero?"  "I've got classes now, didn't, weekends free, so... limit eight times four divided epsilon epsilon approaches zero plus... 10:47AM Sunday."  "I three days actually."  "2:47PM Saturday is, then. I'm sure I'll find time somewhere."  And evening morning, first day.   Chapter 16: Lateral Thinking  The enemy's gate Rowling.   I'm psychopath, I'm creative.   As soon walked Defence classroom Wednesday, Harry knew subject going different.  It was, start, largest classroom yet seen Hogwarts, akin major university classroom, layered tiers desks facing gigantic flat stage white marble. The classroom high castle - fifth floor - Harry knew much explanation he'd get room like supposed fit. It becoming clear Hogwarts simply geometry, Euclidean otherwise; connections, directions.  Unlike university hall, rows folding seats; instead quite ordinary Hogwarts wooden desks wooden chairs, lined curve across level classroom. Except desk flat, white, rectangular, mysterious object propped it.  In center gigantic platform, small raised dais darker marble, lone teacher's desk. At Quirrell sat slumped chair, head lolled back, drooling slightly robes.  Now remind of...?  Harry arrived lesson early students yet. (The English language defective came describing time travel; particular, English lacked words capable expressing convenient was.) Quirrell seem be... functional... moment, Harry particularly feel like approaching Quirrell anyway.  Harry selected desk, climbed it, sat down, retrieved Defence textbook. He around seven-eighths way - he'd planned finishing book lesson, actually, running behind schedule already used Time-Turner twice today.  Soon sounds classroom began fill up. Harry ignored them.  "Potter? What here?"  That voice belong here. Harry looked up. "Draco? What oh god minions."  One lads standing behind Draco seemed rather lot muscle eleven-year-old, poised suspiciously balanced-looking stance.  The white-blonde-haired boy smiled rather smugly gestured behind him. "Potter, I introduce Mr. Crabbe," hand moved Muscles Balance, "Mr. Goyle. Vincent, Gregory, Harry Potter."  Mr. Goyle tilted head gave Harry look probably supposed mean something ended looking squinty. Mr. Crabbe said "Please meetcha" tone sounded like trying lower voice far could go.  A fleeting expression consternation crossed Draco's face, quickly replaced superior grin.  "You minions!" Harry repeated. "Where I get minions?"  Draco's smirk grew wider. "I'm afraid, Potter, first step Sorted Slytherin -"  "What? That's fair!"  "- families arrangement born."  Harry looked Mr. Crabbe Mr. Goyle. They seemed trying hard loom. That is, leaning forwards, hunching shoulders, sticking necks staring him.  "Um... hold on," said Harry. "This arranged years ago?"  "Exactly, Potter. I'm afraid luck."  Mr. Goyle produced toothpick began cleaning teeth, still looming.  "And," said Harry, "Lucius insisted grow knowing bodyguards, meet first day school."  That wiped grin Draco's face. "Yes, Potter, know brilliant, whole school knows now, stop showing -"  "So they've told whole lives they're going minions they've spent years imagining minions supposed like -"  Draco winced.  "- what's worse, know they've practising -"  "The boss told ya shut it," rumbled Mr. Crabbe. Mr. Goyle bit toothpick, holding teeth, used one hand crack knuckles other.  "I told front Harry Potter!"  The two looked bit sheepish Mr. Goyle quickly put toothpick back pocket robes.  But moment Draco turned away face Harry again, went back looming.  "I apologise," Draco said stiffly, "for insult imbeciles offered you."  Harry gave meaningful look Mr. Crabbe Mr. Goyle. "I'd say little harsh them, Draco. I think they're acting exactly way I'd want minions act. I mean, I minions."  Draco's jaw dropped.  "Hey, Gregory, don' think he's tryna lure us away boss, ya?"  "I'm sure Mr. Potter foolish."  "Oh, I dream it," Harry said smoothly. "It's something keep mind current employer seems unappreciative. Besides, never hurts offers negotiating working conditions, right?"  "What's doin' Ravenclaw?"  "I can't imagine, Mr. Crabbe."  "Both shut up," Draco said gritted teeth. "That's order." With visible effort, transferred attention Harry again. "Anyway, what're Slytherin Defence class?"  Harry frowned. "Hold on." His hand went pouch. "Timetable." He looked parchment. "Defence, 2:30pm, right it's..." Harry looked mechanical watch, read 11:23. "2:23, unless I've lost track time. Did I?" If had, well, Harry knew get whatever lesson supposed at. God loved Time-Turner someday, old enough, would get married.  "No, sounds right," Draco said, looking puzzled. His gaze turned look rest auditorium, filling green-trimmed robes and...  "Gryffindorks!" spat Draco. "What're here?"  "Hm," Harry said. "Professor Quirrell say... I forget exact words... would ignoring Hogwarts teaching conventions. Maybe combined classes."  "Huh," said Draco. "You're first Ravenclaw here."  "Yup. Got early."  "What're way back row, then?"  Harry blinked. "I dunno, seemed like good place sit?"  Draco made scoffing sound. "You get away teacher tried." The blonde-haired boy leaned slightly closer. "Anyway, true said Derrick crew?"  "Who's Derrick?"  "You hit pie?"  "Two pies, actually. What I supposed said him?"  "That anything cunning ambitious disgrace Salazar Slytherin." Draco staring intently Harry.  "That... sounds right," Harry said. "I think like, 'is kind incredibly clever plot gain future advantage really much disgrace memory Salazar Slytherin looks like' something like that. I remember exact words."  "You're confusing everyone, know," said blonde-haired boy.  "Huh?" Harry said honest confusion.  "Warrington said spending long time Sorting Hat one warning signs major Dark Wizard. Everyone talking it, wondering start sucking case. Then went protected bunch Hufflepuffs, Merlin's sake. Then told Derrick he's disgrace Salazar Slytherin's memory! What's anyone supposed think?"  "That Sorting Hat decided put House 'Slytherin! Just kidding! Ravenclaw!' I've acting accordingly."  Mr. Crabbe Mr. Goyle giggled, causing Mr. Goyle quickly clap hand mouth.  "We'd better go get seats," Draco said. He hesitated, straightened bit, spoke bit fomally. "But I want continue last conversation I accept conditions."  Harry nodded. "Would mind terribly I waited Saturday afternoon? I'm bit contest right now."  "A contest?"  "See I read textbooks fast Hermione Granger did."  "Granger," Draco echoed. His eyes narrowed. "The mudblood thinks Merlin? If trying show Slytherin wishes best luck, Potter, I bother 'til Saturday." Draco inclined head respectfully, wandered off, tailed minions.  Oh, going much fun juggle, I already tell.  The classroom filling rapidly four colors trim: green, red, yellow, blue. Draco two friends seemed midst trying acquire three contiguous front-row seats - already occupied, course. Mr. Crabbe Mr. Goyle looming vigorously, seem much effect.  Harry bent Defence textbook continued reading.   At 2:35PM, seats taken one else seemed coming in, Professor Quirrell gave sudden jerk chair sat straight, face appeared flat, white rectangular objects propped students' desks.  Harry taken surprise, sudden appearance Professor Quirrell's face resemblance Muggle television. There something nostalgic sad that, seemed much like piece home yet really...  "Good afternoon, young apprentices," said Professor Quirrell. His voice seemed come desk screen speaking directly Harry. "Welcome first lesson Battle Magic, founders Hogwarts would put it; or, happens called late twentieth century, Defence Against Dark Arts."  There certain amount frantic scrabbling students, taken surprise, reached parchment notebooks.  "No," Professor Quirrell said. "Don't bother writing subject called. No pointless question count toward marks lessons. That promise."  Many students sat straight that, looking rather shocked.  Professor Quirrell smiling thinly. "Those wasted time reading useless first-year Defence textbooks -"  Someone made choking sound. Harry wondered Hermione.  "- may gotten impression although subject called Defence Against Dark Arts, actually defend Nightmare Butterflies, cause mildly bad dreams, Acid Slugs, dissolve way two-inch wooden beam given day."  Professor Quirrell stood up, shoving chair back desk. The screen Harry's desk followed every move. Professor Quirrell strode towards front classroom, bellowed:  "The Hungarian Horntail taller dozen men! It breathes fire quickly accurately melt Snitch midflight! One Killing Curse bring down!"  There gasps students.  "The Mountain Troll dangerous Hungarian Horntail! It strong enough bite steel! Its hide resistant enough withstand Stunning Hexes Cutting Charms! Its sense smell acute tell afar whether prey part pack, alone vulnerable! Most fearsome all, troll unique among magical creatures continuously maintaining form Transfiguration - always transforming body. If somehow succeed ripping arm grow another within seconds! Fire acid produce scar tissue temporarily confuse troll's regenerative powers - hour two! They smart enough use clubs tools! The mountain troll third perfect killing machine Nature! One Killing Curse bring down."  The students looking rather shocked.  Professor Quirrell smiling rather grimly. "Your sad excuse third-year Defence textbook suggest expose mountain troll sunlight, freeze place. This, young apprentices, sort useless knowledge never find lessons. You encounter mountain trolls open daylight! The idea use sunlight stop result foolish textbook authors trying show mastery minutia expense practicality. Just ridiculously obscure way dealing mountain trolls mean actually try use it! The Killing Curse unblockable, unstoppable, works every single time anything brain. If, adult wizard, find incapable using Killing Curse, simply Apparate away! Likewise facing second perfect killing machine, Dementor. You Apparate away!"  "Unless, course," Professor Quirrell said, voice lower harder, "you influence anti-Apparition jinx. No, exactly one monster threaten fully grown. The single dangerous monster world, dangerous nothing else comes close. The Dark Wizard. That thing still able threaten you."  Professor Quirrell's lips set thin line. "I reluctantly teach enough trivia passing mark Ministry-mandated portions first-year finals. Since exact mark sections make difference future life, anyone wants passing mark welcome waste time studying pathetic excuse textbook. The title subject Defence Against Minor Pests. You learn defend Dark Arts. Which means, let us clear this, defending Dark Wizards. People wands want hurt likely succeed unless hurt first! There defence without offence! There defence without fighting! This reality deemed harsh eleven-year-olds fat, overpaid, Auror-guarded politicians mandated curriculum. To abyss fools! You subject taught Hogwarts eight hundred years! Welcome first year Battle Magic!"  Harry started applauding. He help himself, inspiring.  Once Harry started clapping scattered response Gryffindor, Slytherin, students simply seemed stunned react.  Professor Quirrell made cutting gesture, applause died instantly. "Thank much," said Professor Quirrell. "Now practicalities. I combined first-year Battle classes one, allows offer twice much classroom time Doubles sessions -"  There gasps horror.  "- increased load I make assigning homework."  The gasps horror cut abruptly.  "Yes, heard correctly. I teach fight, write twelve inches fighting due Monday."  Harry desperately wished he'd sat next Hermione could see look face now, hand pretty sure imagining accurately.  Also Harry love. It would three-way wedding: him, Time-Turner, Professor Quirrell.  "For choose, I arranged after-school activities I think find quite interesting well educational. Do want show world abilities instead watching fourteen people play Quidditch? More seven people fight army."  Hot damn.  "These after-school activities also earn Quirrell points. What Quirrell points, ask? The House point system suit needs, makes House points rare. I prefer let students know frequently that. And rare occasions I offer written test, mark go along, get many related questions wrong, test show names students got questions right, students able earn Quirrell points helping you."  ...wow. Why professors use system like that?  "What good Quirrell points, wonder? For start, ten Quirrell points worth one House point. But earn favors well. Would like take exam unusual time? Is particular session would much prefer skip? You find I flexible behalf students accumulated enough Quirrell points. Quirrell points control generalship armies. And Christmas - Christmas break - I grant someone wish. Any school-related feat lies within power, influence, all, ingenuity. Yes, I Slytherin I offering formulate cunning plot behalf, takes accomplish desire. This wish go whoever earned Quirrell points within seven years."  That would Harry.  "Now leave books loose items desks - safe, screens watch - come onto platform. It's time play game called Who's Most Dangerous Student Classroom."   Harry twisted wand right hand said "Ma-ha-su!"  There another high-pitched "bing" floating blue sphere Professor Quirrell assigned Harry target. That particular sound meant perfect strike, Harry gotten nine last ten attempts.  Somewhere Professor Quirrell dug spell incredibly easy pronounce, ridiculously simple wand motion, tendency hit wherever currently looking at. Professor Quirrell disdainfully proclaimed real battle magic far difficult this. That hex entirely useless actual combat. That barely ordered burst magic whose real content aiming, would produce, hit, pain briefly equivalent punched hard nose. That sole purpose test see fast learner, since Professor Quirrell certain one would previously encountered hex anything like it.  Harry care that.  "Ma-ha-su!"  A red bolt energy shot wand struck target blue sphere made bing meant spell actually worked him.  Harry feeling like real wizard first time since he'd come Hogwarts. He wished target would dodge like little spheres Ben Kenobi used training Luke, reason Professor Quirrell instead lined students targets neat orders made sure fire other.  So Harry lowered wand, skipped right, snapped wand twisted shouted "Ma-ha-su!"  There lower-pitched "dong" meant he'd gotten almost right.  Harry put wand pocket, skipped back left drew fired another red bolt energy.  The high-pitched bing resulted easily one satisfying sounds he'd heard life. Harry wanted scream triumph top lungs. I CAN DO MAGIC! FEAR ME, LAWS OF PHYSICS, I'M COMING TO VIOLATE YOU!  "Ma-ha-su!" Harry's voice loud, hardly noticeable steady chant similar cries around classroom platform.  "Enough," said Professor Quirrell's amplified voice. (It sound loud. It sounded like normal volume, coming behind left shoulder, matter standing relative Professor Quirrell.) "I see succeeded least now." The target-spheres turned red began drift towards ceiling.  Professor Quirrell standing raised dais center platform, leaning slightly teacher's desk one hand.  "I told you," Professor Quirrell said, "that would play game called Who's Most Dangerous Student Classroom. There one student classroom mastered Sumerian Simple Strike Hex faster anyone else -"  Oh blah blah blah.  "- went help seven students. For earned first seven Quirrell points awarded year. Come forth, Hermione Granger. It time next stage game."  Hermione Granger began striding forwards, mixed look triumph apprehension face. The Ravenclaws looked proudly, Slytherins glares, Harry frank annoyance. Harry done fine time. He probably even upper half class, everyone faced equally unfamiliar spell Harry read way Adalbert Waffling's Magical Theory. And yet Hermione still better.  Somewhere back mind fear Hermione simply smarter him.  But Harry going pin hopes known facts (a) Hermione read lot standard textbooks (b) Adalbert Waffling uninspired sod who'd written Magical Theory pander school board think much eleven-year-olds.  Hermione reached central dais stepped up.  "Hermione Granger mastered completely unfamiliar spell two minutes, almost full minute faster next runner-up." Professor Quirrell turned slowly place look students watching them. "Could Miss Granger's intelligence make dangerous student classroom? Well? What think?"  No one seemed thinking anything moment. Even Harry sure say.  "Let's find out, shall we?" said Professor Quirrell. He turned back Hermione, gestured toward wider class. "Select student like cast Simple Strike Hex them."  Hermione froze stood.  "Come now," Professor Quirrell said smoothly. "You cast spell perfectly fifty times. It permanently harmful even painful. It hurts much hard punch lasts seconds." Professor Quirrell's voice grew harder. "This direct order professor, Miss Granger. Choose target fire Simple Strike Hex."  Hermione's face screwed horror wand trembling hand. Harry's fingers clenching wand hard sympathy. Even though could see Professor Quirrell trying do. Even though could see point Professor Quirrell trying make.  "If raise wand fire, Miss Granger, lose Quirrell point."  Harry stared Hermione, willing look direction. His right hand softly tapping chest. Pick me, I'm afraid...  Hermione's wand twitched hand; face relaxed, lowered wand side.  "No," said Hermione Granger.  Her voice calm, even though loud, everyone heard silence.  "Then I must deduct one point you," said Professor Quirrell. "This test, failed it."  That reached her. Harry could see it. But kept shoulders straight.  Professor Quirrell's voice sympathetic seemed fill whole room. "Knowing things always enough, Miss Granger. If cannot give receive violence order stubbing toe, cannot defend pass Defence. Please rejoin classmates."  Hermione walked back towards Ravenclaw cluster. Her face looked peaceful Harry, odd reason, wanted start clapping. Even though Professor Quirrell right.  "So," Professor Quirrell said. "It becomes clear Hermione Granger dangerous student classroom. Who think might actually dangerous person here? - besides me, course."  Without even thinking, Harry turned look Slytherin contingent.  "Draco, Noble Most Ancient House Malfoy," said Professor Quirrell. "It seems many fellow pupils looking direction. Come forth, would."  Draco so, walking certain pride bearing. He stepped onto dais looked Professor Quirrell smile.  "Mr. Malfoy," Professor Quirrell said. "Fire."  Harry would tried stop there'd time one smooth motion Draco spun Ravenclaw contingent raised wand said "Mahasu!" like one syllable Hermione saying "Ow!" that.  "Well struck," said Professor Quirrell. "Two Quirrell points you. But tell me, target Miss Granger?"  There pause.  Finally Draco said, "Because stood most."  Professor Quirrell's lips turned thin smile. "And true reason Draco Malfoy dangerous. Had selected other, child would likely resent singled out, Mr. Malfoy would probably make enemy. And Mr. Malfoy might given justification selecting her, would served purpose save alienate you, others already cheering whether says anything not. Which say Mr. Malfoy dangerous knows strike strike, make allies avoid making enemies. Two Quirrell points you, Mr. Malfoy. And demonstrated exemplary virtue Slytherin, I think Salazar's House earned point well. You may rejoin friends."  Draco bowed slightly walked back Slytherin contingent. Some clapping started green-trimmed robes, Professor Quirrell made cutting gesture silence fell again.  "It might seem game done," said Professor Quirrell. "And yet single student classroom dangerous scion Malfoy."  And reason seemed awful lot people looking at...  "Harry Potter. Come forth."  This bode well.  Harry reluctantly walked towards Professor Quirrell stood raised dais, still leaning slightly teacher's desk.  The nervousness put spotlight seemed sharpening Harry's wits approached dais, mind ruffling possibilities Professor Quirrell might think could demonstrate Harry's dangerousness. Would asked cast spell? To defeat Dark Lord?  Demonstrate supposed immunity Killing Curse? Surely Professor Quirrell smart that...  Harry stopped well short dais, Professor Quirrell ask come closer.  "The irony is," said Professor Quirrell, "you looked right person entirely wrong reasons. You thinking," Professor Quirrell's lips twisted, "that Harry Potter defeated Dark Lord, must dangerous. Bah. He one year old. Whatever quirk fate killed Dark Lord likely little Mr. Potter's abilities fighter. But I heard rumors one Ravenclaw facing five older Slytherins, I interviewed several eyewitnesses came conclusion Harry Potter would dangerous student."  A jolt adrenaline poured Harry's system, making stand straighter. He know conclusion Professor Quirrell come to, good.  "Ah, Professor Quirrell -" Harry started say.  Professor Quirrell looked amused. "You're thinking I've come wrong answer, you, Mr. Potter? You learn expect better me." Professor Quirrell straightened leaned desk. "Mr. Potter, things accustomed uses. Give ten unaccustomed uses objects room combat!"  For moment Harry rendered speechless sheer, raw shock understood.  And ideas started pour out.  "There desks heavy enough fatal dropped great height. There chairs metal legs could impale someone driven hard enough. The air classroom would deadly absence, since people die vacuum, serve carrier poison gases."  Harry stop briefly breath, pause Professor Quirrell said:  "That's three. You need ten. The rest class thinks already used whole contents classroom."  "Ha! The floor removed create spike pit fall into, ceiling collapsed someone, walls serve raw material Transfiguration number deadly things - knives, say."  "That's six. But surely scraping bottom barrel now?"  "I even started! Just look people! Having Gryffindor attack enemy ordinary use, course -"  "I count one."  "- blood also used drown someone. Ravenclaws known brains, internal organs could sold black market enough money hire assassin. Slytherins useful assassins, also thrown sufficient velocity crush enemy. And Hufflepuffs, addition hard workers, also contain bones removed, sharpened, used stab someone."  By rest class staring Harry horror. Even Slytherins looked shocked.  "That's ten, though I'm generous counting Ravenclaw one. Now, extra credit, one Quirrell point use objects room yet named." Professor Quirrell favored Harry companionable smile. "The rest class thinks trouble now, since named everything except targets idea may done those."  "Bah! I've named people, robes, used suffocate enemy wrapped around head enough times, Hermione Granger's robes, torn strips tied rope used hang someone, Draco Malfoy's robes, used start fire -"  "Three points," said Professor Quirrell, "no clothing now."  "My wand pushed enemy's brain eye socket" someone made horrified, strangling sound.  "Four points, wands."  "My wristwatch could suffocate someone jammed throat -"  "Five points, enough."  "Hmph," Harry said. "Ten Quirrell points one House point, right? You let keep going I'd House Cup, I even started yet unaccustomed uses everything I've got pockets" mokeskin pouch talk Time-Turner invisibility cloak something could say red spheres...  "Enough, Mr. Potter. Well, think understand makes Mr. Potter dangerous student classroom?"  There low murmur assent.  "Say loud, please. Terry Boot, makes dorm-mate dangerous?"  "Ah... um... he's creative?"  "Wrong!" bellowed Professor Quirrell, fist came sharply desk amplified sound made everyone jump. "All Mr. Potter's ideas worse useless!"  Harry started surprise.  "Remove floor create spike trap? Ridiculous! In combat sort preparation time would hundred better uses! Transfigure material walls? Mr. Potter cannot perform Transfiguration! Mr. Potter exactly one idea could use immediately, right now, without extensive preparation cooperative enemy magic know. That idea jam wand enemy's eye socket. Which would likely break wand kill opponent! In short, Mr. Potter, I'm afraid proposals uniformly awful."  "What?" Harry said indignantly. "You asked unusual ideas, practical ones! I thinking outside box! How would use something classroom kill someone?"  Professor Quirrell's expression disapproving, smile crinkles around eyes. "Mr. Potter, I never said kill. There time place taking enemy alive, inside Hogwarts classroom usually one places. But answer question, hit neck edge chair."  There laughter Slytherins, laughing Harry, him.  Everyone else looking rather horrified.  "But Mr. Potter demonstrated dangerous student classroom. I asked unaccustomed uses items room combat. Mr. Potter could suggested using desk block curse, using chair trip oncoming enemy, wrapping cloth around arm create improvised shield. Instead, every single use Mr. Potter named offensive rather defensive, either fatal potentially fatal."  What? Wait, true... Harry sudden sense vertigo tried remember exactly he'd suggested, surely counterexample...  "And that," Professor Quirrell said, "is Mr. Potter's ideas strange useless - reach far impractical order meet standard killing enemy. To him, idea fell short worth considering. This reflects quality might call intent kill. I it. Harry Potter it, could stare five older Slytherins. Draco Malfoy it, yet. Mr. Malfoy would hardly shrink talk ordinary murder, even shocked - yes Mr. Malfoy, I watching face - Mr. Potter described use classmates' bodies raw material. There censors inside mind make flinch away thoughts like that. Mr. Potter thinks purely killing enemy, grasp means so, flinch, censors off. Even though youthful genius undisciplined impractical useless, intent kill makes Harry Potter Most Dangerous Student Classroom. One final point - no, let us make point Ravenclaw - indispensable requisite true fighting wizard."  Harry's mouth gaped open speechless shock searched frantically something say this. That completely I about!  But could see students starting believe it. Harry's mind flipping possible denials finding anything could stand authoritative voice Professor Quirrell. The best Harry come "I'm psychopath, I'm creative" sounded kind ominous. He needed say something unexpected, something would make people stop reconsider -  "And now," Professor Quirrell said. "Mr. Potter. Fire."  Nothing happened, course.  "Ah, well," said Professor Quirrell. He sighed. "I suppose must start somewhere. Mr. Potter, select student please Simple Strike Hex. You I dismiss class day. If not, I begin deducting House points, I keep deducting do."  Harry carefully raised wand. He much, Professor Quirrell might start deducting House points right away.  Slowly, though roasting platter, Harry turned face Slytherins.  And Harry's eyes met Draco's.  Draco Malfoy look slightest bit afraid. The blonde-haired boy giving visible sign assent Harry given Hermione, could hardly expected so. The Slytherins would think rather odd.  "Why hesitation?" said Professor Quirrell. "Surely there's one obvious choice."  "Yes," Harry said. "Only one obvious choice."  Harry twisted wand said "Ma-ha-su!"  There complete silence classroom.  Harry shook left arm, trying get rid lingering sting.  There silence.  Finally Professor Quirrell sighed. "Yes, quite ingenious, lesson taught dodged it. One point Ravenclaw showing cleverness expense actual goal. Class dismissed."  And anyone else could say anything, Harry sang out:  "Just kidding! RAVENCLAW!"  There silence brief moment that, sound people thinking, murmurs started rapidly rose roar conversation.  Harry turned towards Professor Quirrell, two needed talk -  Quirrell slumped trudging back chair.  No. Not acceptable. They really needed talk. Stuff zombie act, Professor Quirrell would probably wake Harry poked couple times. Harry started forward -  WRONG   DON'T   BAD IDEA  Harry swayed stopped tracks, feeling dizzy.  And flock Ravenclaws descended discussions began.   Chapter 17: Locating Hypothesis  You always J. K. Rowling.  Historical note: In Roman calendar, "Ides" month referred 15th day March, May, July, October, 13th day months.   "You start see pattern, hear rhythm world."   Thursday.  If wanted specific, 7:24am Thursday morning.  Harry sitting bed, textbook lying limp motionless hands.  Harry idea truly brilliant experimental test.  It would mean waiting extra hour breakfast, cereal bars. No, idea absolutely positively tested right away, immediately, now.  Harry set textbook aside, leapt bed, raced around bed, yanked cavern level trunk, ran stairs, started moving boxes books around. (He really needed unpack get bookcases point middle textbook reading contest Hermione falling behind time.)  Harry found book wanted raced back upstairs.  The boys getting ready go breakfast Great Hall start day.  "Excuse something me?" said Harry. He flipping book's index spoke, found page first ten thousand primes, flipped page, thrust book Anthony Goldstein. "Pick two three-digit numbers list. Don't tell are. Just multiply together tell product. Oh, calculation twice double-check? Please make really sure got right answer, I'm sure what's going happen universe make multiplication error."  It said lot life dorm like past days Anthony even bother saying anything like "Why'd suddenly flip out?" "That seems really weird, reasons asking?" "What mean, sure what's going happen universe?"  Anthony wordlessly accepted book took parchment quill. Harry spun around shut eyes, making sure see anything, dancing back forth bouncing impatience. He got pad paper mechanical pencil got ready write.  "Okay," Anthony said, "One hundred eighty-one thousand, four hundred twenty-nine."  Harry wrote 181,429. He repeated he'd written down, Anthony confirmed it.  Then Harry raced back cavern level trunk, glanced watch (the watch said 4:28 meant 7:28) shut eyes.  Around thirty seconds later, Harry heard sound steps, followed sound cavern level trunk sliding shut. (Harry worried suffocating. An automatic Air-Freshening Charm part got willing buy really good trunk. Wasn't magic wonderful, worry electric bills.)  And Harry opened eyes, saw he'd hoping see, folded piece paper left floor, gift future self.  Call piece paper "Paper-2".  Harry tore piece paper pad.  Call "Paper-1". It was, course, piece paper. You could even see, looked closely, ragged edges matched.  Harry reviewed mind algorithm would follow.  If Harry opened Paper-2 blank, would write "101 x 101" Paper-1, fold up, study hour, go back time, drop Paper-1 (which would thereby become Paper-2), head cavern level join dorm mates breakfast.  If Harry opened Paper-2 two numbers written it, Harry would multiply numbers together.  If product equaled 181,429, Harry would write two numbers Paper-1 send Paper-1 back time.  Otherwise Harry would add 2 number right write new pair numbers Paper-1. Unless made number right greater 997, case Harry would add 2 number left write 101 right.  And Paper-2 said 997 x 997, Harry would leave Paper-1 blank.  Which meant possible stable time loop one Paper-2 contained two prime factors 181,429.  If worked, Harry could use recover sort answer easy check hard find. He shown P=NP Time-Turner, trick general that. Harry could use find combinations combination locks, passwords every sort. Maybe even find entrance Slytherin's Chamber Secrets, Harry could figure systematic way describing locations Hogwarts. It would awesome cheat even Harry's standards cheating.  Harry took Paper-2 trembling hand, unfolded it.  Paper-2 said slightly shaky handwriting:  DO NOT MESS WITH TIME  Harry wrote "DO NOT MESS WITH TIME" Paper-1 slightly shaky handwriting, folded neatly, resolved truly brilliant experiments Time least fifteen years old.  To best Harry's knowledge, scariest experimental result entire history science.  It somewhat difficult Harry focus reading textbook next hour.  That Harry's Thursday started.   Thursday.  If wanted specific, 3:32pm Thursday afternoon.  Harry boys first year outside grassy field Madam Hooch, standing next Hogwarts supply broomsticks. The girls would learning fly separately. Apparently, reason, girls want learn fly broomsticks presence boys.  Harry little wobbly day long. He seem stop wondering particular stable time loop selected was, retrospect, rather large space possibilities.  Also: seriously, broomsticks? He going fly on, basically, line segment? Wasn't pretty much single unstable shape could possibly find, short attempting hold point marble? Who'd selected design flying device, possibilities? Harry hoping figure speech, no, standing front looked world like ordinary wooden kitchen broomsticks. Had someone gotten stuck idea broomsticks failed consider anything else? It be. There way optimal designs cleaning kitchens flying would happen coincide worked scratch.  It clear day bright blue sky brilliant sun begging get eyes make impossible see, trying fly around sky. The ground nice dry, smelling positively baked, somehow felt very, hard Harry's shoes.  Harry kept reminding lowest common denominator eleven-year-olds expected learn hard.  "Stick right hand broom, left hand left-handed," called Madam Hooch. "And say, UP!"  "UP!" everyone shouted.  The broomstick leapt eagerly Harry's hand.  Which put head class, once. Apparently saying "UP!" lot difficult looked, broomsticks rolling around ground trying inch away would-be riders.  (Of course Harry would bet money Hermione done least well came turn try, earlier day. There possibly anything could master first try would baffle Hermione, turned broomstick riding instead anything intellectual, Harry would die.)  It took everyone get broomstick front them. Madam Hooch showed mount walked around field, correcting grips stances. Apparently even among children who'd allowed fly home, taught correctly.  Madam Hooch surveyed field boys, nodded. "Now, I blow whistle, kick ground, hard."  Harry swallowed hard, trying quell queasy feeling stomach.  "Keep brooms steady, rise feet, come straight back leaning forwards slightly. On whistle - three - two -"  One brooms shot skyward, accompanied young boy's screams - horror, delight. The boy spinning awful rate ascended, got glimpses white face -  As though slow motion, Harry leaping back broomstick scrabbling wand, though really know planned it, he'd exactly two sessions Charms last one Hover Charm Harry able cast spell successfully one time three certainly levitate whole people -  If hidden power me, let reveal NOW!  "Come back, boy!" shouted Madam Hooch (which unhelpful instruction imaginable dealing out-of-control broomstick, flying instructor, fully automatic section Harry's brain added Madam Hooch tally fools).  And boy thrown broomstick.  He seemed move slowly air, first.  "Wingardium Leviosa!" screamed Harry.  The spell failed. He could feel fail.  There THUD distant cracking sound, boy lay facedown grass heap.  Harry sheathed wand raced forwards full speed. He arrived boy's side time Madam Hooch, Harry reached pouch tried recall oh god name never mind he'd try "Healer's Pack!" popped hand -  "Broken wrist," Madam Hooch said. "Calm down, boy, broken wrist!"  There sort mental lurch Harry's mind snapped Panic Mode.  The Emergency Healing Pack Plus lay open front him, syringe liquid fire Harry's hand, would kept boy's brain oxygenated he'd managed snap neck.  "Ah..." Harry said rather wavering sort voice. His heart pounding loudly almost hear panting breath. "Broken bone... right... Setting String?"  "That's emergencies only," snapped Madam Hooch. "Put away, he's fine." She leaned boy, offering hand. "Come on, boy, right, get!"  "You're seriously going make ride broomstick again?" Harry said horror.  Madam Hooch sent Harry glare. "Of course not!" She pulled boy feet using good arm - Harry saw shock Neville Longbottom again, him? - turned watching children. "None move I take boy hospital wing! You leave brooms Hogwarts say 'Quidditch.' Come on, dear."  And Madam Hooch walked Neville, clutching wrist trying control sniffles.  When earshot, one Slytherins started giggling.  That set others.  Harry turned looked them. It seemed like good time memorise faces.  And Harry saw Draco strolling towards him, accompanied Mr. Crabbe Mr. Goyle. Mr. Crabbe smiling. Mr. Goyle decidedly was. Draco wearing controlled face twitched occasionally, Harry inferred Draco thought hilarious saw political advantage gained laughing instead Slytherin dungeons afterwards.  "Well, Potter," Draco said low voice carry, still controlled face twitching occasionally, "Just wanted say, take advantage emergencies demonstrate leadership, want look like total control situation, rather than, say, going complete panic." Mr. Goyle giggled, Draco shot quelling look. "But probably scored points anyway. You need help stowing healer's kit?"  Harry turned look Healing Pack, got face turned away Draco. "I think I'm fine," Harry said. He put syringe back place, redid latches, stood up.  Ernie Macmillan arrived Harry feeding pack back mokeskin pouch.  "Thank you, Harry Potter, behalf Hufflepuff," Ernie Macmillan said formally. "It good try good thought."  "A good thought indeed," drawled Draco. "Why anyone Hufflepuff wands out? Maybe helped instead Potter, could've caught him. I thought Hufflepuffs supposed stick together?"  Ernie looked like torn getting angry wanting die shame. "We think time -"  "Ah," said Draco, "didn't think it, I guess that's better one Ravenclaw friend Hufflepuff."  Oh, hell, Harry supposed juggle one... "You're helping," Harry said mild tone. Hoping Draco would interpret interfering plans, please shut up.  "Hey, what's this?" said Mr. Goyle. He stooped grass picked something around size large marble, glass ball seemed filled swirling white mist.  Ernie blinked. "Neville's Remembrall!"  "What's Remembrall?" asked Harry.  "It turns red forgotten something," Ernie said. "It tell forgot, though. Give here, please, I'll hand back Neville later." Ernie held hand.  A sudden grin flashed across Mr. Goyle's face spun around raced away.  Ernie stood still moment surprise, shouted "Hey!" ran Mr. Goyle.  And Mr. Goyle grabbed broomstick, hopped one smooth motion took air.  Harry's jaw dropped. Hadn't Madam Hooch said would get expelled?  "That idiot!" Draco hissed. He opened mouth shout -  "Hey!" shouted Ernie. "That's Neville's! Give back!"  The Slytherins started cheering hooting.  Draco's mouth snapped shut. Harry caught sudden look indecision face.  "Draco," Harry said low tone, "if order idiot back ground, teacher's going get back -"  "Come get it, Hufflepuffle!" shouted Mr. Goyle, great cheer went Slytherins.  "I can't!" whispered Draco. "Everyone Slytherin would think I'm weak!"  "And Mr. Goyle gets expelled," hissed Harry, "your father going think moron!"  Draco's face twisted agony.  At moment -  "Hey, Slytherslime," shouted Ernie, "didn't anyone ever tell Hufflepuffs stick together? Wands out, Hufflepuff!"  And suddenly whole lot wands pointed Mr. Goyle's direction.  Three seconds later -  "Wands out, Slytherin!" said around five different Slytherins.  And whole lot wands pointed Hufflepuff's direction.  Two seconds later -  "Wands out, Gryffindor!"  "Do something, Potter!" whispered Draco. "I can't one stop you! I'll owe favour think something supposed brilliant?"  In around five half seconds, realised Harry, someone going cast Sumerian Simple Strike Hex time teachers done expelling people boys left year would Ravenclaws.  "Wands out, Ravenclaw!" shouted Michael Corner apparently feeling left disaster.  "GREGORY GOYLE!" screamed Harry. "I challenge contest possession Neville's Remembrall!"  There sudden pause.  "Oh, really?" said Draco loudest drawl Harry ever heard. "That sounds interesting. What sort contest, Potter?"  Er...  "Contest" far Harry's inspiration gotten. What sort contest, say "chess" Draco able accept without looking strange, say "arm-wrestling" Mr. Goyle would crush -  "How this?" Harry said loudly. "Gregory Goyle I stand apart other, one else allowed come near either us. We use wands neither anyone else. I move I'm standing, neither he. And I get hands Neville's Remembrall, Gregory Goyle relinquishes claim Remembrall he's holding gives me."  There another pause people's looks relief transmuted confusion.  "Hah, Potter!" said Draco loudly. "I'd like see that! Mr. Goyle accepts!"  "It's on!" said Harry.  "Potter, what?" whispered Draco, somehow without moving lips.  Harry know answer without moving his.  People putting wands away, Mr. Goyle swooped gracefully ground, looking rather confused. Some Hufflepuffs started towards Mr. Goyle, Harry shot desperately pleading look backed off.  Harry walked toward Mr. Goyle stopped paces away, far enough apart reach other.  Slowly, deliberately, Harry sheathed wand.  Everyone else backed away.  Harry swallowed. He knew broad outline wanted do, done way one understood he'd done -  "All right," Harry said loudly. "And now..." He took deep breath raised one hand, fingers ready snap. There gasps anyone who'd heard pies, practically everyone. "I call upon insanity Hogwarts! Happy happy boom boom swamp swamp swamp!" And Harry snapped fingers.  A lot people flinched.  And nothing happened.  Harry let silence stretch while, developing, until...  "Um," someone said. "Is it?"  Harry looked boy who'd spoken. "Look front you. You see patch ground looks barren, without grass it?"  "Um, yeah," said boy, Gryffindor (Dean something?).  "Dig up."  Now Harry getting lot strange looks.  "Er, why?" said Dean something.  "Just it," said Terry Boot weary voice. "No point asking why, trust one."  Dean something kneeled began scoop away dirt.  After minute so, Dean stood again. "There's nothing there," Dean said.  Huh. Harry planning go back time bury treasure map would lead another treasure map would lead Neville's Remembrall would put getting back Mr. Goyle...  Then Harry realised much simpler way threaten secret Time-Turners quite much.  "Thanks, Dean!" Harry said loudly. "Ernie, would look around ground Neville fell see find Neville's Remembrall?"  People looked even confused.  "Just it," said Terry Boot. "He'll keep trying something works, scary thing -"  "Merlin!" gasped Ernie. He holding Neville's Remembrall. "It's here! Right fell!"  "What?" cried Mr. Goyle. He looked saw...  ...that still holding Neville's Remembrall.  There rather long pause.  "Er," said Dean something, "that's possible, it?"  "It's plot hole," said Harry. "I made weird enough distract universe moment forgot Goyle already picked Remembrall."  "No, wait, I mean, that's totally possible -"  "Excuse me, standing around waiting go flying broomsticks? Yes are. So shut up. Anyway, I get hands Neville's Remembrall, contest Gregory Goyle relinquish claim Remembrall he's holding give me. Those terms, remember?" Harry stretched hand beckoned Ernie. "Just roll here, since one's supposed get close me, okay?"  "Hold on!" shouted Slytherin - Blaise Zabini, Harry likely forget name. "How know that's Neville's Remembrall? You could've dropped another Remembrall -"  "The Slytherin strong one," Harry said, smiling. "But word one Ernie's holding Neville's. No comment one Gregory Goyle's holding."  Zabini spun Draco. "Malfoy! You're going let get away -"  "Shut up, you," rumbled Mr. Crabbe, standing behind Draco. "Mr. Malfoy need tell do!"  Good minion.  "My bet Draco, Noble Most Ancient House Malfoy," Harry said. "Not you, Zabini. I done Mr. Malfoy said he'd like see do, judgment bet, I leave Mr. Malfoy." Harry inclined head towards Draco raised eyebrows slightly. That ought allow Draco save enough face.  There pause.  "You promise actually Neville's Remembrall?" Draco said.  "Yes," Harry said. "That's one go back Neville originally. And one Gregory Goyle's holding goes me."  Draco nodded, looking decisive. "I question word Noble House Potter, then, matter strange was. And Noble Most Ancient House Malfoy keeps word well. Mr. Goyle, give Mr. Potter -"  "Hey!" Zabini said. "He yet, got hands -"  "Catch, Harry!" said Ernie, tossed Remembrall.  Harry easily snapped Remembrall air, he'd always good reflexes way. "There," said Harry, "I win..."  Harry trailed off. All conversation stopped.  The Remembrall glowing bright red hand, blazing like miniature sun cast shadows ground broad daylight.   Thursday.  If wanted specific, 5:09pm Thursday afternoon, Professor McGonagall's office, flying classes. (With extra hour Harry slipped between.)  Professor McGonagall sitting stool. Harry hot seat front desk.  "Professor," Harry said tightly, "Slytherin pointing wands Hufflepuff, Gryffindor pointing wands Slytherin, idiot called wands Ravenclaw, I maybe five seconds keep whole thing blowing sky-high! It I could think of!"  Professor McGonagall's face pinched angry. "You use Time-Turner fashion, Mr. Potter! Is concept secrecy something understand?"  "They know I it! They think I really weird things snapping fingers! I've done weird stuff can't done Time-Turners even, I'll stuff like that, case even stand out! I it, Professor!"  "You it!" snapped Professor McGonagall. "All needed get anonymous Slytherin back ground wands put away! You could challenged game Exploding Snap no, use Time-Turner flagrant unnecessary manner!"  "It I could think of! I even know Exploding Snap is, accepted game chess I'd picked arm-wresting I would lost!"  "Then picked wrestling!"  Harry blinked. "But I'd lost -"  Harry stopped.  Professor McGonagall looking angry.  "I'm sorry, Professor McGonagall," Harry said small voice. "I honestly think that, right, I have, would brilliant I had, I think all..."  Harry's voice trailed off. It suddenly apparent he'd lot options. He could asked Draco suggest something, could asked crowd... use Time-Turner flagrant unnecessary. There giant space possibilities, picked one?  Because he'd seen way win. Win possession unimportant trinket teachers would've taken back Mr. Goyle anyway.  Intent win. That gotten him.  "I'm sorry," Harry said again. "For pride stupidity."  Professor McGonagall wiped hand across forehead. Some anger seemed dissipate. But voice still came hard. "One display like that, Mr. Potter, returning Time-Turner. Do I make clear?"  "Yes," Harry said. "I understand I'm sorry."  "Then, Mr. Potter, allowed retain Time-Turner now. And considering size debacle did, fact, avert, I deduct points Ravenclaw."  Plus explain deducted points. But Harry dumb enough say loud.  "More importantly, Remembrall go like that?" Harry said. "Does mean I've Obliviated?"  "That puzzles well," Professor McGonagall said slowly. "If simple, I would think courts would use Remembralls, not. I shall look it, Mr. Potter." She sighed. "You go now."  Harry started get chair, halted. "Um, sorry, I something else I wanted tell -"  You could hardly see flinch. "What it, Mr. Potter?"  "It's Professor Quirrell -"  "I'm sure, Mr. Potter, nothing importance." Professor McGonagall spoke words great rush. "Surely heard Headmaster tell students bother us unimportant complaints Defence Professor?"  Harry rather confused. "But could important, yesterday I got sudden sense doom -"  "Mr. Potter! I sense doom well! And sense doom suggesting must finish sentence!"  Harry's mouth gaped open. Professor McGonagall succeeded; Harry speechless.  "Mr. Potter," said Professor McGonagall, "if discovered anything seems interesting Professor Quirrell, please feel free share anyone else. Now I think taken enough valuable time -"  "This like you!" Harry burst out. "I'm sorry seems unbelievably irresponsible! From I've heard there's kind jinx Defence position, already know something's going go wrong, I'd think toes -"  "Go wrong, Mr. Potter? I certainly hope not." Professor McGonagall's face expressionless. "After Professor Blake caught closet fewer three fifth-year Slytherins last February, year that, Professor Summers failed completely educator students thought boggart kind furniture, would catastrophic problem extraordinarily competent Professor Quirrell came attention now, I daresay students would fail Defence O.W.L.s N.E.W.T.s."  "I see," Harry said slowly, taking in. "So words, whatever's wrong Professor Quirrell, desperately want know end school year. And since currently September, could assassinate Prime Minister live television get away far concerned."  Professor McGonagall gazed unblinkingly. "I certain I could never heard endorsing statement, Mr. Potter. At Hogwarts strive proactive respect anything threatens educational attainment students."  Such first-year Ravenclaws can't keep mouths shut. "I believe I understand completely, Professor McGonagall."  "Oh, I doubt that, Mr. Potter. I doubt much." Professor McGonagall leaned forward, face tightening again. "Since I already discussed matters far sensitive these, I shall speak frankly. You, alone, reported mysterious sense doom. You, alone, chaos magnet likes I never seen. After little shopping trip Diagon Alley, Sorting Hat, today's little episode, I well foresee I fated sit Headmaster's office hear hilarious tale Professor Quirrell alone play starring role, choice fire him. I already resigned it, Mr. Potter. And sad event takes place earlier Ides May, I string gates Hogwarts intestines pour fire beetles nose. Now understand completely?"  Harry nodded, eyes wide. Then, second, "What I get I make happen last day school year?"  "Get office!"   Thursday.  There must something Thursdays Hogwarts.  It 5:32pm Thursday afternoon, Harry standing next Professor Flitwick, front great stone gargoyle guarded entrance Headmaster's office.  No sooner made back Professor McGonagall's office Ravenclaw study rooms one students told report Professor Flitwick's office, Harry learned Dumbledore wanted speak him.  Harry, feeling rather apprehensive, asked Professor Flitwick Headmaster said about.  Professor Flitwick shrugged helpless sort way.  Apparently Dumbledore said Harry far young invoke words power madness.  Happy happy boom boom swamp swamp swamp? Harry thought said aloud.  "Please worry much, Mr. Potter," squeaked Professor Flitwick somewhere around Harry's shoulder level. (Harry grateful Professor Flitwick's gigantic puffy beard, hard getting used Professor shorter spoke higher-pitched voice.) "Headmaster Dumbledore may seem little odd, lot odd, even extremely odd, never hurt student slightest, I believe ever will." Professor Flitwick gave Harry encouraging smile. "Just keep mind times sure panic!"  This helping.  "Good luck!" squeaked Professor Flitwick, leaned gargoyle said something Harry somehow failed hear all. (Of course, password much good could hear someone saying it.) And stone gargoyle walked aside natural ordinary movement Harry found rather shocking, since gargoyle still looked like solid, immovable stone whole time.  Behind gargoyle set slowly revolving spiral stairs. There something disturbingly hypnotic it, even disturbing revolving spiral ought take anywhere.  "Up go!" squeaked Flitwick.  Harry rather nervously stepped onto spiral, found himself, reason brain seem visualise all, moving upwards.  The gargoyle thudded back place behind him, spiral stairs kept turning Harry kept higher up, rather dizzying time, Harry found front oak door brass griffin knocker.  Harry reached turned doorknob.  The door swung open.  And Harry saw interesting room he'd ever seen life.  There tiny metal mechanisms whirred ticked slowly changed shape emitted little puffs smoke. There dozens mysterious fluids dozens oddly shaped containers, bubbling, boiling, oozing, changing color, forming interesting shapes vanished half second saw them. There things looked like clocks many hands, inscribed numbers unrecognisable languages. There bracelet bearing lenticular crystal sparkled thousand colors, bird perched atop golden platform, wooden cup filled looked like blood, statue falcon encrusted black enamel. The wall hung pictures people sleeping, Sorting Hat casually poised hatrack also holding two umbrellas three red slippers left feet.  In midst chaos clean black oaken desk. Before desk oaken stool. And behind desk well-cushioned throne containing Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, adorned long silver beard, hat like squashed giant mushroom, looked Muggle eyes like three layers bright pink pyjamas.  Dumbledore smiling, bright eyes twinkled mad intensity.  With trepidation, Harry seated front desk. The door swung shut behind loud thunk.  "Hello, Harry," said Dumbledore.  "Hello, Headmaster," Harry replied. So first-name basis? Would Dumbledore say call -  "Please, Harry!" said Dumbledore. "Headmaster sounds formal. Just call Heh short."  "I'll sure to, Heh," said Harry.  There slight pause.  "Do know," said Dumbledore, "you're first person who's ever taken that?"  "Ah..." Harry said. He tried control voice despite sudden sinking feeling stomach. "I'm sorry, I, ah, Headmaster, told I -"  "Heh, please!" said Dumbledore cheerfully. "And there's call worried, I launch window make one mistake. I'll give plenty warnings first, something wrong! Besides, matters people talk you, think you."  He's never hurt student, keep remembering sure panic.  Dumbledore drew forth small metal case flipped open, showing small yellow lumps. "Sherbet lemon?" said Headmaster.  "Er, thank you, Heh," said Harry. Does slipping student LSD count hurting them, fall category harmless fun? "You, um, said something young invoke words power madness?"  "That certainly are!" Dumbledore said. "Thankfully Words Power Madness lost seven centuries ago one slightest idea anymore. It little remark."  "Ah..." Harry said. He aware mouth hanging open. "Why call here, then?"  "Why?" Dumbledore repeated. "Ah, Harry, I went around day asking I things, I'd never time get single thing done! I'm quite busy person, know."  Harry nodded, smiling. "Yes, impressive list. Headmaster Hogwarts, Chief Warlock Wizengamot, Supreme Mugwump International Confederation Wizards. Sorry ask I wondering, possible get six hours use one Time-Turner? Because pretty impressive thirty hours day."  There another slight pause, Harry went smiling. He little apprehensive, actually lot apprehensive, become clear Dumbledore deliberately messing him, something within absolutely refused sit take like defenceless lump.  "I'm afraid Time like stretched much," said Dumbledore slight pause, "and yet seem little large it, constant struggle fit lives Time."  "Indeed," Harry said grave solemnity. "That's best come points quickly."  For moment Harry wondered he'd gone far.  Then Dumbledore chuckled. "Straight point shall be." The Headmaster leaned forwards, tilting squashed mushroom hat brushing beard desk. "Harry, Monday something impossible even Time-Turner. Or rather, impossible Time-Turner. Where two pies come from, I wonder?"  A jolt adrenaline shot Harry. He'd done using Cloak Invisibility, one given Christmas box along note, note said: If Dumbledore saw chance possess one Deathly Hallows would never let escape grasp....  "A natural thought," Dumbledore went on, "is since none first-years present able cast spell, someone else present, yet unseen. And one could see them, why, would easy enough throw pies. One might suspect since Time-Turner, invisible one; since spell Disillusionment far beyond current abilities, invisibility cloak." Dumbledore smiled conspiratorially. "Am I right track far, Harry?"  Harry frozen. He feeling outright lie would wise, possibly least bit helpful, think anything else say.  Dumbledore waved friendly hand. "Don't worry, Harry, done anything wrong. Invisibility cloaks rules - I suppose they're rare enough one ever got around putting list. But really I wondering something else entirely."  "Oh?" Harry said normal voice could manage.  Dumbledore's eyes shone enthusiasm. "You see, Harry, adventures tend catch hang things. You start see pattern, hear rhythm world. You begin harbour suspicions moment revelation. You Boy-Who-Lived, somehow invisibility cloak made way hands four days discovered magical Britain. Such cloaks sale Diagon Alley, one might find way destined wearer. And I cannot help wonder strange chance found invisibility cloak, Cloak Invisibility, one three Deathly Hallows reputed hide wearer gaze Death himself." Dumbledore's gaze bright eager. "May I see it, Harry?"  Harry swallowed. There full flood adrenaline system entirely useless, powerful wizard world way could make door nowhere Hogwarts hide did, lose Cloak passed Potters knew long -  Slowly Dumbledore leaned back high chair. The bright light gone eyes, looked puzzled little sorrowful. "Harry," said Dumbledore, "if want to, say no."  "I can?" Harry croaked.  "Yes, Harry," said Dumbledore. His voice sounded sad now, worried. "It seems afraid me, Harry. May I ask I've done earn distrust?"  Harry swallowed. "Is way swear binding magical oath take cloak?"  Dumbledore shook head slowly. "Unbreakable Vows used lightly. And besides, Harry, already know spell, would word spell binding. Yet surely realise I need permission see Cloak. I powerful enough draw forth myself, mokeskin pouch no." Dumbledore's face grave. "But I do. The Cloak yours, Harry. I seize you. Not even look moment, unless decide show me. That promise oath. Should I need prohibit using school grounds, I require go vault Gringotts store there."  "Ah..." Harry said. He swallowed hard, trying calm flood adrenaline think reasonably. He took mokeskin pouch belt. "If really need permission... it." Harry held pouch Dumbledore, bit hard lip, sending signal case Obliviated afterwards.  The old wizard reached pouch, without saying word retrieval, drew forth Cloak Invisibility.  "Ah," breathed Dumbledore. "I right..." He poured shimmering black velvet mesh hand. "Centuries old, still perfect day made. We lost much art years, I cannot make thing myself, one can. I feel power like echo mind, like song forever sung without anyone hear it..." The wizard looked Cloak. "Do sell it," said, "do give anyone possession. Think twice show anyone, ponder three times reveal Deathly Hallow. Treat respect, indeed Thing Power."  For moment Dumbledore's face grew wistful...  ...and handed Cloak back Harry.  Harry put back pouch.  Dumbledore's face grave more. "May I ask again, Harry, came distrust so?"  Suddenly Harry felt rather ashamed.  "There note Cloak," Harry said small voice. "It said would try take Cloak me, knew. I know left note, though, I really don't."  "I... see," Dumbledore said slowly. "Well, Harry, I impugn motives whoever left note. Who knows may best good intentions? They give Cloak, all."  Harry nodded, impressed Dumbledore's charity, abashed sharp contrast attitude.  The old wizard went on. "But I gamepieces color, I think. The boy finally defeated Voldemort, old man held long enough save day. I hold caution you, Harry, must best wise. I ask think twice ponder three times again, next time someone tells distrust me."  "I'm sorry," Harry said. He felt wretched point, he'd told Gandalf essentially, Dumbledore's kindness making feel worse. "I distrusted you."  "Alas, Harry, world..." The old wizard shook head. "I cannot even say unwise. You know me. And truth Hogwarts would well trust. Perhaps even call friends."  Harry swallowed. That sounded rather ominous. "Like who?"  Dumbledore stood chair, began examining one instruments, dial eight hands varying length.  After moments, old wizard spoke again. "He probably seems quite charming," said Dumbledore. "Polite - least. Well-spoken, maybe even admiring. Always ready helping hand, favour, word advice -"  "Oh, Draco Malfoy!" Harry said, feeling rather relieved Hermione something. "Oh no, no no, got wrong, he's turning me, I'm turning him."  Dumbledore froze peering dial. "You're what?"  "I'm going turn Draco Malfoy Dark Side," Harry said. "You know, make good guy."  Dumbledore straightened turned Harry. He wearing one astonished expressions Harry ever seen anyone, let alone someone long silver beard. "Are certain," said old wizard moment, "that ready redeemed? I fear whatever goodness think see within wishful thinking - worse, lure, bait -"  "Er, likely," Harry said. "I mean he's trying disguise good guy he's incredibly bad it. This question Draco coming charming deciding must hidden core goodness deep down. I selected redemption specifically he's heir House Malfoy pick one person redeem, would obviously him."  Dumbledore's left eye twitched. "You intend sow seeds love kindness Draco Malfoy's heart expect Malfoy's heir prove valuable you?"  "Not me!" Harry said indignantly. "To magical Britain, works out! And he'll happier mentally healthier life himself! Look, I enough time turn everyone away Dark Side I've got ask Light gain advantage fastest -"  Dumbledore started laughing. Laughing lot harder Harry would expect, almost howling. It seemed positively undignified. An ancient powerful wizard ought chuckle deep booming tones, laugh hard gasping breath. Harry literally fallen chair watching Marx Brothers movie Duck Soup, hard Dumbledore laughing now.  "It's funny," Harry said while. He starting worry Dumbledore's sanity again.  Dumbledore got control visible effort. "Ah, Harry, one symptom disease called wisdom begin laughing things one else thinks funny, wise, Harry, start getting jokes!" The old wizard wiped tears away eyes. "Ah, me. Ah, me. Oft evil shall evil mar indeed, deed."  Harry's brain took moment place familiar words... "Hey, that's Tolkien quote! Gandalf says that!"  "Theoden, actually," said Dumbledore.  "You're Muggleborn?" Harry said shock.  "I'm afraid not," said Dumbledore, smiling again. "I born seventy years book published, dear child. But seems Muggleborn students tend think alike certain ways. I accumulated fewer twenty copies The Lord Rings three sets Tolkien's entire collected works, I treasure every one them." Dumbledore drew wand held struck pose. "You cannot pass! How look?"  "Ah," Harry said something approaching complete brain shutdown, "I think missing Balrog." And pink pyjamas squashed mushroom hat helping slightest.  "I see." Dumbledore sighed glumly sheathed wand belt. "I fear precious Balrogs life late. Nowadays meetings Wizengamot I must try desperately prevent work getting done, formal dinners foreign politicians compete see obstinate fool. And mysterious people, knowing things I way knowing, making cryptic statements understood hindsight, small ways powerful wizards amuse left part pattern allows heroes. Speaking which, Harry, I certain something give you, something belonged father."  "You do?" said Harry. "Gosh, would figured."  "Yes indeed," said Dumbledore. "I suppose little predictable, it?" His face turned solemn. "Nonetheless..."  Dumbledore went back desk sat down, pulling one drawers so. He reached using arms, and, straining slightly, pulled rather large heavy-looking object drawer, deposited oaken desk huge thunk.  "This," Dumbledore said, "was father's rock."  Harry stared it. It light gray, discolored, irregularly shaped, sharp-edged, much plain old ordinary large rock. Dumbledore deposited rested widest available cross-section, still wobbled unstably desk.  Harry looked up. "This joke, right?"  "It not," said Dumbledore, shaking head looking serious. "I took ruins James Lily's home Godric's Hollow, also I found you; I kept now, day I could give you."  In mixture hypotheses served Harry's model world, Dumbledore's insanity rapidly rising probability. But still substantial amount probability allocated alternatives... "Um, magical rock?"  "Not far I know," said Dumbledore. "But I advise greatest possible stringency keep close person times."  All right. Dumbledore probably insane wasn't... well, would embarrassing get trouble ignoring advice inscrutable old wizard. That like #4 list Top 100 Obvious Failure Modes.  Harry stepped forward put hands rock, trying find angle lift without cutting himself. "I'll put pouch, then."  Dumbledore frowned. "That may close enough person. And mokeskin pouch lost, stolen?"  "You think I carry big rock everywhere I go?"  Dumbledore gave Harry serious look. "That might prove wise."  "Ah..." Harry said. It looked rather heavy. "I'd think students would tend ask questions that."  "Tell I ordered it," said Dumbledore. "No one question that, since think I'm insane." His face still perfectly serious.  "Er, honest go around ordering students carry large rocks I kind see people would think that."  "Ah, Harry," said Dumbledore. The old wizard gestured, sweep one hand seemed take mysterious instruments around room. "When young believe know everything, believe see explanation something, explanation exists. When older realise whole universe works rhythm reason, even know it. It ignorance appears us insanity."  "Reality always lawful," said Harry, "even know law."  "Precisely, Harry," said Dumbledore. "To understand - I see understand - essence wisdom."  "So... I carry rock exactly?"  "I can't think reason, actually," said Dumbledore.  "...you can't."  Dumbledore nodded. "But I can't think reason mean reason."  The instruments ticked on.  "Okay," said Harry, "I'm even sure I saying this, simply correct way deal admitted ignorance universe works."  "It isn't?" said old wizard, looking surprised disappointed.  Harry feeling conversation going work favour, carried regardless. "No. I even know fallacy official name, I make one myself, would 'privileging hypothesis' something like that. How I put formally... um... suppose million boxes, one boxes contained diamond. And box full diamond-detectors, diamond-detector always went presence diamond, went half time boxes diamond. If ran twenty detectors boxes, have, average, one false candidate one true candidate left. And would take one two detectors left one true candidate. The point lots possible answers, evidence need goes locating true hypothesis millions possibilities - bringing attention first place. The amount evidence need judge two three plausible candidates much smaller comparison. So jump ahead without evidence promote one particular possibility focus attention, skipping work. Like, live city million people, there's murder, detective says, well, we've got evidence all, considered possibility Mortimer Snodgrass it?"  "Did he?" said Dumbledore.  "No," said Harry. "But later turns murderer black hair, Mortimer black hair, everyone's like, ah, looks like Mortimer all. So unfair Mortimer police promote attention without good reasons already hand suspect him. When lots possibilities, work goes locating true answer - starting pay attention it. You need proof, sort official evidence scientists courts demand, need sort hint, hint discriminate particular possibility millions others. Otherwise can't pluck right answer thin air. You can't even pluck possibility worth thinking thin air. And there's got million things I could besides carrying around father's rock. Just I'm ignorant universe mean I'm unsure I reason presence uncertainty. The laws thinking probabilities less iron laws govern old-fashioned logic, allowed." Harry paused. "Unless, course, hint mentioning."  "Ah," said Dumbledore. He tapped cheek, looking thoughtful. "An interesting argument, certainly, break point make analogy million potential murderers one committed murder, taking one many possible courses action, many possible courses action may wise? I say carrying father's rock one best possible course action, wiser not."  Dumbledore reached desk drawer accessed earlier, time seeming root around inside - least arm seemed moving. "I remark," Dumbledore said Harry still trying sort reply completely unexpected rejoinder, "that common misconception Ravenclaws smart children Sorted there, leaving none Houses. This so; Sorted Ravenclaw indicates driven desire know things, quality intelligent." The wizard smiling bent drawer. "Nonetheless, seem rather intelligent. Less like ordinary young hero like young mysterious ancient wizard. I think I may taking wrong approach you, Harry, may able understand things others could grasp. So I shall daring, offer certain heirloom."  "You mean..." gasped Harry. "My father... owned another rock?"  "Excuse me," said Dumbledore, "I still older mysterious revelations made I revealing, thank you... oh, thing!" Dumbledore reached desk drawer, still further. His head shoulders whole torso disappeared inside hips legs sticking out, though desk drawer eating him.  Harry help wonder much stuff complete inventory would look like.  Finally Dumbledore rose back drawer, holding objective search, set desk alongside rock.  It used, ragged-edged, worn-spined textbook: Intermediate Potion Making Libatius Borage. There picture smoking vial cover.  "This," Dumbledore intoned, "was mother's fifth-year Potions textbook."  "Which I carry times," said Harry.  "Which holds terrible secret. A secret whose revelation could prove disastrous I must ask swear - I require swear seriously, Harry, whatever may think - never tell anyone anything else."  Harry considered mother's fifth-year Potions textbook, which, apparently, held terrible secret.  The problem Harry take oaths like seriously. Any vow Unbreakable Vow made right sort person.  And...  "I'm feeling thirsty," Harry said, "and good sign."  Dumbledore entirely failed ask questions cryptic statement. "Do swear, Harry?" said Dumbledore. His eyes gazed intently Harry's. "Otherwise I cannot tell you."  "Yes," said Harry. "I swear." That trouble Ravenclaw. You refuse offer like curiosity would eat alive, everyone else knew it.  "And I swear turn," said Dumbledore, "that I tell truth."  Dumbledore opened book, seemingly random, Harry leaned see.  "Do see notes," Dumbledore said voice low almost whisper, "written margins book?"  Harry squinted slightly. The yellowing pages seemed describing something called potion eagle's splendour, many ingredients items Harry recognise whose names appear derive English. Scrawled margin handwritten annotation saying, I wonder would happen used Thestral blood instead blueberries? immediately beneath reply different handwriting, You'd get sick weeks maybe die.  "I see them," said Harry. "What them?"  Dumbledore pointed second scrawl. "The ones handwriting," said, still low voice, "were written mother. And ones handwriting," moving finger indicate first scrawl, "were written me. I would turn invisible sneak dorm room sleeping. Lily thought one friends writing amazing fights."  That exact point Harry realised Headmaster Hogwarts was, fact, crazy.  Dumbledore looking serious expression. "Do understand implications I told you, Harry?"  "Ehhh..." Harry said. His voice seemed stuck. "Sorry... I... really..."  "Ah well," said Dumbledore, sighed. "I suppose cleverness limits all, then. Shall pretend I say anything?"  Harry rose chair, wearing fixed smile. "Of course," Harry said. "You know actually getting rather late day I'm bit hungry, I going dinner, really" Harry made beeline door.  The doorknob entirely failed turn.  "You wound me, Harry," said Dumbledore's voice quiet tones coming right behind him. "Do least realise I told sign trust?"  Harry slowly turned around.  In front powerful insane wizard long silver beard, hat like squashed giant mushroom, wearing looked Muggle eyes like three layers bright pink pyjamas.  Behind door seem working moment.  Dumbledore looking rather saddened weary, like wanted lean wizard's staff have. "Really," said Dumbledore, "you try anything new instead following pattern every time hundred ten years, people start running away." The old wizard shook head sorrow. "I'd hoped better you, Harry Potter. I'd heard friends also think mad. I know mistaken. Will believe me?"  "Please open door," Harry said, voice trembling. "If ever want trust again, open door."  There sound behind door opening.  "There things I planned say you," Dumbledore said, "and leave now, know were."  Sometimes Harry absolutely hated Ravenclaw.  He's never hurt student, said Harry's Gryffindor side. Just keep remembering sure panic. You're going run away things getting interesting, you?  You can't walk Headmaster! said Hufflepuff part. What starts deducting House points? He could make school life difficult decides like you!  And piece Harry much like quite manage silence pondering potential advantages one friends mad old wizard also happened Headmaster, Chief Warlock, Supreme Mugwump. And unfortunately inner Slytherin seemed much better Draco turning people Dark Side, saying things like poor fellow, looks like needs someone talk to, he? want powerful man end trusting someone less virtuous, would you? I wonder sort incredible secrets Dumbledore could tell if, know, became friends even I bet he's got reaallly interesting book collection.  You're bunch lunatics, Harry thought entire assemblage, he'd unanimously outvoted every component part himself.  Harry turned, took step towards open door, reached out, deliberately closed again. It costless sacrifice given staying anyway, Dumbledore could control movements regardless, maybe would impress Dumbledore.  When Harry turned back around saw powerful insane wizard smiling looking friendly. That good, maybe.  "Please again," Harry said. "I like trapped."  "I sorry that, Harry," said Dumbledore sounded like tones sincere apology. "But would terribly unwise let leave without father's rock."  "Of course," Harry said. "It reasonable expect door open I put quest items inventory."  Dumbledore smiled nodded.  Harry went desk, twisted mokeskin pouch around front belt, and, effort, managed heave rock eleven-year-old arms feed in.  He could actually feel weight slowly diminishing Widening Lip charm ate rock, burp followed rather noisy distinctly complaining sound it.  His mother's fifth-year Potions textbook (which held secret fact pretty terrible) followed shortly after.  And Harry's inner Slytherin made sly suggestion ingratiating Headmaster, which, unfortunately, perfectly pitched way gain support majority Ravenclaw faction.  "So," Harry said. "Um. As long I'm hanging around, I suppose would like give bit tour office? I'm bit curious things are," understatement month September.  Dumbledore gazed him, nodded slight grin. "I'm flattered interest," said Dumbledore, "but I'm afraid much say." Dumbledore took step closer wall pointed painting sleeping man. "These portraits past Headmasters Hogwarts." He turned pointed desk. "This desk." He pointed chair. "This chair -"  "Excuse me," Harry said, "actually I wondering those." Harry pointed small cube softly whispering "blorple... blorple... blorple".  "Oh, little fiddly things?" said Dumbledore. "They came Headmaster's office I absolutely idea do. Although dial eight hands counts number of, let's call sneezes, left-handed witches within borders France, would believe much work took nail down. And one golden wibblers invention Minerva never, ever going figure doing."  Dumbledore took step hatrack Harry still processing this. "Here course Sorting Hat, I believe two met. It told never placed head circumstances. You're fourteenth student history said about, Baba Yaga another one I'll tell twelve older. This umbrella. This another umbrella." Dumbledore took another steps turned around, smiling quite broadly. "And course, people come office want see Fawkes."  Dumbledore standing next bird golden platform.  Harry came over, rather puzzled. "This Fawkes?"  "Fawkes phoenix," said Dumbledore. "Very rare, powerful magical creatures."  "Ah..." Harry said. He lowered head stared tiny, beady black eyes, showed slightest sign power intelligence.  "Ahhh..." Harry said again.  He pretty sure recognised shape bird. It pretty hard miss.  "Umm..."  Say something intelligent! Harry's mind roared itself. Don't stand sounding like gibbering moron!  Well heck I supposed say? Harry's mind fired back.  Anything!  You mean, anything besides "Fawkes chicken" -  Yes! Anything that!  "So, ah, sort magic phoenixes do, then?"  "Their tears power heal," Dumbledore said. "They creatures fire, move places easily fire may extinguish one place kindled another. The tremendous strain innate magic ages bodies quickly, yet close undying creature exists world, whenever bodies fail immolate burst fire leave behind hatchling, sometimes egg." Dumbledore came closer inspected chicken, frowning. "Hm... looking little peaky there, I'd say."  By time statement registered fully Harry's mind, chicken already fire.  The chicken's beak opened, time much single caw began wither char. The blaze brief, intense, entirely self-contained; smell burning.  And fire died seconds begun, leaving behind tiny, pathetic heap ashes golden platform.  "Don't look horrified, Harry!" said Dumbledore. "Fawkes hurt." Dumbledore's hand dipped pocket, hand sifted ashes turned small yellowish egg. "Look, here's egg!"  "Oh... wow... amazing..."  "But really get things," Dumbledore said. Leaving egg behind ashes chicken, returned throne seated himself. "It's almost time dinner, all, want to use Time-Turners."  There violent power struggle going Government Harry. Slytherin Hufflepuff switched sides seeing Headmaster Hogwarts set fire chicken.  "Yes, things," said Harry's lips. "And dinner."  You're sounding like gibbering moron observed Harry's Internal Critic.  "Well," Dumbledore said. "I fear I confession make, Harry. A confession apology."  "Apologies good" even make sense! What I talking about?  The old wizard sighed deeply. "You may still think understanding I say. I'm afraid, Harry, I've manipulating entire life. It I consigned care wicked stepparents -"  "My stepparents wicked!" blurted Harry. "My parents, I mean!"  "They aren't?" Dumbledore said, looking surprised disappointed. "Not even little wicked? That fit pattern..."  Harry's inner Slytherin screamed top mental lungs, SHUT UP YOU IDIOT HE'LL TAKE YOU AWAY FROM THEM!  "No, no," said Harry, lips frozen ghastly grimace, "I trying spare feelings, they're actually wicked..."  "They are?" Dumbledore leaned forward, gazing intently. "What do?"  Talk fast "they, ah, I dishes wash problems let read lot books -"  "Ah, good, that's good hear," said Dumbledore, leaning back again. He smiled sad sort way. "I apologise that, then. Now I? Ah, yes. I'm sorry say, Harry, I responsible virtually everything bad ever happened you. I know probably make angry."  "Yes, I'm angry!" said Harry. "Grrr!"  Harry's Internal Critic promptly awarded All-Time Award Worst Acting History Ever.  "And I wanted know," Dumbledore said, "I wanted tell early possible, case something happens one us later, I truly, truly sorry. For everything already happened, everything will."  Moisture glistened old wizard's eyes.  "And I'm angry!" said Harry. "So angry I want leave right unless got anything else say!"  Just GO sets fire! shrieked Slytherin, Hufflepuff, Gryffindor.  "I understand," said Dumbledore. "One last thing then, Harry. You attempt forbidden door third-floor corridor. There's possible way could get traps, I want hear hurt trying. Why, I doubt could much open first door, since locked know spell Alohomora -"  Harry spun around bolted exit top speed, doorknob turned agreeably hand racing spiral stairs even turned, feet almost stumbling themselves, moment bottom gargoyle walking aside Harry fired stairwell like cannonball.   Harry Potter.  There must something Harry Potter.  It Thursday everyone, all, yet sort thing seem happen anyone else.  It 6:21pm Thursday afternoon Harry Potter, firing stairwell like cannonball accelerating top speed, ran directly Minerva McGonagall turning corner way Headmaster's office.  Thankfully neither much hurt. As explained Harry little earlier day - back refusing go anywhere near broomstick - Quidditch needed solid iron Bludgers stand decent chance injuring players, since wizards tended lot resistant Muggles impacts.  Harry Professor McGonagall end floor, parchments carrying went corridor.  There terrible, terrible pause.  "Harry Potter," breathed Professor McGonagall lying floor right next Harry. Her voice rose nearly shriek. "What Headmaster's office?"  "Nothing!" squeaked Harry.  "Were talking Defence Professor?"  "No! Dumbledore called gave big rock said father's I carry everywhere!"  There another terrible pause.  "I see," said Professor McGonagall, voice little calmer. She stood up, brushed off, glared scattered parchments, jumped neat stack scurried back corridor wall though hide gaze. "My sympathies, Mr. Potter, I apologise doubting you."  "Professor McGonagall," Harry said. His voice wavering. He pushed floor, stood, looked trustworthy, sane face. "Professor McGonagall..."  "Yes, Mr. Potter?"  "Do think I should?" Harry said small voice. "Carry father's rock everywhere?"  Professor McGonagall sighed. "That Headmaster, I'm afraid." She hesitated. "I say ignoring Headmaster completely almost never wise. I sorry hear dilemma, Mr. Potter, there's way I help whatever decide -"  "Um," Harry said. "Actually I thinking I know how, I could Transfigure rock ring wear finger. If could teach sustain Transfiguration -"  "It good asked first," Professor McGonagall said, face growing bit stern. "If lost control Transfiguration reversal would cut finger probably rip hand half. And age, even ring large target sustain indefinitely without serious drain magic. But I ring forged setting jewel, small jewel, contact skin, practice sustaining safe subject, like marshmallow. When kept successfully, even sleep, full month, I allow Transfigure, ah, father's rock..." Professor McGonagall's voice trailed off. "Did Headmaster really -"  "Yes. Ah... um..."  Professor McGonagall sighed. "That's bit strange even him." She stooped picked stack parchments. "I'm sorry this, Mr. Potter. I apologise mistrusting you. But turn see Headmaster."  "Ah... good luck, I guess. Er..."  "Thank you, Mr. Potter."  "Um..."  Professor McGonagall walked gargoyle, inaudibly spoke password, stepped revolving spiral stairs. She began rise sight, gargoyle started back -  "Professor McGonagall Headmaster set fire chicken!"  "He wha-"   Chapter 18: Dominance Hierarchies  Any sufficiently advanced J. K. Rowling indistinguishable magic.   "That sound like sort thing I would do, it?"   It breakfast time Friday morning. Harry took another huge bite toast tried remind brain scarfing breakfast actually get dungeons faster. Anyway full hour study time breakfast start Potions.  But dungeons! In Hogwarts! Harry's imagination already sketching chasms, narrow bridges, torchlit sconces, patches glowing moss. Would rats? Would dragons?  "Harry Potter," said quiet voice behind him.  Harry looked shoulder found beholding Ernie Macmillan, smartly dressed yellow-trimmed robes looking little worried.  "Neville thought I warn you," Ernie said low voice. "I think he's right. Be careful Potions Master session today. The older Hufflepuffs told us Professor Snape really nasty people like, like people Slytherins. If say anything smart it... could really bad you, I've heard. Just keep head give reason notice you."  There pause Harry processed this, lifted eyebrows. (Harry wished could raise one eyebrow, like Spock, he'd never able manage.) "Thanks," Harry said. "You might've saved lot trouble."  Ernie nodded, turned go back Hufflepuff table.  Harry resumed eating toast.  It around four bites afterward someone said "Pardon me," Harry turned around see older Ravenclaw, looking little worried -  Some time later, Harry finishing third plate rashers. (He'd learned eat heavily breakfast. He could always eat lightly lunch end using Time-Turner.) And yet another voice behind saying "Harry?"  "Yes," Harry said wearily, "I'll try draw Professor Snape's attention -"  "Oh, that's hopeless," said Fred.  "Completely hopeless," said George.  "So house elves bake cake," said Fred.  "We're going put one candle every point lose Ravenclaw," said George.  "And party Gryffindor table lunch," said Fred.  "We hope cheer afterward," finished George.  Harry swallowed last bite rasher turned around. "All right," said Harry. "I going ask Professor Binns, I really wasn't, Professor Snape awful fired?"  "Fired?" said Fred.  "You mean, let go?" said George.  "Yes," Harry said. "It's bad teachers. You fire them. Then hire better teacher instead. You unions tenure here, right?"  Fred George frowning much way hunter-gatherer tribal elders might frown tried tell calculus.  "I know," said Fred while. "I never thought that."  "Me neither," said George.  "Yeah," said Harry, "I get lot. See lunch, guys, blame candles cake."  Fred George laughed, Harry said something funny, bowed headed back toward Gryffindor.  Harry turned back breakfast table grabbed cupcake. His stomach already felt full, feeling morning might use lot calories.  As ate cupcake, Harry thought worst teacher he'd met far, Professor Binns History. Professor Binns ghost. From Hermione said ghosts, seem likely fully self-aware. There famous discoveries made ghosts, much original work, matter they'd life. Ghosts tended trouble remembering current century. Hermione said like accidental portraits, impressed surrounding matter burst psychic energy accompanying wizard's sudden death.  Harry run stupid teachers abortive forays standard Muggle education - father lot pickier came selecting grad students tutors, course - History class first time he'd encountered teacher literally sentient.  And showed, too. Harry given five minutes started reading textbook. When became clear "Professor Binns" going object, Harry also reached pouch gotten earplugs.  Did ghosts require salary? Was it? Or literally impossible fire anyone Hogwarts even died?  Now seemed Professor Snape going absolutely awful everyone Slytherin even occurred anyone terminate contract.  And Headmaster set fire chicken.  "Excuse me," came worried voice behind him.  "I swear," Harry said without turning around, "this place almost eight half percent bad Dad says Oxford."   Harry stamped stone corridors, looking affronted, annoyed, infuriated once.  "Dungeons!" Harry hissed. "Dungeons!  These dungeons! This basement! A basement!"  Some Ravenclaw girls gave odd looks. The boys used now.  It seemed level Potions classroom located called "dungeons" better reason ground slightly colder main castle.  In Hogwarts! In Hogwarts! Harry waiting whole life still waiting anywhere face Earth decent dungeons ought Hogwarts! Was Harry going to build castle wanted see one little bottomless abyss?  A short time later got actual Potions classroom Harry cheered considerably.  The Potions classroom strange preserved creatures floating huge jars shelves covered every centimeter wall space closets. Harry gotten far enough along reading could actually identify creatures, like Zabriskan Fontema. Albeit fifty-centimeter spider looked like Acromantula small one. He'd tried asking Hermione, seemed interested looking anywhere near pointing.  Harry looking large dust ball eyes feet assassin swept room.  That first thought crossed Harry's mind saw Professor Severus Snape. There something quiet deadly way man stalked children's desks. His robes unkempt, hair spotted greasy. There something seemed reminiscent Lucius, although two looked nothing remotely alike, got impression Lucius would kill flawless elegance, man would simply kill you.  "Sit down," said Professor Severus Snape. "Now."  Harry children standing around talking scrambled desks. Harry planned ending next Hermione somehow found sitting nearest empty desk next Justin Finch-Fletchley (it Doubles session, Ravenclaw Hufflepuff) put two desks left Hermione.  Severus seated behind teacher's desk, without slightest transition introduction, said, "Hannah Abbott."  "Here," said Hannah somewhat trembling voice.  "Susan Bones."  "Present."  And went, one daring say word edgewise, until:  "Ah, yes. Harry Potter. Our new... celebrity."  "The celebrity present, sir."  Half class flinched, smarter ones suddenly looked like wanted run door classroom still there.  Severus smiled anticipatory sort way called next name list.  Harry gave mental sigh. That happened way fast anything it. Oh well. Clearly man already like him, whatever reason. And Harry thought it, better far Potions professor pick rather than, say, Neville Hermione. Harry lot better able defend himself. Yep, probably best.  When full attendance taken, Severus swept gaze full class. His eyes empty night sky without stars.  "You here," Severus said quiet voice students back strained hear, "to learn subtle science exact art potionmaking. As little foolish wand-waving here, many hardly believe magic. I expect really understand beauty softly simmering cauldron shimmering fumes, delicate power liquids creep human veins," rather caressing, gloating tone, "bewitching mind, ensnaring senses," getting creepier creepier. "I teach bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death - great pack fools I usually teach."  Severus somehow seemed notice look skepticism Harry's face, least eyes suddenly jumped Harry sitting.  "Potter!" snapped Potions professor. "What would I get I added powdered root asphodel infusion wormwood?"  Harry blinked. "Was Magical Drafts Potions?" said. "I finished reading it, I remember anything used wormwood -"  Hermione's hand went Harry shot glare caused raise hand even higher.  "Tut, tut," Severus said silkily. "Fame clearly everything."  "Really?" Harry said. "But told us teach us bottle fame. Say, work, exactly? You drink turn celebrity?"  Three-quarters class flinched.  Hermione's hand dropping slowly back down. Well, surprising. She might rival, sort girl would play along became clear professor deliberately trying humiliate him.  Harry trying hard keep control temper. The first rejoinder crossed mind 'Abracadabra'.  "Let's try again," said Severus. "Potter, would look I told find bezoar?"  "That's textbook either," Harry said, "but one Muggle book I read trichinobezoar mass solidified hair found human stomach, Muggles used believe would cure poison -"  "Wrong," Severus said. "A bezoar found stomach goat, made hair, cure poisons all."  "I say would, I said I read one Muggle book -"  "No one interested pathetic Muggle books. Final try. What difference, Potter, monksblood wolfsbane?"  That it.  "You know," Harry said icily, "in one quite fascinating Muggle books, describe study people managed make look smart asking questions random facts knew. Apparently onlookers noticed askers knew answerers didn't, failed adjust unfairness underlying game. So, Professor, tell many electrons outermost orbital carbon atom?"  Severus's smile widened. "Four," said. "It useless fact one bother writing down, however. And information, Potter, asphodel wormwood make sleeping potion powerful known Draught Living Death. As monkshood wolfsbane, plant, also goes name aconite, would know read One Thousand Magical Herbs Fungi. Thought need open book coming, eh, Potter? All rest copying ignorant him." Severus paused, looking quite pleased himself. "And be... five points? No, let us make even ten points Ravenclaw backchat."  Hermione gasped, along number others.  "Professor Severus Snape," Harry bit out. "I know nothing I done earn enmity. If problem I know about, I suggest -"  "Shut up, Potter. Ten points Ravenclaw. The rest you, open books page 3."  There slight, faint burning sensation back Harry's throat, moisture eyes. If crying effective strategy destroying Potions professor point crying.  Slowly, Harry sat straight. All blood seemed drained away replaced liquid nitrogen. He knew he'd trying keep temper seem remember why.  "Harry," whispered Hermione frantically two desks over, "stop, please, right, count -"  "Talking class, Granger? Three -"  "So," said voice colder zero Kelvin, "how one go filing formal complaint abusive professor? Does one talk Deputy Headmistress, write letter Board Governors... would care explain works?"  The class utterly frozen.  "Detention one month, Potter," Severus said, smiling even broadly.  "I decline recognize authority teacher I serve detention give."  People stopped breathing.  Severus's smile vanished. "Then -" voice stopped short.  "Expelled, say?" Harry, hand, smiling thinly. "But seemed doubt ability carry threat, fear consequences did. I, hand, neither doubt fear prospect finding school less abusive professors. Or perhaps I hire private tutors, accustomed practice, taught full learning speed. I enough money vault. Something bounties Dark Lord I defeated. But teachers Hogwarts I rather like, I think easier I find way get rid instead."  "Get rid me?" Severus said, also smiling thinly. "What amusing conceit. How suppose that, Potter?"  "I understand number complaints students parents," guess safe one, "which leaves question already gone. Is Hogwarts financially strapped afford real Potions professor? I could chip in, so. I'm sure could find better class teacher offered double current salary."  Two poles ice radiated freezing winter across classroom.  "You find," Severus said softly, "that Board Governers slightest bit sympathetic offer."  "Lucius..." Harry said. "That's still here. Perhaps I chat Lucius that. I believe desires meet me. I wonder I anything wants?"  Hermione frantically shook head. Harry noticed corner eye, attention Severus.  "You foolish boy," Severus said. He smiling all, now. "You nothing Lucius values friendship. And did, I allies." His voice grew hard. "And I find increasingly unlikely Sorted Slytherin. How managed stay House? Ah, yes, Sorting Hat claimed joking. For first time recorded history. What really chatting Sorting Hat, Potter? Did something wanted?"  Harry stared Severus's cold gaze remembered Sorting Hat warned meet anyone's eyes thinking - Harry dropped gaze Severus's desk.  "You seem oddly reluctant look eyes, Potter!"  A shock sudden understanding - "So Sorting Hat warning about!"  "What?" said Severus's voice, sounding genuinely surprised, though course Harry look face.  Harry got desk.  "Sit down, Potter," said angry voice somewhere looking.  Harry ignored it, looked around classroom. "I intention letting one unprofessional teacher ruin time Hogwarts," Harry said deadly calm. "I think I'll take leave class, either hire tutor teach Potions I'm here, Board really locked up, learn summer. If decide care bullied man, sessions open you."  "Sit down, Potter!"  Harry strode across room grasped doorknob.  It turn.  Harry slowly turned around, caught glimpse Severus smiling nastily remembered look away.  "Open door."  "No," said Severus.  "You making feel threatened," said voice icy sound like Harry's all, "and mistake."  Severus's voice laughed. "What intend it, little boy?"  Harry took six long strides forward away door, standing near back row desks.  Then Harry drew upright raised right hand one terrible motion, fingers poised snap.  Neville screamed dived desk. Other children shrank back instinctively raised arms shield themselves.  "Harry don't!" shrieked Hermione. "Whatever going to him, it!"  "Have gone mad?" barked Severus's voice.  Slowly, Harry lowered hand. "I going hurt him, Hermione," Harry said, voice little lower. "I going blow door."  Though Harry remembered it, supposed Transfigure things burned, meant going back time afterward getting Fred George Transfigure carefully measured amount explosives might actually good idea...  "Silencio," said Severus's voice.  Harry tried say "What?" found sound coming out.  "This become ridiculous. I think allowed get enough trouble one day, Potter. You disruptive unruly student I ever seen, I recall many points Ravenclaw right now, I'm sure I manage wipe out. Ten points Ravenclaw. Ten points Ravenclaw. Ten points Ravenclaw! Fifty points Ravenclaw! Now sit watch rest class take lesson!"  Harry put hand pouch tried say 'marker' course words came out. For one brief moment stopped him; occurred Harry spell M-A-R-K-E-R using finger motions, worked. P-A-D pad paper. Harry strode empty desk, one he'd originally sat in, scrawled brief message. He tore sheet paper, put away marker pad pocket robes quicker access, held message, Snape, rest class.  I'M LEAVING   DOES ANYONE ELSE   NEED TO GET OUT?  "You're insane, Potter," Severus said cold contempt.  Aside that, one spoke.  Harry swept ironic bow teacher's desk, walked wall, one smooth motion yanked open closet door, stepped in, slammed door shut behind him.  There muffled sound someone snapping fingers, nothing.  In classroom, students looked puzzlement fear.  The Potions Master's face completely enraged. He crossed room terrible strides yanked open closet door.  The closet empty.   One hour earlier, Harry listened inside closed closet. There sound outside, point taking risks either.  C-L-O-A-K, fingers spelled out.  Once invisible, carefully slowly cracked open closet door peeked out. No one seemed classroom.  The door locked.  It Harry outside dangerous place inside hallway, safely invisible, anger drained away realized he'd done.  What he'd done.  Harry's invisible face frozen absolute horror.  He'd antagonized teacher three orders magnitude beyond anything he'd ever managed before. He'd threatened walk Hogwarts might follow it. He'd lost points Ravenclaw he'd used Time-Turner...  His imagination showed parents yelling expelled, Professor McGonagall disappointed him, painful bear think way save -  The thought Harry allowed think getting angry gotten trouble, maybe angry he'd think way out, things seemed clearer somehow angry.  And thought Harry let think face future angry.  So cast thoughts back remembered burning humiliation -  Tut, tut. Fame clearly everything.  Ten points Ravenclaw backchat.  The calming cold washed back veins like wave reflected returning breaker, Harry let breath.  Okay. Back sane now.  He actually feeling bit disappointed non-angry self collapsing like wanting get trouble. Professor Severus Snape everyone's problem. Normal-Harry forgotten wished way protect himself. And let victims go hang? The question protect himself, question destroy Potions professor.  So dark side, it?Bit prejudiced term that, light side seems selfish cowardly, mention confused panicky.  And thinking clearly, equally clear next. He'd already given extra hour prepare, could get five hours required...   Minerva McGonagall waited Headmaster's office.  Dumbledore sat padded throne behind desk, dressed four layers formal lavender robes. Minerva sat chair him, opposite Severus another chair. Facing three empty wooden stool.  They waiting Harry Potter.  Harry, Minerva thought despairingly, promised bite teachers!  And mind could see clearly reply, Harry's angry face outraged response: I said I bite anyone bite first!  There knock door.  "Come in!" Dumbledore called.  The door swept open, Harry Potter entered. Minerva almost gasped loud. The boy looked cool, collected, utterly control himself.  "Good mor-" Harry's voice suddenly cut off. His jaw dropped.  Minerva tracked Harry's gaze, saw Harry staring Fawkes phoenix sat golden perch. Fawkes fluttered bright red-golden wings like flickering flame, dipped head measured nod boy.  Harry turned stare Dumbledore.  Dumbledore winked him.  Minerva felt missing something.  Sudden uncertainty crossed Harry's face. His coolness wavered. Fear showed eyes, anger, boy calm again.  A chill went Minerva's spine. Something right here.  "Please sit down," said Dumbledore. His face serious more.  Harry sat.  "So, Harry," said Dumbledore. "I've heard one report day Professor Snape. Would care tell happened words?"  Harry's gaze flicked dismissively Severus. "It's complicated," said boy, smiling thinly. "He tried bullying way he's bullying every non-Slytherin school since day Lucius foisted you. As details, I request private conversation concerning them. A student reporting abusive behavior professor hardly expected speak frankly front professor, all."  This time Minerva stop gasping loud.  Severus simply laughed.  And Headmaster's face grew grave. "Mr. Potter," Headmaster said, "one speak Hogwarts professor terms. I fear labor terrible misapprehension. Professor Severus Snape fullest confidence, serves Hogwarts behest, Lucius Malfoy's."  There silence moments.  When boy spoke voice icy. "Am I missing something here?"  "Quite number things, Mr. Potter," said Headmaster. "You understand, start with, purpose meeting discuss discipline events morning."  "This man terrorized school years. I spoke students collected stories make sure would enough newspaper campaign rally parents him. Some younger students cried told me. I almost cried I heard them! You allowed abuser run free? You students? Why?"  Minerva swallowed lump throat. She'd - thought that, sometimes, somehow she'd never quite -  "Mr. Potter," said Headmaster, voice stern, "this meeting Professor Snape. It disregard school discipline. Professor Snape suggested, I agreed, three full months detention appropriate -"  "Declined," Harry said icily.  Minerva speechless.  "This request, Mr. Potter," Headmaster said. The full, entire force wizard's gaze turned boy. "This punishme-"  "You explain allowed man hurt children placed care, explanation sufficient I begin newspaper campaign target."  Minerva's body swayed force blow, sheer raw lese majeste.  Even Severus looked shocked.  "That, Harry, would extremely unwise," Dumbledore said slowly. "I primary piece opposing Lucius gameboard. For thing would strengthen greatly, I think chosen side."  The boy still long moment.  "This conversation grows private," Harry said. His hand flicked Severus's direction. "Send away."  Dumbledore shook head. "Harry, I tell Severus Snape fullest confidence?"  The boy's face showed shock it. "This man's bullying makes vulnerable! I one could start newspaper campaign you! This insane! Why this?"  Dumbledore sighed. "I'm sorry, Harry. It things not, time, ready hear."  The boy stared Dumbledore. Then turned look Severus. Then back Dumbledore again.  "It insanity," boy said slowly. "You reined think he's part pattern. That Hogwarts needs evil Potions Master proper magical school, needs ghost teach History."  "That sound like sort thing I would do, it?" said Dumbledore, smiling.  "Unacceptable," Harry said flatly. His gaze cold dark. "I tolerate bullying abuse. I considered many possible ways dealing problem, I make simple. Either man goes, I do."  Minerva gasped again. Something strange flickered Severus's eyes.  Now Dumbledore's gaze also growing cold. "Expulsion, Mr. Potter, final threat may used student. It customarily used threat students Headmaster. This best magical school entire world, education opportunity given everyone. Are impression Hogwarts cannot get along without you?"  And Harry sat there, smiling thinly.  Sudden horror dawned Minerva. Surely Harry -  "You forget," Harry said, "that one see patterns. This grows private. Now send -" Harry flicked hand Severus again, stopped mid-sentence mid-gesture.  Minerva could see Harry's face, moment remembered.  She'd told him, all.  "Mr. Potter," said Headmaster, "once again, Severus Snape fullest confidence."  "You told him," whispered boy. "You utter fool."  Dumbledore react insult. "Told what?"  "That Dark Lord alive."  "What Merlin's name about, Potter?" cried Severus tones sheer astonishment outrage.  Harry glanced briefly him, smiling grimly. "Oh, Slytherin, then," Harry said. "I starting wonder."  And silence.  Finally Dumbledore spoke. His voice mild. "Harry, talking about?"  "I'm sorry, Albus," Minerva whispered.  Severus Dumbledore turned look her.  "Professor McGonagall tell me," said Harry's voice, swiftly less calm been. "I guessed. I told you, I see patterns too. I guessed, controlled reaction Severus did. But control fell shade short perfection, I could tell control, genuine."  "And I told him," said Minerva, voice trembling little, "that you, I, Severus ones knew."  "Which concession prevent simply going around asking questions, I threatened talk," Harry said. The boy chuckled briefly. "I really gotten one alone told told everything, see let anything slip. Probably worked, would worth shot." The boy smiled again. "Threat's still table I expect briefed fully point."  Severus giving look utter contempt. Minerva raised chin bore it. She knew deserved.  Dumbledore leaned back padded throne. His eyes cold anything Minerva seen since day brother died. "And threaten abandon us Voldemort comply wishes."  Harry's voice razor-sharp. "I regret inform center universe. I'm threatening walk magical Britain. I'm threatening walk you. I meek little Frodo. This quest want play rules."  Dumbledore's face still cold. "I beginning doubt suitability hero, Mr. Potter."  Harry's return gaze equally icy. "I beginning doubt suitability Gandalf, Mr. Dumbledore. Boromir least plausible mistake. What Nazgul Fellowship?"  Minerva completely lost. She looked Severus, see following this, saw Severus turned face away Harry's field vision smiling.  "I suppose," Dumbledore said slowly, "that perspective reasonable question. So, Mr. Potter, Professor Snape leave alone henceforth, last time issue arises, I find every week new demand?"  "Leave alone?" Harry's voice outraged. "I victim certainly vulnerable! Have forgotten defenseless children are? How much hurt? Henceforth Severus treat every student Hogwarts appropriate professional courtesy, find another Potions Master, find another hero!"  Dumbledore started laughing. Full-throated, warm, humorous laughter, Harry performed comic dance front him.  Minerva dare move. Her eyes flickered saw Severus equally motionless.  Harry's visage grew even colder. "You mistake me, Headmaster, think joke. This request. This punishment."  "Mr. Potter -" Minerva said. She even know going say. She simply let go by.  Harry made shushing gesture continued speak Dumbledore. "And seems impolite you," Harry said, voice little less hard, "it seemed less impolite said me. You would say thing anyone considered real human instead subordinate child, I treat courtesy treat -"  "Oh, indeed, deed, punishment ever one! Of course blackmailing save fellow students, save yourself! I can't imagine I would thought otherwise!" Dumbledore laughing even harder. He pounded fist desk three times.  Harry's gaze grew uncertain. His face turned toward her, addressing first time. "Excuse me," Harry said. His voice seemed wavering. "Does need take medication something?"  "Ah..." Minerva idea could possibly say.  "Well," said Dumbledore. He wiped away tears formed eyes. "Pardon me. I'm sorry interruption. Please continue blackmail."  Harry opened mouth, closed again. He seemed little unsteady. "Ah... he's also stop reading students' minds."  "Minerva," Severus said, voice deadly, "you -"  "Sorting Hat warned me," said Harry.  "What?"  "Can't say anything else. Anyway I think that's it. I'm done."  Silence.  "Now what?" Minerva said, became apparent one else going say anything.  "Now what?" Dumbledore echoed. "Why, hero wins, course."  "What?" said Severus, Minerva, Harry.  "Well, certainly seems backed us corner," Dumbledore said, smiling happily. "But Hogwarts need evil Potions Master, proper magical school, would it? So Professor Snape awful toward students fifth year higher?"  "What?" said three again.  "If vulnerable victims concerned. Maybe right, Harry. Maybe I forgotten decades like child. So let's compromise. Severus continue unfairly award points Slytherin impose lax discipline House, awful non-Slytherin students fifth year higher. To others scary, abusive. He promise read minds safety student requires it. Hogwarts evil Potions Master, vulnerable victims, put it, safe."  Minerva McGonagall shocked she'd ever life. She glanced uncertainly Severus, whose face left completely neutral, though decide sort expression ought wearing.  "I suppose acceptable," Harry said. His voice sounded bit odd.  "You can't serious," Severus said, voice expressionless face.  "I much favor this," Minerva said slowly. She much favor heart pounding wildly beneath robes. "But could possibly tell students? They might questioned Severus was... awful everyone, -"  "Harry tell students discovered terrible secret Severus's bit blackmail," said Dumbledore. "It's true, all; discovered Severus reading minds, certainly blackmail us."  "This insanity!" exploded Severus.  "Bwah ha ha!" said Dumbledore.  "Ah..." said Harry uncertainly. "And anyone asks fifth years got shafted? I blame irate, part exactly idea -"  "Tell them," said Dumbledore, "that suggested compromise, could get. And refuse say anything more. That, too, true. There's art it, pick practice."  Harry nodded slowly. "And points took Ravenclaw?"  "They must given back."  It Minerva said it.  Harry looked her.  "I'm sorry, Mr. Potter," said. She sorry, done. "There must consequences misbehavior school fall pieces."  Harry shrugged. "Acceptable," said flatly. "But future Severus strike House connections taking points me, waste valuable time detentions. Should feel behavior requires correction, may communicate concerns Professor McGonagall."  "Harry," Minerva said, "will continue submit school discipline, law now, Severus was?"  Harry looked her. Something warm touched gaze, briefly quashed. "I continue ordinary student every member staff insane evil, provided come pressure others are." Harry glanced briefly Severus, turned back Dumbledore. "Leave Minerva alone, I'll regular Hogwarts student presence. No special privileges immunities."  "Beautiful," Dumbledore said sincerely. "Spoken like true hero."  "And," said, "Mr. Potter must publicly apologize actions today."  Harry gave another look. This one bit skeptical.  "The discipline school gravely injured actions, Mr. Potter," Minerva said. "It must restored."  "I think, Professor McGonagall, considerably overestimate importance call school discipline, compared History taught live teacher torturing students. Maintaining current status hierarchy enforcing rules seems ever much wise moral important top enforcing bottom, I cite studies effect required. I could go several hours point, I leave that."  Minerva shook head. "Mr. Potter, underestimate importance discipline need -" She paused. That come right, Severus, Dumbledore, even Harry giving strange looks. "To learn, I mean. Not every child learn absence authority. And children hurt, Mr. Potter, see example one followed."  Harry's lips curved twisted smile. "The first last resort truth. The truth I gotten angry, I disrupted class, I done I did, I set bad example everyone. The truth also Severus Snape behaved fashion unbecoming Hogwarts professor, mindful injured feelings students fourth year under. The two us could get speak truth. I could live that."  "In dreams, Potter!" spat Severus.  "After all," said Harry, smiling grimly, "if students see rules everyone... professors too, poor helpless students get nothing suffering system... why, positive effects school discipline tremendous."  There brief pause, Dumbledore chuckled. "Minerva thinking righter right be."  Harry's gaze jerked away Dumbledore, floor. "Are reading mind?"  "Common sense often mistaken Legilimency," said Dumbledore. "I shall talk matter Severus, apology required unless apologizes well. And I declare matter concluded, least lunchtime." He paused. "Although, Harry, I'm afraid Minerva wished speak additional matter. And result pressure part. Minerva, would?"  Minerva rose chair almost fell. There much adrenaline blood, heart beating fast.  "Fawkes," said Dumbledore, "accompany her, please."  "I -" started say.  Dumbledore shot look, fell silent.  The phoenix soared across room like smooth tongue flame leaping out, landed shoulder. She felt warmth robes, body.  "Please follow me, Mr. Potter," said, firmly now, left door.   They stood rotating stairs, descending silence.  Minerva know say. She know person stood beside her.  And Fawkes began croon.  It tender, soft, like fireplace would sound melody, washed Minerva's mind, easing, soothing, gentling touched...  "What that?" Harry whispered beside her. His voice unstable, wobbling, changing pitch.  "The song phoenix," said Minerva, really aware saying, attention strange quiet music. "It, too, heals."  Harry turned face her, caught glimpse something agonized.  The descent seemed take long time, maybe music seemed take long time, stepped gap gargoyle been, holding Harry's hand firmly hers.  As gargoyle stepped back place, Fawkes left shoulder, swooped hover front Harry.  Harry stared Fawkes like someone hypnotized ever-changing light fire.  "What I do, Fawkes?" whispered Harry. "I protected I angry."  The phoenix's wings continued flapping, continued hovering place. There sound beating wings. Then flash like fire flaring going out, Fawkes gone.  Both blinked, like waking dream, maybe like falling asleep again.  Minerva looked down.  Harry Potter's bright young face looked her.  "Are phoenixes people?" said Harry. "I mean, smart enough count people? Could I talk Fawkes I knew how?"  Minerva blinked hard. Then blinked again. "No," Minerva said, voice wavering. "Phoenixes creatures powerful magic. That magic gives existence weight meaning simple animal could possess. They fire, light, healing, rebirth. But end, no."  "Where I get one?"  Minerva leaned hugged him. She meant to, seem much choice matter.  When stood found hard speak. But ask. "What happened today, Harry?"  "I know answers important questions either. Aside I'd really rather think while."  Minerva took hand again, walked rest way silence.  It short trip, since naturally office Deputy close office Headmaster.  Minerva sat behind desk.  Harry sat front desk.  "So," Minerva whispered. She would given almost anything this, one it, time right now. "There matter school discipline. From exempt."  "Namely?" said Harry.  He know. He figured yet. She felt throat tighten. But work done would shirk it.  "Mr. Potter," said Professor McGonagall, "I need see Time-Turner, please."  All peace phoenix vanished face instant Minerva felt like stabbed him.  "No!" Harry said. His voice panicked. "I need it, I able attend Hogwarts, I able sleep!"  "You'll able sleep," said. "The Ministry delivered protective shell Time-Turner. I enchant open hours 9PM midnight."  Harry's face twisted. "But - I -"  "Mr. Potter, many times used Time-Turner since Monday? How many hours?"  "I..." Harry said. "Hold on, let add -" He glanced watch.  Minerva felt rush sadness. She'd thought so. "It two per day, then. I suspect I asked dormmates, I would find struggling stay long enough go sleep reasonable time, waking earlier earlier every morning. Correct?"  Harry's face said everything needed know.  "Mr. Potter," said gently, "there students cannot entrusted Time-Turners, become addicted them. We give potion lengthens sleep cycle necessary amount, end using Time-Turner attending classes. And must take back. Mr. Potter, taken using Time-Turner solution everything, often foolishly so. You used get back Remembrall. You vanished closet fashion apparent students, instead going back getting someone else come open door."  From look Harry's face thought that.  "And importantly," said, "you simply sat Professor Snape's class. And watched. And left end class. As would done possessed Time-Turner. There students cannot entrusted Time-Turners, Mr. Potter. You one them. I sorry."  "But I need it!" Harry blurted. "What Slytherins threatening I escape? It keeps safe -"  "Every student castle runs risk, I assure survive. No student died castle fifty years. Mr. Potter, hand Time-Turner now."  Harry's face twisted agony, drew Time-Turner robes gave her.  From desk, Minerva drew one protective shells sent Hogwarts. She snapped cover place around Time-Turner's turning hourglass, laid wand cover complete enchantment.  "This fair!" Harry shrieked. "I saved half Hogwarts Professor Snape today, right I punished it? I saw look face, hated doing!"  Minerva speak moments. She enchanting.  When finished looked up, knew face stern. Maybe wrong thing do. And maybe right thing do. There obstinate child front her, mean universe broken.  "Fair, Mr. Potter?" snapped. "I file two reports Ministry public use Time-Turner two successive days! Be extremely grateful allowed retain Time-Turner even restricted form! The Headmaster made Floo call plead personally Boy-Who-Lived even would sufficed!"  Harry gaped her.  She knew seeing angry face Professor McGonagall.  Harry's eyes filled tears.  "I'm, sorry," whispered, voice choked broken. "I'm sorry, have, disappointed you..."  "I'm sorry too, Mr. Potter," said sternly, handed newly restricted Time-Turner. "You may go."  Harry turned fled office, sobbing. She heard feet pattering away hall, sound cut door swung closed.  "I'm sorry too, Harry," whispered quiet room. "I'm sorry too."   Fifteen minutes lunch hour.  No one speaking Harry. Some Ravenclaws shooting looks anger, others sympathy, youngest students even looks admiration, one talking him. Even Hermione tried come over.  Fred George gingerly stepped near. They said anything. The offer clear, optionality. Harry told would come dessert started, earlier. They nodded quickly walked away.  It probably utterly expressionless look Harry's face it.  The others probably thought controlling anger, dismay. They knew, they'd seen Flitwick come get him, he'd called Headmaster's office.  Harry trying smile, smiled, would start laughing, started laughing, stop nice people white jackets came haul away.  It much. It much. Harry almost gone Dark Side, dark side done things seemed retrospect insane, dark side impossible victory might real might pure whim crazy Headmaster, dark side protected friends. He handle more. He needed Fawkes sing again. He needed use Time-Turner go take quiet hour recover option loss like hole existence think might start laughing.  Twenty minutes. All students going eat lunch arrived, almost none departed.  The tapping spoon rang Great Hall.  "If I may attention please," Dumbledore said. "Harry Potter something would like share us."  Harry took deep breath got up. He walked Head Table, every eye staring him.  Harry turned looked four tables.  It becoming harder harder smile, Harry kept face expressionless spoke brief memorized speech.  "The truth sacred," Harry said tonelessly. "One treasured possessions button reads 'Speak truth, even voice trembles'. This, then, truth. Remember that. I saying I forced say it, I saying true. What I Professor Snape's class foolish, stupid, childish, inexcusable violation rules Hogwarts. I disrupted classroom deprived fellow students irreplaceable learning time. All I failed control temper. I hope single one ever follow example. I certainly intend try never follow again."  Many students gazing Harry solemn, unhappy looks upon faces, one might see ceremony marking loss fallen champion. At younger parts Gryffindor table look almost universal.  Until Harry raised hand.  He raise high. That might appeared preemptory. He certainly raise toward Severus. Harry simply raised hand chest level, softly snapped fingers, gesture seen heard. It possible Head Table see all.  This seeming gesture defiance sudden smiles younger students Gryffindors, coldly superior sneers Slytherin, frowns worried looks others.  Harry kept face expressionless. "Thank you," said. "That's all."  "Thank you, Mr. Potter," said Headmaster. "And Professor Snape something share us well."  Severus smoothly stood place Head Table. "It brought attention," said, "that actions played part provoking admittedly inexcusable anger Mr. Potter, ensuing discussion I realized I forgotten easily injured feelings young immature -"  There sound many people emitting muffled chokes time.  Severus continued heard. "The Potions classroom dangerous place, I still feel strict discipline necessary, henceforth I aware the... emotional fragility... students fourth year younger. My deduction points Ravenclaw still stands, I revoke Mr. Potter's detention. Thank you."  There single clap direction Gryffindor faster lightning Severus's wand hand "Quietus!" silenced offender.  "I still demand discipline respect classes," Severus said coldly, "and anyone trifles regret it."  He sat down.  "Thank too!" Headmaster Dumbledore said cheerfully. "Carry on!"  And Harry, still expressionless, began walk back seat Ravenclaw.  There explosion conversation. Two words clearly identifiable beginning. The first initial "What -" beginning many different sentences "What happened -" "What hell -" The second "Scourgify!" students cleaned dropped food spit-out drinks themselves, tablecloth, other.  Some students weeping openly. So Professor Sprout.  At Gryffindor table, cake waited fifty-one unlit candles, Fred whispered, "I think may league here, George."  And day onward, matter Hermione tried tell anyone, would accepted legend Hogwarts Harry Potter could make absolutely anything happen snapping fingers.   Chapter 19: Delayed Gratification  Blood blood god! Skulls J. K. Rowling!   Draco stern expression face, green-trimmed robes somehow looked far formal, serious, well-turned-out exact robes worn two boys behind him.  "Talk," said Draco.  "Yeah! Talk!"  "You heard da boss! Talk!"  "You two, hand, shut up."  The last session classes Friday start, vast auditorium four Houses learned Defense, er, Battle Magic.  The last session classes Friday.  Harry hoping class would non-stressful, brilliant Professor Quirrell would realize perhaps best time single Harry anything. Harry recovered little, but...  ...but case, probably best get bit stress relief first.  Harry leaned back chair bestowed look great solemnity upon Draco minions.  "You ask, aim?" Harry declaimed. "I answer one word. It victory. Victory costs - Victory spite terrors - Victory, however long hard road may be, without victory -"  "Talk Snape," Draco hissed. "What do?"  Harry wiped away fake solemnity gave Draco serious look.  "You saw it," Harry said. "Everyone saw it. I snapped fingers."  "Harry! Stop teasing me!"  So he'd promoted Harry now. Interesting. And fact Harry fairly sure meant notice that, feel bad respond somehow...  Harry tapped ears gave significant glance minions.  "They talk," said Draco.  "Draco," Harry said, "I'm going one hundred percent honest say yesterday I particularly impressed Mr. Goyle's cunning."  Mr. Goyle winced.  "Me neither," said Draco. "I explained I ended owing favor it." (Mr. Goyle winced again.) "But big difference sort mistake indiscreet. That really something they've trained childhood understand."  "All right then," Harry said. He lowered voice, even though background noises gone blurs Draco's presence. "I deduced one Severus's secrets bit blackmail."  Draco's expression hardened. "Good, tell something tell strict confidence idiots Gryffindor, meaning story wanted get school."  Harry grinned involuntarily knew Draco caught it.  "What Severus saying?" Harry said.  "That realized sensitive feelings young children were," Draco said. "Even Slytherin! Even me!"  "Are sure," Harry said, "that want know something Head House would rather know?"  "Yes," Draco said without hesitation.  Interesting. "Then really going send minions away first, I'm sure I believe everything believe them."  Draco nodded. "Okay."  Mr. Crabbe Mr. Goyle looked unhappy. "Boss -" said Mr. Crabbe.  "You've given Mr. Potter reason trust you," Draco said. "Go!"  They left.  "In particular," Harry said, lowering voice even further, "I'm entirely sure report I said Lucius."  "Father that!" Draco said, looking genuinely aghast. "They're mine!"  "I'm sorry, Draco," Harry said. "I'm sure I believe everything believe father. Imagine secret telling father that."  Draco nodded slowly. "You're right. I'm sorry, Harry. It wrong ask you."  How I get promoted? Shouldn't hate now? Harry feeling looking something exploitable... wished brain exhausted. Ordinarily would loved try hand complicated plotting.  "Anyway," Harry said. "Trade. I tell fact grapevine, go grapevine, particular go father, return tell Slytherin think whole business."  "Deal!"  Now make vague possible... something hurt much even get out... "What I said true. I discover one Severus's secrets, I blackmail. But Severus person involved."  "I knew it!" Draco said exultantly.  Harry's stomach sank. He apparently said something significant know why. This good sign.  "All right," Draco said. He grinning widely now. "So here's reaction like Slytherin. First, idiots like, 'We hate Harry Potter! Let's go beat up!'"  Harry choked. "What wrong Sorting Hat? That's Slytherin, Gryffindor -"  "Not children prodigies," Draco said, though smiling sort nasty-conspiratorial way, though suggest privately agreed Harry's opinion. "And took around fifteen seconds someone explain might favor Snape, fine. Anyway, second wave idiots, ones saying, 'Looks like Harry Potter another do-gooder all.'"  "And then?" Harry said, smiling even though idea stupid.  "And actual smart people started talking. It's obvious found way put lot pressure Snape. And could one thing... obvious next thought something Snape's unknown hold Dumbledore. Am I right?"  "No comment," Harry said. At least brain processing part correctly. House Slytherin wondered Severus getting fired. And they'd concluded Severus blackmailing Dumbledore. Could actually true...? But Dumbledore seemed act like it...  Draco went talking. "And next thing smart people pointed could put enough pressure Snape make leave half Hogwarts alone, meant probably enough power get rid entirely, wanted. What humiliation, way tried humiliate - left us Head House."  Harry made smile wider.  "And really smart people," Draco said, face serious, "went little discussion themselves, someone pointed would stupid thing leave enemy around like that. If could break hold Dumbledore, obvious thing would it. Dumbledore would kick Snape Hogwarts maybe even killed, he'd grateful you, worry Snape sneaking dorm room night interesting potions."  Harry's face neutral. He thought really, really have. "And concluded...?"  "Snape's hold secret Dumbledore's got secret!" Draco looking exultant. "It can't powerful enough destroy Dumbledore entirely, Snape would used now. Snape refuses use hold anything except staying king Slytherin House Hogwarts, always get wants even then, must limits. But got really good! Father's trying get Snape tell years!"  "And," Harry said, "now Lucius thinks maybe I tell him. Did already get owl -"  "I tonight," Draco said, laughed. "It say," voice took different, formal cadence, "My beloved son: I've already told Harry Potter's potential importance. As already realized, importance become greater urgent. If see possible avenue friendship point pressure him, must pursue it, full resources Malfoy disposal needed."  Gosh. "Well," Harry said, "not commenting whether whole complicated edifice theory true, let say quite good friends yet."  "I know," Draco said. Then face turned serious, voice grew quiet even within blur. "Harry, occurred know something Dumbledore want known, Dumbledore might simply killed? And would turn Boy-Who-Lived potential competing leader valuable martyr, too."  "No comment," Harry said yet again. He thought last part, either. Didn't seem Dumbledore's style... but...  "Harry," Draco said, "you've obviously got incredible talent, got training mentors stupid things sometimes really need advisor knows going get hurt!" Draco's face fierce.  "Ah," Harry said. "An advisor like Lucius?"  "Like me!" said Draco. "I'll promise keep secrets Father, everyone, I'll help figure whatever want do!"  Wow.  Harry saw zombie-Quirrell staggering doors.  "Class start," said Harry. "I'll think said, there's lots times I wish I training, I know I trust quickly -"  "You shouldn't," Draco said, "it's soon. See? I'll give good advice even hurts me. But maybe hurry become closer friends."  "I'm open that," said Harry, already trying figure exploit it.  "Another bit advice," Draco said hurriedly Quirrell slouched toward desk, "right everyone Slytherin's wondering you, courting us, I think are, something signals friendship Slytherin. Soon, like today tomorrow."  "Letting Severus go awarding extra House points Slytherin enough?" No reason Harry take credit it.  Draco's eyes flickered realization, said rapidly, "It's same, trust me, got something obvious. Push mudblood rival Granger wall something, everyone Slytherin know means -"  "That works Ravenclaw, Draco! If push someone wall means brain weak beat right way everyone Ravenclaw knows -"  The screen Harry's desk flickered on, provoking sudden wash nostalgia television computers.  "Ahem," said Professor Quirrell's voice, seeming speak personally Harry screen. "Please take seats."   And children seated staring repeater screens desks, looking directly great white marble stage Professor Quirrell stood, leaning desk atop small dais darker marble.  "Today," said Professor Quirrell, "I planned teach first defensive spell, small shield ancestor today's Protego. But second thought I changed today's lesson plan light recent events."  Professor Quirrell's gaze searched rows seats. Harry winced sitting, back row. He feeling knew called on.  "Draco, Noble Most Ancient House Malfoy," said Professor Quirrell.  Whew.  "Yes, Professor?" said Draco. His voice amplified, seeming come repeater screen Harry's desk, showed Draco's face spoke. Then screen shifted back Professor Quirrell, said:  "Is ambition become next Dark Lord?"  "That's odd question, Professor," said Draco. "I mean, who'd dumb enough admit it?"  A students laughed, many.  "Indeed," said Professor Quirrell. "So there's point asking you, would surprise slightest student two classes harbored ambitions next Dark Lord. After all, I wanted next Dark Lord I young Slytherin."  This time laughter much widespread.  "Well, House ambitious, all," Professor Quirrell said, smiling. "I realize later I really enjoyed Battle Magic, true ambition become great fighting wizard someday teach Hogwarts. In case, I thirteen years old, I read historical sections Hogwarts library, scrutinizing lives fates past Dark Lords, I made list mistakes I would never make I Dark Lord -"  Harry giggled could stop himself.  "Yes, Mr. Potter, amusing. So, Mr. Potter, guess first item list?"  Great. "Um... never use complicated way dealing enemy Abracadabra them?"  "The term, Mr. Potter, Avada Kedavra," Professor Quirrell's voice sounded bit sharp reason, "and no, list I made age thirteen. Would care guess again?"  "Ah... never brag anyone evil master plan?"  Professor Quirrell laughed. "Ah, number two. My, Mr. Potter, reading books?"  There laughter, undertone nervousness. Harry clenched jaw tightly shut said nothing. A denial would accomplish nothing.  "But no. The first item was, 'I go around provoking strong, vicious enemies.' The history world would different Mornelithe Falconsbane Hitler grasped elementary point. Now if, Mr. Potter - chance harbor ambition similar one I held young Slytherin - even so, I hope ambition become stupid Dark Lord."  "Professor Quirrell," Harry said, gritting teeth, "I Ravenclaw ambition stupid, period. I know I today dumb. But Dark! I one threw first punch fight!"  "You, Mr. Potter, idiot. But I age. Thus I anticipated answer altered today's lesson plan accordingly. Mr. Gregory Goyle, would come forward, please?"  There surprised pause classroom. Harry expecting that.  Neither, looks it, Mr. Goyle, looked rather uncertain worried mounted marble stage approached dais.  Professor Quirrell straightened leaning desk. He looked suddenly stronger, hands formed fists drew clearly recognizable martial arts stance.  Harry's eyes widened sight, realized Mr. Goyle called up.  "Most wizards," Professor Quirrell said, "do bother much Muggle would term martial arts. Is wand stronger fist? This attitude stupid. Wands held fists. If want great fighting wizard must learn martial arts level would impress even Muggle. I demonstrate certain vitally important technique, I learned dojo, Muggle school martial arts, I shall speak shortly. For now..." Professor Quirrell took several steps forward, still stance, advancing Mr. Goyle stood. "Mr. Goyle, I ask attack me."  "Professor Quirrell," said Mr. Goyle, voice amplified professor's was, "can I ask level -"  "Sixth dan. You hurt neither I. And see opening, please take it."  Mr. Goyle nodded, looking much relieved.  "Note," Professor Quirrell said, "that Mr. Goyle afraid attack someone know martial arts acceptable level, fear I, he, would hurt. Mr. Goyle's attitude exactly correct earned three Quirrell points it. Now, fight!"  The young boy blurred forward, fists flying, Professor blocked every blow, dancing backward, Quirrell kicked Goyle blocked spun tried trip Quirrell sweeping leg Quirrell hopped happening fast Harry make sense going Goyle back legs pushing Quirrell actually flying air hit ground shoulder first rolled.  "Stop!" cried Professor Quirrell ground, sounding little panicked. "You win!"  Mr. Goyle pulled sharply staggered, almost tripping falling aborted momentum headlong charge toward Professor Quirrell. His face showed utter shock.  Professor Quirrell arched back bounced feet using peculiar springing motion made use hands.  There silence classroom, silence born total confusion.  "Mr. Goyle," said Professor Quirrell, "what vitally important technique I demonstrate?"  "How fall correctly someone throws you," said Mr. Goyle. "It's one first lessons learn -"  "That too," said Professor Quirrell.  There pause.  "The vitally important technique I demonstrated," said Professor Quirrell, "was lose. You may go, Mr. Goyle, thank you."  Mr. Goyle walked platform, looking rather bewildered. Harry felt way.  Professor Quirrell walked back desk resumed leaning it. "Sometimes forget basic things, since long since learned them. I realized I done lesson plan. You teach students throw taught fall. And I must teach fight understand lose."  Professor Quirrell's face hardened, Harry thought saw hint pain, touch sorrow, eyes. "I learned lose dojo Asia, which, Muggle knows, good martial artists live. This dojo taught style reputation among fighting wizards adapting well magical dueling. The Master dojo - old man Muggle standards - style's greatest living teacher. He idea magic existed, course. I applied study there, one students accepted year, among many contenders. There might tiny bit special influence involved."  There laughter classroom. Harry share it. That right all.  "In case. During one first fights, I beaten particularly humiliating fashion, I lost control attacked sparring partner -"  Yikes.  "- thankfully fists, rather magic. The Master, surprisingly, expel spot. But told flaw temperament. He explained me, I knew right. And said I would learn lose."  Professor Quirrell's face expressionless.  "Upon strict orders, students dojo lined up. One one, approached me. I defend myself. I beg mercy. One one, slapped me, punched me, pushed ground. Some spat me. They called awful names language. And one, I say, 'I lose!' similar things, 'I beg stop!' 'I admit better me!'"  Harry trying imagine simply failing. There way something like could happened dignified Professor Quirrell.  "I prodigy Battle Magic even then. With wandless magic alone I could killed everyone dojo. I so. I learned lose. To day I remember one unpleasant hours life. And I left dojo eight months later - nearly enough time, I could afford spend - Master told hoped I understood necessary. And I told one valuable lessons I ever learned. Which was, is, true."  Professor Quirrell's face turned bitter. "You wondering marvelous dojo is, whether study there. You cannot. For long afterward, another would-be student came hidden place, remote mountain. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named."  There sound many breaths drawn simultaneously. Harry felt sick stomach. He knew coming.  "The Dark Lord came school openly, without disguise, glowing red eyes all. The students tried bar way simply Apparated through. There terror there, discipline, Master came forth. And Dark Lord demanded - asked, demanded - taught."  Professor Quirrell's face hard. "Perhaps Master read many books telling lie true martial artist could defeat even demons. For whatever reason, Master refused. The Dark Lord asked could student. The Master told patience, Dark Lord ripped tongue out."  There collective gasp.  "You guess happened next. The students tried rush Dark Lord fell over, stunned stood. And then..."  Professor Quirrell's voice faltered moment, resumed.  "There Unforgiveable Curse, Cruciatus Curse, produces unbearable pain. If Cruciatus extended longer minutes produces permanent insanity. One one, Dark Lord Crucioed Master's students insanity, finished Killing Curse, Master forced watch. When students died way, Master followed. I learned single surviving student, Dark Lord left alive tell tale, friend mine..."  Professor Quirrell turned away, turned back moment later, seemed calm composed.  "Dark Wizards cannot keep tempers," Professor Quirrell said quietly. "It nearly universal flaw species, anyone makes habit fighting soon learns rely it. Understand Dark Lord win day. His goal learn martial arts, yet left without single lesson. The Dark Lord foolish wish story retold. It show strength, rather exploitable weakness."  Professor Quirrell's gaze focused single child classroom.  "Harry Potter," Professor Quirrell said.  "Yes," Harry said, voice hoarse.  "What precisely wrong today, Mr. Potter?"  Harry felt like going throw up. "I lost temper."  "That precise," said Professor Quirrell. "I describe exactly. There many animals called dominance contests. They rush horns - trying knock down, gore other. They fight paws - claws sheathed. But claws sheathed? Surely, used claws, would stand better chance winning? But enemy might unsheathe claws well, instead resolving dominance contest winner loser, might severely hurt."  Professor Quirrell gaze seemed come straight Harry repeater screen. "What demonstrated today, Mr. Potter, - unlike animals keep claws sheathed accept results - know lose dominance contest. When Hogwarts professor challenged you, back down. When looked like might lose, unsheathed claws, heedless danger. You escalated, escalated again. It started slap Professor Snape, obviously dominant you. Instead losing, slapped back lost ten points Ravenclaw. Soon talking leaving Hogwarts. The fact escalated even unknown direction, somehow end, change fact idiot."  "I understand," Harry said. His throat dry. That precise. Frighteningly precise. Now Professor Quirrell said it, Harry could see hindsight exactly accurate description happened. When someone's model good, wonder whether right things too, like intent kill.  "The next time, Mr. Potter, choose escalate contest rather lose, may lose stakes place table. I cannot guess today. I guess far, far high loss ten House points."  Like fate magical Britain. That he'd done.  ''You protest trying help Hogwarts, much important goal worthy great risks. That lie. If -"  "I would taken slap, waited, picked best possible time make move," Harry said, voice hoarse. "But would meant losing. Letting dominant me. It Dark Lord Master wanted learn from."  Professor Quirrell nodded. "I see understood perfectly. And so, Mr. Potter, today going learn lose."  "I -"  "I hear objections, Mr. Potter. It evident need strong enough take it. I assure experience harsh I went through, though may well remember worst fifteen minutes young life."  Harry swallowed. "Professor Quirrell," said small voice, "can time?"  "No," Professor Quirrell said simply. "You five days Hogwarts education already happened. Today Friday. Our next defense class Wednesday. Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday... No, time wait."  There laughs this, few.  "Please consider order professor, Mr. Potter. What I would like say otherwise I teach offensive spells, I would hear severely hurt even killed someone. Unfortunately I told fingers already powerful weapons. Do snap time lesson."  More scattered laughter, sounding rather nervous.  Harry felt like might cry. "Professor Quirrell, anything like talked about, going make angry, I really would rather get angry today -"  "The point avoid getting angry," Professor Quirrell said, face looking grave. "Anger natural. You need learn lose even angry. Or least pretend lose plan vengeance. As I Mr. Goyle today, unless course think really better -"  "I'm not!" shouted Mr. Goyle desk, sounding little frantic. "I know really lose! Please plan vengeances!"  Harry felt sick stomach. Professor Quirrell know mysterious dark side. "Professor, really need talk class -"  "We will," Professor Quirrell said tones promise. "After learn lose." His face serious. "It go without saying I exclude anything could injure even cause significant pain. The pain come difficulty losing, instead fighting back escalating battle win."  Harry's breath coming short, panicky pants. He frightened he'd leaving Potions classroom. "Professor Quirrell," managed say, "I want get fired -"  "I be," Professor Quirrell said, "if tell afterward necessary. And I trust do." For moment Professor Quirrell's voice turned dry. "Believe me, tolerated worse hallways. This case exceptional happens within classroom."  "Professor Quirrell," Harry whispered, thought voice still repeated everywhere, "do really believe I this, I might hurt someone?"  "Yes," Professor Quirrell said simply.  "Then," Harry felt nauseous, "I'll it."  Professor Quirrell turned regard Slytherins. "So... full approval teacher, fashion Snape cannot blamed actions... wish show dominance Boy-Who-Lived? Shove around, push ground, hear beg mercy?"  Five hands went up.  "Everyone hand raised, absolute idiot. What part pretending lose understand? If Harry Potter become next Dark Lord hunt kill graduates."  The five hands dropped abruptly back desks.  "I won't," Harry said, voice coming rather weakly. "I swear never take vengeance upon help learn lose. Professor Quirrell... would please... stop that?"  Professor Quirrell sighed. "I sorry, Mr. Potter. I realize must find equally annoying whether intend become Dark Lord not. But children also important life lesson learn. Would acceptable I awarded Quirrell point apology?"  "Make two," Harry said.  There current surprised laughter, defusing tension.  "Done," Professor Quirrell said.  "And I graduate I'm going hunt tickle you."  There laughter, although Professor Quirrell smile.  Harry felt like wrestling anaconda, trying force conversation narrow course would make people realize Dark Lord all... Professor Quirrell suspicious him?  "Professor," said Draco's unamplified voice. "It also ambition become stupid Dark Lord."  There shocked silence classroom.  You this! Harry almost blurted loud, checked time; Draco might wish known friendship Harry... desire appear friendly...  Calling desire appear friendly made Harry feel small, mean. If Draco intended impress him, working perfectly.  Professor Quirrell regarding Draco gravely. "You worry cannot pretend lose, Mr. Malfoy? That flaw describes Mr. Potter also describes you? Surely father taught better."  "When comes talking, maybe," said Draco, repeater screen. "Not comes shoved around pushed ground. I want fully strong you, Professor Quirrell."  Professor Quirrell's eyebrows went stayed up. "I afraid, Mr. Malfoy," said time, "that arrangements I made Mr. Potter, involving older Slytherins told afterward stupid were, would carry onto you. But professional opinion already strong. Should I hear failed, Mr. Potter failed today, I make appropriate arrangements apologize whomever hurt. I think necessary, however."  "I understand, professor," said Draco.  Professor Quirrell looked class. "Does anyone else wish become strong?"  Some students glanced around nervously. Some, Harry thought back row, looked like opening mouths saying anything. In end, one spoke.  "Draco Malfoy one generals year's armies," said Professor Quirrell, "should deign engage after-school activity. And now, Mr. Potter, please come forward."   Yes, Professor Quirrell said, must front everyone, front friends, Snape confronted must learn lose.  So first year watched. In magically enforced silence, requests Harry professor intervene. Hermione face turned away, spoken even given sort significant look, maybe she'd Potions too.  Harry stood soft blue mat, might found Muggle dojo, Professor Quirrell laid upon floor Harry pushed down.  Harry frightened might do. If Professor Quirrell right intent kill...  Harry's wand lay Professor Quirrell's desk, Harry knew spells could defend him, otherwise (Harry thought) might tried jam someone's eye socket. His pouch lay there, containing protected still potentially fragile Time-Turner.  Harry pleaded Professor Quirrell Transfigure boxing gloves lock hands. Professor Quirrell given look silent understanding, refused.  I go eyes, I go eyes, I go eyes, would end life Hogwarts, I'll arrested, Harry chanted himself, trying hammer thought brain, hoping would stay intent kill took over.  Professor Quirrell returned, escorting thirteen older Slytherins different years. Harry recognized one one he'd hit pie. Two others confrontation also present. The one who'd said stop, really this, missing.  "I repeat," Professor Quirrell said, sounding stern, "Potter really hurt. Any accidents treated deliberate. Do understand?"  The older Slytherins nodded, grinning.  "Then please feel free take Boy-Who-Lived pegs," Professor Quirrell said, twisted smile first-years understood.  By form mutual consent, pie-target front group.  "Potter," said Professor Quirrell, "meet Mr. Peregrine Derrick. He better show that."  Derrick strode forward Harry's brain screamed discordantly, must run away, must fight back -  Derrick stopped arm's length away Harry.  Harry angry yet, frightened. And meant beheld teenage boy fully half meter taller himself, clearly defined muscles, facial hair, grin terrible anticipation.  "Ask hurt you," Professor Quirrell said. "Perhaps sees pathetic enough, he'll decide boring, go away."  There laughter watching older Slytherins.  "Please," Harry said, voice faltering, "don't, hurt, me..."  "That sound sincere," said Professor Quirrell.  Derrick's smile widened. The clumsy imbecile looking superior and...  ...Harry's blood temperature dropping...  "Please hurt me," Harry tried again.  Professor Quirrell shook head. "How Merlin's name manage make sound like insult, Potter? There one response possibly expect Mr. Derrick."  Derrick stepped forward deliberately, bumped Harry.  Harry staggered back feet and, could stop himself, straightened icily.  "Wrong," said Professor Quirrell, "wrong, wrong, wrong."  "You bumped me, Potter," Derrick said. "Apologize."  "I'm sorry!"  "You sound sorry," said Derrick.  Harry's eyes widened indignation, managed make sound pleading -  Derrick pushed him, hard, Harry fell mat hands knees.  The blue fabric seemed waver Harry's vision, far away.  He beginning doubt Professor Quirrell's real motives teaching so-called lesson.  A foot rested Harry's buttocks moment later Harry pushed hard side, sending sprawling back.  Derrick laughed. "This fun," said.  All say over. And report whole thing Headmaster's office. That would end Defense Professor ill-fated stay Hogwarts and... Professor McGonagall would angry that, but...  (An image Professor McGonagall's face flashed eyes, look angry, sad -)  "Now tell he's better you, Potter," said Professor Quirrell's voice.  "You're, better, than, me."  Harry started raise Derrick put foot chest shoved back mat.  The world becoming transparent crystal. Lines action consequences stretched utter clarity. The fool expecting strike back, quick hit groin would stun long enough -  "Try again," said Professor Quirrell sudden sharp motion Harry rolled sprang feet whirled stood real enemy, Defense Professor -  Professor Quirrell said, "You patience."  Harry faltered. His mind, well-honed pessimism, drew picture wizened old man blood pouring mouth Harry ripped tongue -  A moment later, Derrick pushed Harry mat sat him, sending Harry's breath whooshing out.  "Stop!" Harry screamed. "Please stop!"  "Better," said Professor Quirrell. "That even sounded sincere."  It been. That horrible thing, sickening thing, sincere. Harry panting rapidly, fear cold anger flushing -  "Lose," said Professor Quirrell.  "I, lose," Harry forced out.  "I like it," Derrick said top him. "Lose more."   Hands shoved Harry, sending stumbling across circle older Slytherins another set hands shoved again. Harry long since passed point trying cry, trying fall down.  "What you, Potter?" said Derrick.  "A, l-loser, I lose, I give up, win, b-better, me, please stop -"  Harry tripped foot went crashing ground, hands quite able catch himself. He dazed moment, began struggling feet -  "Enough!" said Professor Quirrell's voice, sounding sharp enough cut iron. "Step away Mr. Potter!"  Harry saw surprised looks faces. The chill blood, flowing ebbing, smiled cold satisfaction.  Then Harry collapsed mat.  Professor Quirrell talked. There gasps older Slytherins.  "And I believe scion Malfoy something wants explain well," finished Professor Quirrell.  Draco's voice started talking. His voice sounded almost sharp professor Quirrell's, acquired cadence Draco used imitate father, saying things like could put Slytherin House jeopardy knows many allies school alone total lack awareness, never mind cunning dull thugs, useful nothing lackeys something Harry's hindbrain, despite everything knew, designating Draco ally.  Harry ached over, probably bruised, body felt cold, mind utterly exhausted. He tried think Fawkes's song, without phoenix present remember melody tried imagine seem think anything except bird chirping.  Then Draco stopped talking Professor Quirrell told older Slytherins dismissed, Harry opened eyes struggled sit up, "Wait," Harry said, forcing words out, "there's something, I want, say, -"  "Wait Mr. Potter," Professor Quirrell said coldly departing Slytherins.  Harry swayed feet. He careful look direction classmates. He want see looking now. He want see pity.  So instead Harry looked older Slytherins, still seemed state shock. They stared back him. Dread faces.  His dark side, control, held imagination moment, went pretending lose.  Harry said, "No one -"  "Stop," said Professor Quirrell. "If that's I think is, please wait they're gone. They'll hear later. We lessons learn, Mr. Potter."  "All right," Harry said.  "You. Go."  The older Slytherins fled door closed behind them.  "No one's take revenge them," Harry said hoarsely. "That's request anyone considers friend. I lesson learn, helped learn it, lesson learn too, over. If tell story, make sure tell part too."  Harry turned look Professor Quirrell.  "You lost," said Professor Quirrell, voice gentle first time. It sounded strange coming professor, like voice even able that.  Harry lost. There moments cold anger faded entirely, replaced fear, moments he'd begged older Slytherins he'd meant it...  "And yet alive?" said Professor Quirrell, still strange gentleness.  Harry managed nod.  "Not losing like this," said Professor Quirrell. "There compromises negotiated surrenders. There ways placate bullies. There whole art form manipulating others letting dominant you. But first, losing must thinkable. Will remember lost?"  "Yes."  "Will able lose?"  "I... think so..."  "I think too." Professor Quirrell bowed low thin hair almost touched floor. "Congratulations, Harry Potter, win."  There single source, first mover, applause started like massive thunderclap.  Harry's keep shock face. He risked glance classmates, saw faces showing pity awe. The applause coming Ravenclaw Gryffindor Hufflepuff even Slytherin, probably Draco Malfoy applauding too. Some students standing chairs half Gryffindor standing desks.  So Harry stood there, swaying, letting respect wash him, feeling stronger, maybe even little healed.  Professor Quirrell waited applause die away. It took quite while.  "Surprised, Mr. Potter?" Professor Quirrell said. His voice sounded amused. "You found real world always work like worst nightmares. Yes, poor anonymous boy abused, would probably respected less afterward, pitied even comforted loftier perches. That human nature, I'm afraid. But already know figure power. And saw confront fear keep confronting it, even though could walked away time. Did think less I told I deliberately endured spat upon?"  Harry felt burning sensation throat frantically clamped down. He trust miraculous respect enough start crying front it.  "Your extraordinary achievement class deserves extraordinary reward, Harry Potter. Please accept compliments behalf House, remember day forward Slytherins alike. There Slytherins, Slytherins." Professor Quirrell smiling quite broadly said this. "Fifty-one points Ravenclaw."  There shocked pause pandemonium broke among Ravenclaw students, howling whistling cheering.  (And moment Harry felt something wrong that, Professor McGonagall right, consequences, cost price paid, put everything back way like -)  But Harry saw elated faces Ravenclaw knew possibly say no.  His brain made suggestion. It good suggestion. Harry could even believe brain still keeping upright, let alone producing good suggestions.  "Professor Quirrell," Harry said, clearly could burning throat. "You everything member House be, I think must Salazar Slytherin mind helped found Hogwarts. I thank House," Draco slightly nodding subtly turning finger, keep going, "and I think calls three cheers Slytherin. With me, everyone?" Harry paused. "Huzzah!" Only people managed join first try. "Huzzah!" This time Ravenclaw it. "Huzzah!" That almost Ravenclaw, scattering Hufflepuffs around quarter Gryffindor.  Draco's hand moved small, quick, thumbs-up gesture.  Most Slytherins expressions sheer shock. A staring Professor Quirrell wonder. Blaise Zabini looking Harry calculating, intrigued expression.  Professor Quirrell bowed. "Thank you, Harry Potter," said, still broad smile. He turned class. "Now, believe not, still half hour left session, enough introduce Simple Shield. Mr. Potter, course, going taking well-earned rest."  "I -"  "Idiot," Professor Quirrell said fondly. The class already laughing. "Your classmates teach afterward, I'll tutor privately that's takes. But right now, going third door left back stage, find bed, assortment exceptionally tasty snacks, extremely light reading Hogwarts library. You may take anything else you, particularly textbooks. Now go."  Harry went.   Chapter 20: Bayes's Theorem  That destroyed Rowling be.   Harry stared gray ceiling small room, lay portable yet soft bed placed there. He'd eaten quite lot Professor Quirrell's snacks - intricate confections chocolate substances, dusted sparkling sprinkles jeweled tiny sugar gems, looking highly expensive proving, fact, quite tasty. Harry felt least bit guilty either, earned.  He tried sleep. Harry feeling like happened closed eyes.  He tried read. He able focus.  Funny Harry's brain seemed keep running running, never shutting matter tired got. It got stupider refused switch off.  But was, really truly feeling triumph.  Anti-Dark-Lord-Harry program, +1 point begin cover it. Harry wondered Sorting Hat would say now, could put head.  No wonder Professor Quirrell accused Harry heading path Dark Lord. Harry slow uptake, seen parallel right away -  Understand Dark Lord win day. His goal learn martial arts, yet left without single lesson.  Harry entered Potions class intent learn Potions. He'd left without single lesson.  And Professor Quirrell heard, understood frightening precision, reached yanked Harry path, path led becoming copy You-Know-Who.  There knock door. "Classes over," said Professor Quirrell's quiet voice.  Harry approached door found suddenly nervous. Then tension diminished heard Professor Quirrell's footsteps moving away door.  What Earth about? Is what's going get fired eventually?  Harry opened door, saw Professor Quirrell waiting several bodylengths away.  Does Professor Quirrell feel too?  They walked across now-deserted stage Professor Quirrell's desk, Professor Quirrell leaned on; Harry, before, stopped short dais.  "So," Professor Quirrell said. There friendly sense somehow, even though face still kept usual seriousness. "What wanted talk about, Mr. Potter?"  I mysterious dark side. But Harry blurt like that.  "Professor Quirrell," Harry said, "am I path becoming Dark Lord, now?"  Professor Quirrell looked Harry. "Mr. Potter," said solemnly, slight grin, "a word advice. There thing performance perfect. Real people beaten humiliated fifteen minutes stand graciously forgive enemies. It sort thing trying convince everyone Dark, -"  "I can't believe this! You can't every possible observation confirm theory!"  "And trifle much indignation."  "What Earth I to convince you?"  "To convince harbor ambitions becoming Dark Lord?" said Professor Quirrell, looking outright amused. "I suppose could raise right hand."  "What?" Harry said blankly. "But I raise right hand whether I -" Harry stopped, feeling rather stupid.  "Indeed," said Professor Quirrell. "You easily either way. There nothing convince I would know exactly trying do. And even precise, I suppose barely possible perfectly good people exist even though I never met one, nonetheless improbable someone would beaten fifteen minutes stand feel great surge kindly forgiveness attackers. On hand less improbable young child would imagine role play order convince teacher classmates next Dark Lord. The import act lies act resembles surface, Mr. Potter, states mind make act less probable."  Harry blinked. He'd dichotomy representativeness heuristic Bayesian definition evidence explained wizard.  "But again," said Professor Quirrell, "anyone want impress friends. That need Dark. So without kind admission, Mr. Potter, tell honestly. What thought mind moment forbade vengeance? Was thought true impulse forgiveness? Or awareness classmates would see act?"  Sometimes make phoenix song.  But Harry say loud. It clear Professor Quirrell believe him, would probably respect less trying utter transparent lie.  After moments silence, Professor Quirrell smiled satisfaction. "Believe not, Mr. Potter," said professor, "you need fear discovered secret. I going tell give becoming next Dark Lord. If I could turn back hands time somehow remove ambition mind child self, self present time would benefit alteration. For long I thought goal, drove study learn refine become stronger. We become meant following desires wherever lead. That insight Salazar. Ask show library section holds books I read thirteen-year-old, I happily lead way."  "For love crap," Harry said, sat hard marble floor, lay back floor, staring distant arches ceiling. It close could come collapsing despair without hurting himself.  "Still much indignation," observed Professor Quirrell. Harry looking could hear suppressed laughter voice.  Then Harry realized.  "Actually, I think I know what's confusing here," Harry said. "That I wanted talk about, fact. Professor Quirrell, I think seeing mysterious dark side."  There pause.  "Your... dark side..."  Harry sat up. Professor Quirrell regarding one strangest expressions Harry seen anyone's face, let alone anyone dignified Professor Quirrell.  "It happens I get angry," Harry explained. "My blood runs cold, everything gets cold, everything seems perfectly clear... In retrospect - first year Muggle school, someone tried take away ball recess I held behind back kicked solar plexus I'd read weak point, kids bother that. And I bit math teacher accept dominance. But recently I've enough stress notice actual, know, mysterious dark side, anger management problem like school psychologist said. And I super magical powers happens, one first things I checked."  Professor Quirrell rubbed nose. "Let think this," said.  Harry waited silence full minute. He used time stand up, difficult expected.  "Well," Professor Quirrell said while. "I suppose something could say would convince me."  "I already guessed dark side really another part answer never become angry learn stay control accepting it, I'm dumb anything I've seen story enough times know going, hard seem like person help me."  "Well... yes... perspicacious you, Mr. Potter, I must say... side is, seem already surmised, intent kill, say part you..."  "And needs trained," Harry said, completing pattern.  "And needs trained, yes." That strange expression still Professor Quirrell's face. "Mr. Potter, truly wish next Dark Lord, ambition Sorting Hat tried convince abandon, ambition Sorted Slytherin?"  "I Sorted Ravenclaw!"  "Mr. Potter," said Professor Quirrell, much usual-looking dry smile, "I know accustomed everyone around fool, please mistake one them. The likelihood Sorting Hat would play first prank eight hundred years upon head small worth considering. I suppose barely possible snapped fingers invented simple clever way defeat anti-tampering spells upon Hat, though I think method. But far probable explanation Dumbledore decided happy Hat's choice Boy-Who-Lived. This evident anyone tiniest smidgin common sense, secret safe Hogwarts."  Harry opened mouth, closed feeling complete helplessness. Professor Quirrell wrong, wrong convincing way Harry starting think simply rational judgment given evidence available Professor Quirrell. There times, never predictable times still sometimes, would get improbable evidence best knowable guess would wrong. If medical test wrong one time thousand, sometimes would still wrong anyway.  "Can I ask never repeat I'm say?" said Harry.  "Absolutely," said Professor Quirrell. "Consider asked."  Harry fool either. "Can I consider said yes?"  "Very good, Mr. Potter. You may indeed consider."  "Professor Quirrell -"  "I repeat say," Professor Quirrell said, smiling.  They laughed, Harry turned serious again. "The Sorting Hat seem think I going end Dark Lord unless I went Hufflepuff," Harry said. "But I want one."  "Mr. Potter..." said Professor Quirrell. "Don't take wrong way. I promise graded answer. I want know own, honest reply. Why not?"  Harry helpless feeling again. Thou shalt become Dark Lord obvious theorem moral system hard describe actual proof steps. "Um, people would get hurt?"  "Surely wanted hurt people," said Professor Quirrell. "You wanted hurt bullies today. Being Dark Lord means people want hurt get hurt."  Harry floundered words decided simply go obvious. "First all, I want hurt someone mean right -"  "What makes something right, wanting it?"  "Ah," Harry said, "preference utilitarianism."  "Pardon me?" said Professor Quirrell.  "It's ethical theory good satisfies preferences people -"  "No," Professor Quirrell said. His fingers rubbed bridge nose. "I think that's quite I trying say. Mr. Potter, end people want do. Sometimes people give names like 'right' things want do, could possibly act anything desires?"  "Well, obviously," Harry said. "I act moral considerations lacked power move me. But mean wanting hurt Slytherins power move moral considerations!"  Professor Quirrell blinked.  "Not mention," Harry said, "being Dark Lord would mean lot innocent bystanders got hurt too!"  "Why matter you?" Professor Quirrell said. "What done you?"  Harry laughed. "Oh, around subtle Atlas Shrugged."  "Pardon me?" Professor Quirrell said again.  "It's book parents let read thought would corrupt me, course I read anyway I offended thought I would fall traps obvious. Blah blah blah, appeal sense superiority, people trying keep down, blah blah blah."  "So saying I need make traps less obvious?" said Professor Quirrell. He tapped finger cheek, looking thoughtful. "I work that."  They laughed.  "But stay current question," said Professor Quirrell, "what people done you?"  "Other people done huge amounts me!" Harry said. "My parents took parents died good people, become Dark Lord betray that!"  Professor Quirrell silent time.  "I confess," said Professor Quirrell quietly, "when I age, thought could ever come me."  "I'm sorry," Harry said.  "Don't be," said Professor Quirrell. "It long ago, I resolved parental issues satisfaction. So held back thought parents' disapproval? Does mean died accident, would nothing left stop -"  "No," Harry said. "Just no. It impulse kindness sheltered me. That impulse parents. And impulse would betrayed."  "In case, Mr. Potter, answered original question," said Professor Quirrell finally. "What ambition?"  "Oh," said Harry. "Um.." He organized thoughts. "To understand everything important know universe, apply knowledge become omnipotent, use power rewrite reality I objections way works now."  There slight pause.  "Forgive stupid question, Mr. Potter," said Professor Quirrell, "but sure confess wanting Dark Lord?"  "That's use power evil," explained Harry. "If use power good, Light Lord."  "I see," Professor Quirrell said. He tapped cheek finger. "I suppose I work that. But Mr. Potter, scope ambition worthy Salazar himself, exactly propose go it? Is step one become great fighting wizard, Head Unspeakable, Minister Magic, -"  "Step one become scientist."  Professor Quirrell looking Harry he'd turned cat.  "A scientist," Professor Quirrell said while.  Harry nodded.  "A scientist?" repeated Professor Quirrell.  "Yes," Harry said. "I shall achieve objectives power... Science!"  "A scientist!" said Professor Quirrell. There genuine indignation face, voice grown stronger sharper. "You could best students! The greatest fighting wizard come Hogwarts five decades! I cannot picture wasting days white lab coat pointless things rats!"  "Hey!" said Harry. "There's science that! Not there's anything wrong experimenting rats, course. But science go understanding controlling universe -"  "Fool," said Professor Quirrell, voice quiet, bitter intensity. "You're fool, Harry Potter." He passed hand face, hand passed, face calmer. "Or likely yet found true ambition. May I strongly recommend try become Dark Lord instead? I anything I help matter public service."  "You like science," Harry said slowly. "Why not?"  "Those fool Muggles kill us someday!" Professor Quirrell's voice grown louder. "They end it! End it!"  Harry feeling bit lost here. "What talking here, nuclear weapons?"  "Yes, nuclear weapons!" Professor Quirrell almost shouting now. "Even He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named never used those, perhaps want rule heap ash! They never made! And get worse time!" Professor Quirrell standing straight instead leaning desk. "There gates open, seals breach! The fools can't resist meddling killed lesser perils early on, survivors know secrets share anyone lacks intelligence discipline discover themselves! Every powerful wizard knows that! Even terrible Dark Wizards know that! And idiot Muggles can't seem figure out! The eager little fools discovered secret nuclear weapons keep themselves, told fool politicians must live constant threat annihilation!"  This rather different way looking things Harry grown with. It never occurred nuclear physicists formed conspiracy silence keep secret nuclear weapons anyone smart enough nuclear physicist. The thought intriguing, nothing else. Would secret passwords? Would masks?  (Actually, Harry knew, sorts incredibly destructive secrets physicists kept themselves, secret nuclear weapons one escaped wild. The world would look either way.)  "I'll think that," Harry said Professor Quirrell. "It's new idea me. And one hidden secrets science, passed rare teachers grad students, avoid flushing new ideas toilet instant hear one like."  Professor Quirrell blinked again.  "Is sort science approve of?" said Harry. "Medicine, maybe?"  "Space travel," said Professor Quirrell. "But Muggles seem dragging feet one project might let wizardkind escape planet blow up."  Harry nodded. "I'm big fan space program too. At least much common."  Professor Quirrell looked Harry. Something flickered professor's eyes. "I word, promise oath never speak follows."  "You it," Harry said immediately.  "See keep oath like results," said Professor Quirrell. "I cast rare powerful spell, you, classroom around us. Stand still, touch boundaries spell cast. You must interact magic I maintaining. Look only. Otherwise I end spell." Professor Quirrell paused. "And try fall over."  Harry nodded, puzzled anticipatory.  Professor Quirrell raised wand said something Harry's ears mind grasp all, words bypassed awareness vanished oblivion.  The marble short radius around Harry's feet stayed constant. All marble floor vanished, walls ceilings vanished.  Harry stood small circle white marble midst endless field stars, burning terribly bright unwavering. There Earth, Moon, Sun Harry recognized. Professor Quirrell stood place before, floating midst starfield. The Milky Way already visible great wash light grew brighter Harry's vision adjusted darkness.  The sight wrenched Harry's heart like nothing ever seen.  "Are we... space...?"  "No," said Professor Quirrell. His voice sad, reverent. "But true image."  Tears came Harry's eyes. He wiped away frantically, would miss stupid water blurring vision.  The stars longer tiny jewels set giant velvet dome, night sky Earth. Here sky above, surrounding sphere. Only points perfect light perfect blackness, infinite empty void countless tiny holes shone brilliance unimaginable realm beyond.  In space, stars looked terribly, terribly, terribly far away.  Harry kept wiping eyes, over.  "Sometimes," Professor Quirrell said voice quiet almost there, "when flawed world seems unusually hateful, I wonder whether might place, far away, I been. I cannot seem imagine place might be, I can't even imagine I believe exists? And yet universe very, wide, perhaps might exist anyway? But stars very, far away. It would take long, long time get there, even I knew way. And I wonder I would dream about, I slept long, long time..."  Though felt like sacrilege, Harry managed whisper. "Please let stay awhile."  Professor Quirrell nodded, stood unsupported stars.  It easy forget small circle marble stood, body, become point awareness might still, might moving. With distances incalculable way tell.  There time time.  And stars vanished, classroom returned.  "I'm sorry," said Professor Quirrell, "but we're company."  "It's fine," Harry whispered. "It enough." He would never forget day, unimportant things happened earlier. He would learn cast spell last thing ever learned.  Then heavy oaken doors classroom blasted hinges skittered across marble floor high-pitched shriek.  "QUIRINUS! HOW DARE YOU!"  Like vast thundercloud, ancient powerful wizard blew room, look incandescent rage upon face stern look earlier turned upon Harry seemed like nothing.  There wrench disorientation Harry's mind part wanted run away screaming scariest thing ever seen ran away, rotating place part could take shock.  None Harry's facets happy star-gazing interrupted. "Headmaster Albus Percival -" Harry started say icy tones.  WHAM. Professor Quirrell's hand came hard upon desk. "Mr. Potter!" barked Professor Quirrell. "This Headmaster Hogwarts mere student! You address appropriately!"  Harry looked Professor Quirrell.  Professor Quirrell giving Harry stern glare.  Neither smiled.  Dumbledore's long strides come halt Harry stood front dais Professor Quirrell stood desk. The Headmaster stared shock them.  "I'm sorry," Harry said meekly polite tones. "Headmaster, thank wanting protect me, Professor Quirrell right thing."  Slowly, Dumbledore's expression changed something would vaporize steel something merely angry. "I heard students saying man abused older Slytherins! That forbade defend yourself!"  Harry nodded. "He knew exactly wrong showed fix it."  "Harry, talking about?"  "I teaching lose," Professor Quirrell said dryly. "It's important life skill."  It apparent Dumbledore still understand, voice lowered register. "Harry..." said slowly. "If there's threat Defense Professor offered prevent complaining -"  You lunatic, today days really think I -  "Headmaster," Harry said, trying look abashed, "what's wrong I keep quiet abusive professors."  Professor Quirrell chuckled. "Not perfect, Mr. Potter, good enough first day. Headmaster, stay long enough hear fifty-one points Ravenclaw, storm soon heard first part?"  A brief look disconcertment crossed Dumbledore's face, followed surprise. "Fifty-one points Ravenclaw?"  Professor Quirrell nodded. "He expecting them, seemed appropriate. Tell Professor McGonagall I think story Mr. Potter went earn back lost points well make point. No, Headmaster, Mr. Potter tell anything. It's easy see part today's events work, I know final compromise suggestion. Though I wonder Earth Mr. Potter able gain upper hand Snape and Professor McGonagall able gain upper hand him."  Somehow Harry managed control face. Was obvious real Slytherin?  Dumbledore came closer Harry, scrutinizing. "Your color looks little off, Harry," old wizard said. He peered closely Harry's face. "What lunch today?"  "What?" Harry said, mind wobbling sudden confusion. Why would Dumbledore asking deep-fried lamb thin-sliced broccoli last probable cause -  The old wizard straightened up. "Never mind, then. I think fine."  Professor Quirrell coughed, loudly deliberately. Harry looked professor, saw Professor Quirrell staring sharply Dumbledore.  "Ah-hem!" Professor Quirrell said again.  Dumbledore Professor Quirrell locked eyes, something seemed pass them.  "If tell him," Professor Quirrell said then, "I will, even fire it."  Dumbledore sighed turned back Harry. "I apologize invading mental privacy, Mr. Potter," Headmaster said formally. "I purpose except determine Professor Quirrell done same."  What?  The confusion lasted exactly long took Harry understand happened.  "You - !"  "Gently, Mr. Potter," said Professor Quirrell. His face hard, however, stared Dumbledore.  "Legilimency sometimes mistaken common sense," said Headmaster. "But leaves traces another skillful Legilimens detect. That I looked for, Mr. Potter, I asked irrelevant question ensure think anything important I looked."  "You asked first!"  Professor Quirrell shook head. "No, Mr. Potter, Headmaster justification concerns, asked permission would thought exactly things wish see." Professor Quirrell's voice grew sharper. "I rather concerned, Headmaster, saw need tell afterward!"  "You made difficult confirm mental privacy future occasions," Dumbledore said. He favored Professor Quirrell cold look. "Was intention, I wonder?"  Professor Quirrell's expression implacable. "There many Legilimens school. I insist Mr. Potter receive instruction Occlumency. Will permit tutor?"  "Absolutely not," Dumbledore said once.  "I think so. Then since deprived free services, pay Mr. Potter's tutoring licensed Occlumency instructor."  "Such services come cheaply," Dumbledore said, looking Professor Quirrell surprise. "Although I certain connections -"  Professor Quirrell shook head firmly. "No. Mr. Potter ask account manager Gringotts recommend neutral instructor. With respect, Headmaster Dumbledore, events morning I must protest friends access Mr. Potter's mind. I must also insist instructor taken Unbreakable Vow reveal nothing, agree Obliviated session immediately afterward."  Dumbledore frowning. "Such services extremely expensive, well know, I cannot help wonder deem necessary."  "If money that's problem," Harry spoke up, "I ideas making large amounts money quickly -"  "Thank Quirinus, wisdom quite evident I sorry disputing it. Your concern Harry Potter credit, well."  "You're welcome," said Professor Quirrell. "I hope object I go making particular focus attentions." Professor Quirrell's face serious, still.  Dumbledore looked Harry.  "It wish also," Harry said.  "So that's be..." old wizard said slowly. Something strange passed across face. "Harry... must realize choose man teacher friend, first mentor, one way another lose him, manner lose may may allow ever get back."  That occurred Harry. But jinx Defense position... one apparently worked perfect regularity decades...  "Probably," said Professor Quirrell quietly, "but full use I last."  Dumbledore sighed. "I suppose economical, least, since Defense Professor already doomed unknown fashion."  Harry work hard suppress expression realized Dumbledore actually implying.  "I inform Madam Pince Mr. Potter allowed obtain books Occlumency," said Dumbledore.  "There preliminary training must own," said Professor Quirrell Harry. "And I suggest hurry it."  Harry nodded.  "I'll take leave then," said Dumbledore. He nodded Harry Professor Quirrell, departed, walking bit slowly.  "Can cast spell again?" Harry said moment Dumbledore gone.  "Not today," said Professor Quirrell quietly, "and tomorrow either, I'm afraid. It takes lot cast, though less keep going, I usually prefer maintain long possible. This time I cast impulse. Had I thought, realized might interrupted -"  Dumbledore Harry's least favorite person entire world.  They sighed.  "Even I ever see once," Harry said, "I never stop grateful you."  Professor Quirrell nodded.  "Have heard Pioneer program?" Harry said. "They probes would fly different planets take pictures. Two probes would end trajectories took Solar System interstellar space. So put golden plaque probes, picture man, woman, showing find Sun galaxy."  Professor Quirrell silent moment, smiled. "Tell me, Mr. Potter, guess thought went mind I finished assembling thirty-seven items list things I would never Dark Lord? Put shoes - imagine place - guess."  Harry imagined looking list thirty-seven things became Dark Lord.  "You decided follow whole list time, much point becoming Dark Lord first place," Harry said.  "Precisely," said Professor Quirrell. He grinning. "So I going violate rule two - simply 'don't brag' - tell something I done. I see knowledge could harm. And I strongly suspect would figured anyway, knew well enough. Nonetheless... I shall oath never speak I tell."  "You it!" Harry feeling going really good.  "I subscribe Muggle bulletin keeps informed progress space travel. I hear Pioneer 10 reported launch. But I discovered Pioneer 11 would also leaving Solar System forever," Professor Quirrell said, grin widest Harry yet seen him, "I snuck NASA, I did, I cast lovely little spell lovely golden plaque make last lot longer otherwise would."  ...  ...  ...  "Yes," Professor Quirrell said, seemed standing around fifty feet taller, "I thought might react."  ...  ...  ...  "Mr. Potter?"  "...I can't think anything say."  "'You win' seems appropriate," said Professor Quirrell.  "You win," Harry said immediately.  "See?" said Professor Quirrell. "We imagine giant heap trouble would gotten unable say that."  They laughed.  A thought occurred Harry. "You add extra information plaque, you?"  "Extra information?" said Professor Quirrell, sounding idea never occurred quite intrigued.  Which made Harry rather suspicious, considering it'd taken less minute Harry think it.  "Maybe included holographic message like Star Wars?" said Harry. "Or... hm. A portrait seems store whole human brain's worth information... added extra mass probe, maybe could've turned existing part portrait yourself? Or found volunteer dying terminal illness, snuck NASA, cast spell make sure ghost ended plaque -"  "Mr. Potter," Professor Quirrell said, voice suddenly sharp, "a spell requiring human death would certainly classified Ministry Dark Arts, regardless circumstances. Students heard talking things."  And amazing thing way Professor Quirrell said perfectly maintained plausible deniability. It said exactly appropriate tone someone willing discuss things thought students steer away them. Harry honestly know whether Professor Quirrell waiting talk Harry learned protect mind.  "Got it," Harry said. "I talk anyone else idea."  "Please discreet whole matter, Mr. Potter," Professor Quirrell said. "I prefer go life without attracting public notice. You find nothing newspapers Quirinus Quirrell I decided time teach Defense Hogwarts."  That seemed little sad, Harry understood. Then Harry realized implications. "So much awesome stuff done one else knows -"  "Oh, some," said Professor Quirrell. "But I think that's quite enough today, Mr. Potter, I confess I feeling bit tired -"  "I understand. And thank you. For everything."  Professor Quirrell nodded, leaning harder desk.  Harry quickly took leave.   Chapter 21: Rationalization  Rowling whoever Rowling's job.   Hermione Granger worried turning Bad.  The difference Good Bad usually easy grasp, she'd never understood people much trouble. At Hogwarts, "Good" Professor Flitwick Professor McGonagall Professor Sprout. "Bad" Professor Snape Professor Quirrell Draco Malfoy. Harry Potter... one unusual cases tell looking. She still trying figure belonged.  But came herself...  Hermione much fun crushing Harry Potter.  She'd done better every single class they'd taken. (Except broomstick riding like gym class, count.) She'd gotten real House points almost every day first week, weird heroic things, smart things like learning spells quickly helping students. She knew kinds House points better, best part was, Harry Potter knew too. She could see eyes every time another real House point.  If Good, supposed enjoy winning much.  It started day train ride, though taken whirlwind sink in. It later night Hermione begun realize much she'd let boy walk her.  Before she'd met Harry Potter anyone she'd wanted crush. If someone well class, job help them, rub in. That meant Good.  And now...  ...now winning, Harry Potter flinching every time got another House point, much fun, parents warned drugs suspected fun that.  She'd always liked smiles teachers gave something right. She'd always liked seeing long row check-marks perfectly answered test. But well class would casually glance around catch glimpse Harry Potter gritting teeth, made want burst song like Disney movie.  That Bad, it?  Hermione worried turning Bad.  And thought come wiped away fears.  She Harry getting Romance! Of course! Everyone knew meant boy girl started fighting time. They courting one another! There nothing Bad that.  It enjoyed beating living scholastic daylights famous student school, someone books talked like books, boy somehow vanquished Dark Lord even smushed Professor Snape like sad little bug, boy was, Professor Quirrell would put it, dominant, everyone else first-year Ravenclaw except Hermione Granger utterly squishing Boy-Who-Lived classes besides broomstick riding.  Because would Bad.  No. It Romance. That it. That fighting.  Hermione glad figured time today, Harry would lose book-reading contest, whole school knew about, wanted start dancing sheer overflowing joy it.  It 2:45pm Saturday Harry Potter half Bathilda Bagshot's A History Magic left read staring pocket watch ticked dreadful slowness toward 2:47pm.  And entire Ravenclaw common room watching.  It first-years, news spread like spilled milk fully half Ravenclaw crowded room, squeezed sofas leaning bookcases sitting arms chairs. All six prefects including Head Girl Hogwarts. Someone needed cast Air-Freshening Charm would enough oxygen. And din conversation died whispers faded utter silence.  2:46pm.  The tension unbearable. If anyone else, anyone else, defeat would foregone conclusion.  But Harry Potter, rule possibility would, sometime next seconds, raise hand snap fingers.  With sudden terror realized Harry Potter might able exactly that. It would like already finished reading second half book earlier...  Hermione's vision began swim. She tried make breathe, found simply couldn't.  Ten seconds left, still raised hand.  Five seconds left.  2:47pm.  Harry Potter carefully placed bookmark book, closed it, laid aside.  "I would like note benefit posterity," said Boy-Who-Lived clear voice, "that I half book left, I ran number unexpected delays -"  "You lost!" shrieked Hermione. "You did! You lost contest!"  There collective exhalation everyone started breathing again.  Harry Potter shot Look Flaming Fire, floating halo pure white happiness nothing could touch her.  "Do realize kind week I've had?" said Harry Potter. "Any lesser would hard-pressed read eight Dr. Seuss books!"  "You set time limit."  Harry's Look Flaming Fire grew even hotter. "I logical way knowing I'd save entire school Professor Snape, get beaten Defense class, I told I lost time 5pm dinner Thursday would think I insane -"  "Awww, sounds like someone fell prey planning fallacy."  Raw shock showed Harry Potter's face.  "Oh reminds me, I finished reading first batch books lent me," Hermione said best innocent look. A couple hard books, too. She wondered long taken finish reading them.  "Someday," said Boy-Who-Lived, "when distant descendants Homo sapiens looking back history galaxy wondering went wrong, conclude original mistake someone taught Hermione Granger read."  "But still lose," said Hermione. She held hand chin looked contemplative. "Now exactly lose, I wonder?"  "What?"  "You lost bet," Hermione explained, "so pay forfeit."  "I remember agreeing this!"  "Really?" said Hermione Granger. She put thoughtful look face. Then, idea occurred her, "We'll take vote, then. Everyone Ravenclaw thinks Harry Potter pay up, raise hand!"  "What?" shrieked Harry Potter again.  He spun around saw surrounded sea raised hands.  And Harry Potter looked carefully, would noticed awful lot onlookers seemed girls practically every female room hand raised.  "Stop!" wailed Harry Potter. "You know going ask! Don't realize doing? She's getting make advance commitment now, pressure consistency make agree whatever says afterward!"  "Don't worry," said prefect Penelope Clearwater. "If asks something unreasonable, change minds. Right, everyone?"  And eager nods girls Penelope Clearwater told Hermione's plan.   A silent figure quietly slipped chilled halls Hogwarts dungeons. He present certain room 6:00pm meet certain someone, possible best early, show respect.  But hand turned doorknob opened door dark, silent, unused classroom, silhouette already standing amid rows dusty old desks. A silhouette held small green glowing rod, casting pale light hardly illuminated even held it, let alone surrounding room.  The light hallway died door closed shut behind him, Draco's eyes began process adjusting dim glow.  The silhouette slowly turned behold him, revealing shadowed face partially lit eerie green light.  Draco liked meeting already. Keep chill green light, make taller, give hoods masks, move classroom graveyard, would like start half stories father's friends told Death Eaters.  "I want know, Draco Malfoy," said silhouette tones deadly calm, "that I blame recent defeat."  Draco opened mouth unthinking protest, possible reason blamed -  "It due, anything else, stupidity," continued shadowy figure. "There many things I could done, step along way. You ask exactly I did. You asked help. I one unwisely chose particular method. But fact remains I lost contest half book. The actions pet idiot, favor asked for, and, yes, foolishness going it, caused lose time. More time know. Time which, end, proved critical. The fact remains, Draco Malfoy, asked favor, I would won. And not... instead... lost."  Draco already heard Harry's loss, forfeit Granger claimed him. The news spread faster owls could carried it.  "I understand," Draco said. "I'm sorry." There nothing else could say wanted Harry Potter friends him.  "I asking understanding sorrow," said dark silhouette, still deadly calm. "But I spent two full hours presence Hermione Granger, dressed clothing provided me, visiting fascinating places Hogwarts tiny burbling waterfall looked like snot, accompanied number girls insisted helpful activities strewing path Transfigured rose petals. I date, scion Malfoy. My first date. And I call favor due, pay it."  Draco nodded solemnly. Before arriving taken wise precaution learning every available detail Harry's date, could get hysterical laughing done appointed meeting time, would commit faux pas giggling continuously lost consciousness.  "Do think," Draco said, "that something sad ought happen Granger girl -"  "Spread word Slytherin Granger girl mine anyone meddles affairs remains scattered area wide enough include twelve different spoken languages. And since I Gryffindor I use cunning rather immediate frontal attacks, panic I seen smiling her."  "Or seen second date?" Draco said, allowing tiny note skepticism voice.  "There second date," said green-lit silhouette voice fearsome sounded, like Death Eater, like Amycus Carrow one time Father told stop it, Dark Lord.  Of course still young boy's high unbroken voice combined actual words, well, work. If Harry Potter become next Dark Lord someday, Draco would use Pensieve store copy memory somewhere safe, Harry Potter would never dare betray him.  "But let us talk happier matters," said green-shadowed figure. "Let us talk knowledge power. Draco Malfoy, let us talk Science."  "Yes," said Draco. "Let us speak."  Draco wondered much face could seen, much shadow, eerie green light.  And though Draco kept face serious, smile heart.  He finally real grownup conversation.  "I offer power," said shadowy figure, "and I tell power price. The power comes knowing shape reality gaining control it. What understand, command, power enough walk upon Moon. The price power must learn ask questions Nature, far difficult, accept Nature's answers. You experiments, perform tests see happens. And must accept meaning results tell mistaken. You learn lose, me, Nature. When find arguing reality, let reality win. You find painful, Draco Malfoy, I know strong way. Knowing price, still wish learn human power?"  Draco took deep breath. He'd thought this. And hard see could answer way. He'd instructed take every avenue friendship Harry Potter. It learning, promising anything. He could always stop lessons time...  There certainly number things situation made look like trap, honesty, Draco see could go wrong.  Plus Draco kind want rule world.  "Yes," said Draco.  "Excellent," said shadowy figure. "I something crowded week, take time plan curriculum -"  "I've got lot things I need to consolidate power Slytherin," said Draco, "not mention homework. Maybe start October?"  "Sounds sensible," said shadowy figure, "but I meant say plan curriculum, I need know I teaching you. Three thoughts come me. The first I teach human mind brain. The second option I teach physical universe, arts lie pathway visiting Moon. This involves great deal numbers, certain kind mind numbers beautiful anything else Science teach. Do like numbers, Draco?"  Draco shook head.  "Then much that. You learn mathematics eventually, right away, I think. The third option I teach genetics evolution inheritance, would call blood -"  "That one," said Draco.  The figure nodded. "I thought might say much. But I think painful path you, Draco. What family friends, blood purists, say one thing, find experimental test says another?"  "Then I'll figure make experimental test say right answer!"  There pause, shadowy figure stood mouth open short while.  "Um," said shadowy figure. "It really work like that. That's I trying warn here, Draco. You can't make answer come anything like."  "You always make answer come way," said Draco. That practically first thing tutors taught him. "It's matter finding right arguments."  "No," said shadowy figure, voice rising frustration, "no, no, no! Then get wrong answer can't go Moon way! Nature person, can't trick believing something else, try tell Moon made cheese argue days change Moon! What talking rationalization, like starting sheet paper, moving straight bottom line, using ink write 'and therefore, Moon made cheese', moving back write sorts clever arguments above. But either Moon made cheese isn't. The moment wrote bottom line, already true already false. Whether whole sheet paper ends right conclusion wrong conclusion fixed instant write bottom line. If trying pick two expensive trunks, like shiny one, matter clever arguments come buying it, real rule used choose trunk argue 'pick shiny one', however effective rule picking good trunks, that's kind trunk get. Rationality can't used argue fixed side, possible use deciding side argue. Science convincing anyone blood purists right. That's politics! The power science comes finding way Nature really can't changed arguing! What science tell us blood really works, wizards really inherit powers parents, whether Muggleborns really weaker stronger -"  "Stronger!" said Draco. He trying follow this, puzzled frown face, could see sort made sense certainly like anything he'd ever heard before. And Harry Potter said something Draco possibly let pass. "You think mudbloods stronger?"  "I think nothing," said shadowy figure. "I know nothing. I believe nothing. My bottom line yet written. I figure test magical strength Muggleborns, magical strength purebloods. If tests tell Muggleborns weaker, I believe weaker. If tests tell Muggleborns stronger, I believe stronger. Knowing truths, I gain measure power -"  "And expect believe whatever say?" Draco demanded hotly.  "I expect perform tests personally," said shadowy figure quietly. "Are afraid find?"  Draco stared shadowy figure while, eyes narrowed. "Nice trap, Harry," said. "I'll remember one, new."  The shadowy figure shook head. "It's trap, Draco. Remember - I know we'll find. But understand universe arguing telling come back different answer next time. When put robes scientist must forget politics arguments factions sides, silence desperate clingings mind, wish hear answer Nature." The shadowy figure paused. "Most people can't it. That's difficult. Are sure rather learn brain?"  "And I tell I'd rather learn brain," Draco said, voice hard, "you'll go around telling people I afraid I'd find."  "No," said shadowy figure. "I thing."  "But might sort tests yourself, got wrong answer, I say anything showed someone else." Draco's voice still hard.  "I would still ask first, Draco," shadowy figure said quietly.  Draco paused. He expecting that, he'd thought saw trap but... "You would?"  "Of course. How would I know blackmail could ask them? Draco, I say trap I set you. At least personally. If politics different, I would saying, test shows purebloods stronger."  "Really."  "Yes! That's price anyone pay become scientist!"  Draco held hand. He think.  The shadowy, green-lit figure waited.  It take long think about, though. If discarded confusing parts... Harry Potter planning mess around something could cause gigantic political explosion, would insane walk away let own. "We'll study blood," said Draco.  "Excellent," said figure, smiled. "Congratulations willing ask question."  "Thanks," Draco said, quite managing keep irony voice.  "Hey, think going Moon easy? Be glad involves changing mind sometimes, human sacrifice!"  "Human sacrifice would way easier!"  There slight pause, figure nodded. "Fair point."  "Look, Harry," said Draco without much hope, "I thought idea take things Muggles know, combine things wizards know, become masters worlds. Wouldn't lot easier study things Muggles already found out, like Moon stuff, use power -"  "No," said figure sharp shake head, sending green shadows moving around nose eyes. His voice turned grim. "If cannot learn scientist's art accepting reality, I must tell acceptance discovered. It would like powerful wizard telling gates must opened, seals must broken, proven intelligence discipline surviving lesser perils."  A chill went Draco's spine shuddered involuntarily. He knew visible even dim light. "All right," said Draco. "I understand." Father told many times. When powerful wizard told ready know, pry wanted live.  The figure inclined head. "Indeed. But something else understand. The first scientists, Muggles, lacked traditions. In beginning simply comprehend notion dangerous knowledge, thought things known spoken freely. When searches turned dangerous, told politicians things stayed secret - look like that, Draco, simple stupidity. They smart enough uncover secret first place. But Muggles, first time they'd found anything really dangerous, start tradition secrecy. There war going on, scientists one side worried talk, scientists enemy country would tell politicians first..." The voice trailed significantly. "They destroy world. But close. And going repeat mistake."  "Right," Draco said, voice firm. "We won't. We're wizards, studying science make us Muggles."  "As say," said green-lit silhouette. "We establish Science, magical Science, Science smarter traditions start." The voice grew hard. "The knowledge I share taught alongside disciplines accepting truth, level knowledge keyed progress disciplines, share knowledge one else learned disciplines. Do accept this?"  "Yes," said Draco. What supposed do, say no?  "Good. And discover yourself, keep unless think scientists ready know it. What share among ourselves, tell world unless agree safe world know. And whatever politics allegiances, punish number reveal dangerous magics give away dangerous weapons, matter sort war going on. From day onward, tradition law science among wizards. Are agreed that?"  "Yes," said Draco. Actually starting sound pretty attractive. The Death Eaters tried take power scarier everyone else, actually yet. Maybe time try ruling using secrets instead. "And group stays hidden long possible, everyone agree rules."  "Of course. Definitely."  There short pause.  "We're going need better robes," said shadowy figure, "with hoods -"  "I thinking that," said Draco. "We need whole new robes, though, cowled cloaks put on. I friend Slytherin, she'll take measurements -"  "Don't tell for, though -"  "I'm stupid!"  "And masks now, -" said shadowy figure.  "Right! But later sort special mark servants have, Mark Science, like snake eating Moon right arms -"  "It's called PhD make easy identify people?"  "Huh?"  "I mean, someone like 'okay, everyone pull robes right arms' guy like 'whoops, sorry, looks like I'm spy' -"  "Forget I said anything," said Draco, sweat suddenly springing body. He needed distraction, fast - "And call ourselves? The Science Eaters?"  "No," said shadowy figure slowly. "That sound right..."  Draco wiped robed arm across forehead, wiping away beads moisture. What Dark Lord thinking? Father said Dark Lord smart!  "I've got it!" said shadowy figure suddenly. "You understand yet, trust me, fits."  Right Draco would accepted 'Malfoy Munchers' long changed subject. "What it?"  And standing amid dusty desks unused classroom dungeons Hogwarts, green-lit silhouette Harry Potter spread arms dramatically said, "This day shall mark dawn of... Bayesian Conspiracy."   A silent figure trudged wearily halls Hogwarts direction Ravenclaw.  Harry gone straight meeting Draco dinner, stayed dinner barely long enough choke fast gulps food going bed.  It even 7pm yet, well past bedtime Harry. He'd realized last night able use Time-Turner Saturday book-reading contest already over. But could still use Time-Turner Friday night, gain time way. So Harry pushed stay awake 9pm Friday, protective shell opened, used four hours remaining Time-Turner spin back 5pm collapse sleep. He'd woken around 2am Saturday morning, planned, read next twelve hours straight... still enough. And Harry would going sleep rather early next days, sleep cycle caught again.  The portrait door asked Harry dumb riddle meant eleven-year-olds answered without words even passing conscious mind, Harry staggered stairs dorm room, changed pajamas collapsed bed.  And found pillow seemed rather lumpy.  Harry groaned. He sat reluctantly, twisted bed, lifted pillow.  This revealed note, two golden Galleons, book titled Occlumency: The Hidden Arte.  Harry picked note read:  My, get trouble quickly. Your father match you.  You made powerful enemy. Snape commands loyalty, admiration, fear House Slytherin. You cannot trust House now, whether come friendly guise fearsome.  From must meet Snape's eyes. He Legilimens read mind do. I enclosed book may help learn protect yourself, though far get without tutor. Still may hope least detect intrusion.  So may find extra time study Occlumency, I enclosed 2 Galleons, price answer sheets homework first-year History Magic class (Professor Binns given tests assignments every year since died). Your newfound friends Weasley twins able sell copy. It goes without saying must get caught possession.  Of Professor Quirrell I know little. He Slytherin Defense Professor, two marks him. Consider carefully advice gives you, tell nothing wish known.  Dumbledore pretends insane. He extremely intelligent, continue step closets vanish, certainly deduce possession invisibility cloak done already. Avoid whenever possible, hide Cloak Invisibility somewhere safe (NOT pouch) time cannot avoid him, step great care presence.  Please careful future, Harry Potter.  - Santa Claus  Harry stared note.  It seem pretty good advice. Of course Harry going cheat History class even gave dead monkey professor. But Severus's Legilimency... whoever'd sent note knew lot important, secret things willing tell Harry them. The note still warning Dumbledore stealing Cloak point Harry honestly clue bad sign, could understandable mistake.  There seemed sort intrigue going inside Hogwarts. Maybe Harry compared stories Dumbledore note-sender, could work combined picture would accurate? Like agreed something, then...  ...whatever...  Harry stuffed everything pouch turned Quieter pulled cover head died.   It Sunday morning Harry eating pancakes Great Hall, sharp quick bites, glancing nervously watch every seconds.  It 8:02am, precisely two hours one minute, would exactly one week since he'd seen Weasleys crossed onto Platform Nine Three-Quarters.  And thought occurred him... Harry know valid way think universe, know anything more, seemed possible...  That...  Not enough interesting things happened last week.  When done eating breakfast, Harry planned go straight room hide bottom level trunk talk anyone 10:03am.  And Harry saw Weasley twins walking toward him. One carrying something concealed behind back.  He scream run away.  He scream run away.  Whatever was... could well be...  ...the grand finale...  He really scream run away.  With resigned feeling universe would come get anyway, Harry continued slicing pancake fork knife. He muster energy. That sad truth. Harry knew people felt tired running, tired trying escape fate, fell ground let horrifically befanged tentacled demons darkest abyss drag unspeakable destiny.  The Weasley twins drew closer.  And yet closer.  Harry ate another bite pancake.  The Weasley twins arrived, grinning brightly.  "Hello, Fred," Harry said dully. One twins nodded. "Hello, George." The twin nodded.  "You sound tired," said George.  "You cheer up," said Fred.  "Look got you!"  And George took, behind Fred's back -  A cake twelve flaming candles.  There pause, Ravenclaw table stared them.  "That's right," said someone. "Harry Potter born thirty-first Jul-"  "HE IS COMING," said huge hollow voice cut conversation like sword ice. "THE ONE WHO WILL TEAR APART THE VERY -"  Dumbledore leapt throne run straight Head Table seized hold woman speaking awful words, Fawkes appeared flash, three vanished crack fire.  There shocked pause...  ...followed heads turning direction Harry Potter.  "I it," Harry said tired voice.  "That prophecy!" someone table hissed. "And I bet you!"  Harry sighed.  He stood seat, raised voice, said loudly conversations starting up, "It's me! Obviously! I'm coming here, I'm already here!"  Harry sat back again.  The people looking turned away again.  Someone else table said, "Then about?"  And dull, leaden sensation, Harry realized already Hogwarts.  Call wild guess, Harry feeling undead Dark Lord would showing one days.  The conversation continued around him.  "Not mention, tear apart what?"  "I thought I heard Trelawney start say something 'S' Headmaster grabbed her."  "Like... soul? Sun?"  "If someone's going tear apart Sun we're really trouble!"  That seemed rather unlikely Harry, unless world contained scary things heard David Criswell's ideas star lifting.  "So," Harry said tired tones, "this happens every Sunday breakfast, it?"  "No," said student might seventh year, frowning grimly. "It doesn't."  Harry shrugged. "Whatever. Anyone want birthday cake?"  "But birthday!" said student who'd objected last time.  That cue Fred George start laughing, course.  Even Harry managed weary smile.  As first slice served him, Harry said, "I've really long week."   And Harry sitting cavern level trunk, slid shut locked one could get in, blanket pulled head, waiting week over.  10:01.  10:02.  10:03, sure...  10:04 first week done.  Harry breathed sigh relief, gingerly pulled blanket head.  A moments later, emerged bright sunlit air dorm.  Shortly after, Ravenclaw common room. A people looked him, one said anything tried talk him.  Harry found nice wide writing desk, pulled back comfortable chair, sat down. From pouch drew sheet paper pencil.  Mum Dad told Harry uncertain terms understood enthusiasm leaving home getting away parents, write every week without fail, knew alive, unharmed, prison.  Harry stared blank sheet paper. Let's see...  After leaving parents train station, he'd...  ...gotten acquainted boy raised Darth Vader, become friends three infamous pranksters Hogwarts, met Hermione, there'd Incident Sorting Hat... Monday he'd given time machine treat sleep disorder, gotten legendary invisibility cloak unknown benefactor, rescued seven Hufflepuffs staring five scary older boys one threatened break finger, realized possessed mysterious dark side, learned cast Frigideiro Charms class, gotten started rivalry Hermione... Tuesday introduced Astronomy taught Professor Aurora Sinistra nice, History Magic taught ghost ought exorcised replaced tape recorder... Wednesday, he'd pronounced Most Dangerous Student Classroom... Thursday, let's even think Thursday... Friday, Incident Potions Class, followed blackmailing Headmaster, followed Defense Professor beaten class, followed Defense Professor turning awesome human still walked face Earth... Saturday he'd lost bet gone first date started redeeming Draco... morning Professor Trelawney's unheard prophecy might might indicate immortal Dark Lord attack Hogwarts.  Harry mentally organized material, started writing.  Dear Mum Dad:  Hogwarts lots fun. I learned violate Second Law Thermodynamics Charms class, I met girl named Hermione Granger reads faster I do.  I'd better leave that.  Your loving son,   Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres.   Chapter 22: The Scientific Method  Something, somewhere, somewhen, must happened differently...

A work like much good people read it.  And now, back regularly scheduled fic...   The key strategy choose path J. K. Rowling, choose paths lead J. K. Rowling.   A small study room, near Ravenclaw dorm, one many many unused rooms Hogwarts. Gray stone floors, red brick walls, dark stained wood ceiling, four glowing glass globes set four walls room. A circular table looked like wide slab black marble set thick black marble legs columns, proved light (weight mass both) difficult pick move around necessary. Two comfortably cushioned chairs seemed first locked floor inconvenient places, would, two finally discovered, scoot around stood soon leaned posture looked like sit down.  There also seemed number bats flying around room.  That where, future historians would one day record - whole project ever actually amounted anything - scientific study magic begun, two young first-year Hogwarts students.  Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, theorist.  And Hermione Jean Granger, experimenter test subject.  Harry better classes now, least classes considered interesting. He'd read books, books eleven-year-olds either. He'd practiced Transfiguration over one extra hours every day, taking hour beginning Occlumency. He taking worthwhile classes seriously, turning homework every day, using free time learn required, read books beyond given textbooks, looking master subject memorize test answers, excel. You see much outside Ravenclaw. And even within Ravenclaw, remaining competitors Padma Patil (whose parents came non-English-speaking culture thus raised actual work ethic), Anthony Goldstein (out certain tiny ethnic group 25% Nobel Prizes), course, striding far everyone like Titan strolling pack puppies, Hermione Granger.  To run particular experiment needed test subject learn sixteen new spells, own, without help correction. That meant test subject Hermione. Period.  It mentioned point bats flying around room glowing.  Harry trouble accepting implications this.  "Oogely boogely!" Hermione said again.  Again, tip Hermione's wand, abrupt, transitionless appearance bat. One moment, empty air. The next moment, bat. Its wings seemed already moving instant appeared.  And still glowing.  "Can I stop now?" said Hermione.  "Are sure," Harry said seemed block throat, "that maybe bit practice get glow?" He violating experimental procedure he'd written beforehand, sin, violating like results getting, mortal sin, could go Science Hell that, seem mattering anyway.  "What change time?" Hermione said, sounding little weary.  "The durations oo,eh, ee sounds. It's supposed 3 2 2, 3 1 1."  "Oogely boogely!" said Hermione.  The bat materialized one wing spun pathetically floor, flopping around circle gray stone.  "Now really?" said Hermione.  "3 2 1."  "Oogely boogely!"  This time bat wings fell plop like dead mouse.  "3 1 2."  And lo bat materialize fly toward ceiling, healthy glowing bright green.  Hermione nodded satisfaction. "Okay, next?"  There long pause.  "Seriously? You seriously say Oogely boogely duration oo,eh, ee sounds ratio 3 1 2, bat glow? Why? Why? For love sacred, why?"  "Why not?"  "AAAAAAAAARRRRRRGHHHH!"  Thud. Thud. Thud.  Harry thought nature magic while, designed series experiments based premise virtually everything wizards believed magic wrong.  You really need say 'Wingardium Leviosa' exactly right way order levitate something, because, come on, 'Wingardium Leviosa'? The universe going check said 'Wingardium Leviosa' exactly right way otherwise make quill float?  No. Obviously no, thought seriously. Someone, quite possibly actual preschool child, rate English-speaking magic user, thought 'Wingardium Leviosa' sounded flyish floaty, originally spoken words casting spell first time. And told everyone else necessary.  But (Harry reasoned) way, built universe, built you.  There old story passed among scientists, cautionary tale, story Blondlot N-Rays.  Shortly discovery X-Rays, eminent French physicist named Prosper-Rene Blondlot - first measure speed radio waves show propagated speed light - announced discovery amazing new phenomenon, N-Rays, would induce faint brightening screen. You look hard see it, there. N-Rays sorts interesting properties. They bent aluminium could focused aluminium prism striking treated thread cadmium sulfide, would glow faintly dark...  Soon dozens scientists confirmed Blondlot's results, especially France.  But still scientists, England Germany, said quite sure could see faint glow.  Blondlot said probably setting machinery wrong.  One day Blondlot given demonstration N-Rays. The lights turned out, assistant called brightening darkening Blondlot performed manipulations.  It normal demonstration, results going expected.  Even though American scientist named Robert Wood quietly stolen aluminium prism center Blondlot's mechanism.  And end N-Rays.  Reality, Philip K. Dick said, which, stop believing it, go away.  Blondlot's sin obvious retrospect. He told assistant doing. Blondlot made sure assistant know tried tried, asking describe screen's brightness. It could simple.  Nowadays called "blinding" one things modern scientists took granted. If psychology experiment see whether people got angrier hit head red truncheons green truncheons, get look subjects decide "angry" were. You would snap photos they'd hit truncheon, send photos panel raters, would rate scale 1 10 angry person looked, obviously without knowing color truncheon they'd hit with. Indeed good reason tell raters experiment about, all. You certainly tell experimental subjects thought ought angrier hit red truncheons. You'd offer 20 pounds, lure test room, hit truncheon, color randomly assigned course, snap photo. In fact truncheon-hitting photo-snapping would done assistant told hypothesis, look expectant, hit harder, snap photo right time.  Blondlot destroyed reputation sort mistake would get failing grade probably derisive laughter T.A. first-year undergraduate course experimental design... 1991.  But bit longer ago, 1904, taken months Robert Wood formulated obvious alternative hypothesis figured test it, dozens scientists sucked in.  More two centuries science gotten started. That late scientific history, still obvious.  Which made entirely plausible tiny wizarding world, science seem much known all, one ever tried first, simplest, obvious thing modern scientist would think check.  The books full complicated instructions things exactly right order cast spell. And, Harry hypothesized, process obeying instructions, checking following correctly, probably something. It forced concentrate spell. Being told wave wand wish probably work well. And believed spell supposed work certain way, practiced way, might able convince could work way...  ...if simple wrong thing, tried test alternative forms yourself.  But know original spell like?  What gave Hermione list spells studied yet, taken book silly prank spells Hogwarts library, spells correct original instructions, others one changed gesture, one changed word? What kept instructions constant, told spell supposed create red worm supposed create blue worm instead?  Well, case, turned out...  ...Harry trouble believing results here...  ...if told Hermione say "Oogely boogely" vowel durations ratio 3 1 1, instead correct ratio 3 1 2, still got bat glow more.  Not belief irrelevant here. Not words wand movements mattered.  If gave Hermione completely incorrect information spell supposed do, would stop working.  If tell spell supposed do, would stop working.  If knew vague terms spell supposed do, partially wrong, spell would work originally described book, way she'd told should.  Harry was, moment, literally banging head brick wall. Not hard. He want damage precious brains. But outlet frustration, would spontaneously catch fire.  Thud. Thud. Thud.  It seemed universe actually want say 'Wingardium Leviosa' wanted say certain exact way care thought pronunciation cared felt gravity.  WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY?  The worst part smug, amused look Hermione's face.  Hermione okay sitting around obediently following Harry's instructions without told why.  So Harry explained testing.  Harry explained testing it.  Harry explained probably wizard tried them.  Harry explained actually fairly confident prediction.  Because, Harry said, way universe actually wanted say 'Wingardium Leviosa'.  Hermione pointed books said. Hermione asked Harry really thought smarter, eleven years old month Hogwarts education, wizards world disagreed him.  Harry said following exact words:  "Of course."  Now Harry staring red brick directly front contemplating hard would hit head order give concussion would interfere long-term memory formation prevent remembering later. Hermione laughing, could feel intent laugh radiating behind like dreadful pressure skin, sort like knowing stalked serial killer worse.  "Say it," Harry said.  "I going to," said kindly voice Hermione Granger. "It seem nice."  "Just get with," said Harry.  "Okay! So gave whole long lecture hard basic science might need stay problem thirty-five years, went expected us make greatest discovery history magic first hour working together. You hope, really expected it. You're silly."  "Thank you. Now -"  "I've read books gave I still know call that. Overconfidence? Planning fallacy? Super duper Lake Wobegon effect? They'll name you. Harry Bias."  "All right!"  "But cute. It's boy thing do."  "Drop dead."  "Aw, say romantic things."  Thud. Thud. Thud.  "So what's next?" said Hermione.  Harry rested head bricks. His forehead starting hurt he'd banging it. "Nothing. I go back design different experiments."  Over last month, Harry carefully worked out, advance, course experimentation would lasted December.  It would great set experiments first test falsified basic premise.  Harry could believe dumb.  "Let correct myself," said Harry. "I need design one new experiment. I'll let know we've got it, we'll it, I'll design next one. How sound?"  "It sounds like someone wasted whole lot effort."  Thud. Ow. He'd done bit harder he'd planned.  "So," said Hermione. She leaning back chair smug look back face. "What discover today?"  "I discovered," said Harry gritted teeth, "that comes truly basic research genuinely confusing problem clue what's going on, books scientific methodology worth crap -"  "Language, Mr. Potter! Some us innocent young girls!"  "Fine. But books worth carp, that's kind fish anything bad, would given following important piece advice: When there's confusing problem starting falsifiable hypothesis, go test it. Find simple, easy way basic check right away. Don't worry designing elaborate course experiments would make grant proposal look impressive funding agency. Just check fast possible whether ideas false start investing huge amounts effort them. How sound moral?"  "Mmm... okay," said Hermione. "But I also hoping something like 'Hermione's books worthless. They're written wise old wizards know way magic I do. I pay attention Hermione's books say.' Can moral too?"  Harry's jaw seemed clenched tightly let words out, nodded.  "Great!" Hermione said. "I liked experiment. We learned lot took hour so."  "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!"   In dungeons Slytherin.  An unused classroom lit eerie green light, much brighter time coming small crystal globe temporary enchantment, eerie green light nonetheless, casting strange shadows dusty desks.  Two boy-sized figures cowled grey cloaks (no masks) entered silence, sat two chairs opposite desk.  It second meeting Bayesian Conspiracy.  Draco Malfoy sure look forward not.  Harry Potter, judging expression face, seem doubts appropriate mood.  Harry Potter looked like ready kill someone.  "Hermione Granger," said Harry Potter, Draco opening mouth. "Don't ask."  He gone another date, could he? thought Draco, make sense.  "Harry," said Draco, "I'm sorry I ask anyway, really order mudblood girl expensive mokeskin pouch birthday?"  "Yes, I did. You've already worked why, course."  Draco reached raked fingers hair frustration, cowl brushing back hand. He quite sure why, say so. And Slytherin knew courting Harry Potter, he'd made obvious enough Defense class. "Harry," said Draco, "people know I'm friends you, know Conspiracy course, know we're friends, makes look bad sort thing."  Harry Potter's face tightened. "Anyone Slytherin can't understand concept acting nice toward people actually like ground fed pet snakes."  "There lot people Slytherin don't," Draco said, voice serious. "Most people stupid, look good front anyway." Harry Potter understand ever wanted get anywhere life.  "What care people think? Are really going live life needing explain everything dumbest idiots Slytherin, letting judge you? I'm sorry, Draco, I'm lowering cunning plots level dumbest Slytherins understand, might make look bad otherwise. Not even friendship worth that. It would take fun life. Tell ever thought thing someone Slytherin stupid breathe, beneath dignity Malfoy to pander them."  Draco genuinely hadn't. Ever. Pandering idiots like breathing, without thinking it.  "Harry," Draco said last. "Just whatever want, without worrying looks, smart. The Dark Lord worried looked! He feared hated, knew exactly sort fear hate wanted create. Everyone worry people think."  The cowled figure shrugged. "Perhaps. Remind sometime tell something called Asch's Conformity Experiment, might find quite amusing. For I'll note dangerous worry people think instinct, actually care, matter cold-blooded calculation. Remember, I beaten bullied older Slytherins fifteen minutes, afterward I stood graciously forgave them. Just like good virtuous Boy-Who-Lived ought do. But cold-blooded calculations, Draco, tell I use dumbest idiots Slytherin, since I pet snake. So I reason care think I conduct duel Hermione Granger."  Draco clench fists frustration. "She's mudblood," Draco said, keeping voice calm, rather shouting. "If like her, push stairs."  "Ravenclaw would know -"  "Have Pansy Parkinson push stairs! You even manipulate her, offer Sickle she'd it!"  "I would know! Hermione beat book-reading contest, getting better grades me, I defeat brain count!"  "She's mudblood! Why respect much?"  "She's power among Ravenclaws! Why care powerless idiot Slytherin thinks?"  "It's called politics! And can't play can't power!"  "Walking moon power! Being great wizard power! There kinds power require spend rest life pandering morons!"  Both stopped, and, almost perfect unison, began taking deep breaths calm themselves.  "Sorry," Harry Potter said moments, wiping sweat forehead. "Sorry, Draco. You've got lot political power makes sense keep it. You calculating Slytherin thinks. It's important game I insulted it. But can't ask lower level game Ravenclaw, look bad associating me. Tell Slytherin gritting teeth pretend friend."  That exactly Draco told Slytherin, still sure whether true.  "Anyway," Draco said. "Speaking image. I'm afraid I've got bad news. Rita Skeeter heard stories asking questions."  Harry Potter raised eyebrows. "Who?"  "She writes Daily Prophet," Draco said. He tried keep worry voice. The Daily Prophet one Father's primary tools, used like wizard's wand. "That's newspaper people actually pay attention to. Rita Skeeter writes celebrities, puts it, uses quill puncture over-inflated reputations. If can't find rumors you, she'll make own."  "I see," said Harry Potter. His green-lit face looked thoughtful beneath cowl.  Draco hesitated saying say next. By someone certainly reported Father courting Harry Potter, Father would also know Draco written home it, Father would understand Draco think could actually keep secret, sent clear message Draco practicing game still Father's side, since Draco tempted away, would sending false reports.  It followed Father probably anticipated Draco say next.  Playing game Father real rather unnerving sensation. Even side. It was, one hand, exhiliarating, Draco also knew end would turn Father played game better. There way could possibly go.  "Harry," Draco finally said. "This suggestion. This advice. Just way is. My father could almost certainly quash article. But would cost you."  That Father expecting Draco tell Harry Potter exactly something Draco said loud. Harry Potter would work own, not.  But instead Harry Potter shook head, smiling beneath cowl. "I intention trying quash Rita Skeeter."  Draco even try keep incredulity voice. "You can't tell care newspaper says you!"  "I care less might think," said Harry Potter. "But I ways dealing likes Skeeter. I need Lucius's help."  A worried look came Draco's face could stop it. Whatever Harry Potter next, would something Father expecting, Draco feeling nervous might lead.  Draco also realized hair getting sweaty underneath cowl. He'd never actually worn one before, realized Death Eaters' cloaks probably things like Cooling Charms.  Harry Potter wiped sweat forehead again, grimaced, took wand, pointed upward, took deep breath, said "Frigideiro!"  Moments later Draco felt cold draft.  "Frigideiro! Frigideiro! Frigideiro! Frigideiro! Frigideiro!"  Then Harry Potter lowered wand, though hand seemed bit shaky, put back robes.  The whole room seemed perceptibly cooler. Draco could done too, still, bad.  "So," Draco said. "Science. You're going tell blood."  "We're going find blood," Harry Potter said. "By experiments."  "All right," Draco said. "What sort experiments?"  Harry Potter smiled evilly beneath cowl, said, "You tell me."   Draco heard something called Socratic Method, teaching asking questions (named ancient philosopher smart real Muggle hence disguised pureblood wizard). One tutors used Socratic teaching lot. It annoying effective.  Then Potter Method, insane.  To fair, Draco admit Harry Potter tried Socratic Method first working well.  Harry Potter asked Draco would go disproving blood purist hypothesis wizards neat stuff they'd done eight centuries ago interbred Muggleborns Squibs.  Draco said understand Harry Potter could sit straight face claim trap.  Harry Potter replied, still straight face, trap would pathetically obvious ought ground fed pet snakes, trap, simply rule scientists operated try disprove theories, made honest effort failed, victory.  Draco tried point staggering stupidity suggesting key surviving duel cast Avada Kedavra foot miss.  Harry Potter nodded.  Draco shaken head.  Harry Potter presented idea scientists watched ideas fight see ones won, fight without opponent, Draco needed figure opponents blood purist hypothesis fight blood purism could win, Draco understood little better even though Harry Potter said rather distasteful look. Like, clear blood purism way world really was, sky blue, theory true, sky green; nobody seen sky yet; went outside looked blood purists won; happened six times row, people would start noticing trend.  Harry Potter proceeded claim opponents Draco inventing weak, blood purism get credit defeating battle impressive enough. Draco understood too. Wizards gotten weaker house elves stealing magic sounded impressive either.  (Though Harry Potter said one least testable, could try check house elves gotten stronger time, even draw picture representing increasing strength house elves another picture representing decreasing strength wizards two pictures matched would point house elves, said completely serious tones Draco felt impulse ask Dobby pointed questions Veritaserum snapping it.)  And Harry Potter finally said Draco fix battle, scientists dumb, would obvious fixed battle, real fight, two different theories might really true, test true hypothesis would win, something actually would come different ways depending hypothesis actually correct, would experienced scientists watching make sure exactly happened. Harry Potter claimed wanted know blood really worked need see blood purism really win Draco going fool theories knocked down.  Even seen point, Draco able invent "plausible alternatives", Harry Potter put it, idea wizards getting less powerful mixing blood mud. It obviously true.  It Harry Potter said, rather frustrated, imagine Draco really bad considering different viewpoints, surely there'd Death Eaters who'd posed enemies blood purism come much plausible-sounding arguments side Draco offering. If Draco trying pose member Dumbledore's faction, come house elf hypothesis, fooled anyone second.  Draco forced admit point.  Hence Potter Method.  "Please, Dr. Malfoy," whined Harry Potter, "why accept paper?"  Harry Potter needed repeat phrase "just pretend pretending scientist" three times Draco understood.  In moment Draco realized something deeply wrong Harry Potter's brain, anyone tried Legilimency would probably never come back again.  Harry Potter gone considerable detail: Draco pretend Death Eater posing editor scientific journal, Dr. Malfoy, wanted reject enemy Dr. Potter's paper "On Heritability Magical Ability", Death Eater act like real scientist would, would revealed Death Eater executed, Dr. Malfoy also watched rivals needed appear reject Dr. Potter's paper neutral scientific reasons would lose position journal editor.  It wonder Sorting Hat gibbering madly St. Mungo's.  It also complicated thing anyone ever asked Draco pretend possible way could refused challenge.  Right were, Harry Potter put it, getting mood.  "I'm afraid, Dr. Potter, wrote wrong color ink," Draco said. "Next!"  Dr. Potter's face excellent job crumpling despair, Draco help feel flash Dr. Malfoy's glee, even though Death Eater pretending Dr. Malfoy.  This part fun. He could done day long.  Dr. Potter got chair, slumped dismay, trudged off, turned Harry Potter, gave Draco thumbs-up, turned back Dr. Potter again, approaching eager smile.  Dr. Potter sat presented Dr. Malfoy piece parchment written:  On Heritability Magical Ability  Dr. H. J. Potter-Evans-Verres, Institute Sufficiently Advanced Science  My observation:  Today's wizards can't things impressive   wizards used 800 years ago.  My conclusion:  Wizardkind become weaker mixing   blood Muggleborns Squibs.  "Dr. Malfoy," said Dr. Potter hopeful look, "I wondering Journal Irreproducible Results could consider publication paper entitled 'On Heritability Magical Ability'."  Draco looked parchment, smiling considered possible rejections. If professor, would refused essay short, -  "It's long, Dr. Potter," said Dr. Malfoy.  For moment genuine incredulity Dr. Potter's face.  "Ah..." said Dr. Potter. "How I get rid separate lines observations conclusions, put therefore -"  "Then it'll short. Next!"  Dr. Potter trudged off.  "All right," said Harry Potter, "you're getting good this. Two times practice, third time real, interruptions between, I'll come straight time reject paper based actual content, remember, scientific rivals watching."  Dr. Potter's next paper perfect every way, marvel kind, unfortunately rejected Dr. Malfoy's journal trouble letter E. Dr. Potter offered rewrite without words, Dr. Malfoy explained really vowel problem.  The paper rejected Tuesday.  It was, fact, Saturday.  Dr. Potter tried point told "Next!"  (Draco starting understand Snape used hold Dumbledore get position let awful students.)  And -  Dr. Potter approaching superior smirk face.  "This latest paper, On Heritability Magical Ability," Dr. Potter stated confidently, thrust parchment. "I decided allow journal publish it, prepared perfect accordance guidelines may publish quickly."  The Death Eater decided track kill Dr. Potter mission done. Dr. Malfoy kept polite smile face, since rivals watching, said...  (The pause stretched, Dr. Potter looking impatiently.)  ..."Let look that, please."  Dr. Malfoy took parchment perused carefully.  The Death Eater starting get nervous fact real scientist, Draco trying remember talk like Harry Potter.  "You, ah, need consider possible explanations your, um, observation, besides one -"  "Really?" interrupted Dr. Potter. "Like what, exactly? House elves stealing magic? My data admit one possible conclusion, Dr. Malfoy. There plausible hypotheses."  Draco trying furiously order brain think, would say posing member Dumbledore's faction, claim explanation wizardkind's decline, Draco never bothered actually ask that...  "If can't think way explain data, publish paper, Dr. Malfoy."  It sneer Dr. Potter's face it.  "Oh yeah?" snapped Dr. Malfoy. "How know magic fading away?"  Time stopped.  Draco Harry Potter exchanged looks appalled horror.  Then Harry Potter spat something probably extremely bad word raised Muggles. "I think that!" said Harry Potter. "And I have. The magic goes away. Damn, damn, damn!"  The alarm Harry Potter's voice contagious. Without even thinking it, Draco's hand went robes clutched wand. He'd thought House Malfoy safe, long married families could trace bloodlines back four generations supposed safe, never occurred might nothing anyone could stop end magic. "Harry, do?" Draco's voice rising panic. "What do?"  "Let think!"  After moments, Harry grabbed nearby desk quill roll parchment he'd used write pretend paper, started scribbling something.  "We'll figure out," Harry said, voice tight, "if magic fading world we'll figure fast fading much time left something, we'll figure fading, we'll something it. Draco, wizarding powers declining steady rate, sudden drops?"  "I... I know..."  "You told one matched four founders Hogwarts. So going least eight centuries, then? You can't remember hearing anything problems suddenly appearing five centuries ago anything like that?"  Draco trying frantically think. "I always heard nobody good Merlin nobody good Founders Hogwarts."  "All right," Harry said. He still scribbling. "Because three centuries ago Muggles started believe magic, I thought might something it. And century half ago Muggles began using kind technology stops working around magic I wondering might also go way around."  Draco exploded chair, angry could hardly even speak. "It's Muggles -"  "Damn it!" roared Harry. "Weren't even listening yourself? It's going eight centuries least Muggles anything interesting then! We figure real truth! The Muggles might something go blaming everything stops us figuring what's really going one day going wake morning find wand stick wood!"  Draco's breath stopped throat. His father often said wands break hands speeches Draco never really thought meant, going happen all. And suddenly seemed real. Just stick wood. Draco could imagine would like take wand try cast spell find nothing happening...  That could happen everyone.  There would wizards, magic, ever. Just Muggles legends ancestors able do. Some Muggles would called Malfoy, would left name.  For first time life, Draco realized Death Eaters.  He'd always taken granted becoming Death Eater something grew up. Now Draco understood, knew Father Father's friends sworn give lives prevent nightmare coming pass, things stand watch happen. But going happen anyway, sacrifices, friends they'd lost Dumbledore, family they'd lost, nothing...  "Magic can't fading away," Draco said. His voice breaking. "It fair."  Harry stopped scribbling looked up. His face angry expression. "Your father never told life fair?"  Father said every single time Draco used word. "But, but, awful believe -"  "Draco, let introduce something I call Litany Tarski. It changes every time use it. On occasion runs like so: If magic fading world, I want believe magic fading world. If magic fading world, I want believe magic fading world. Let become attached beliefs I may want. If we're living world magic fading, that's believe, know what's coming, stop it, worst case, prepared time left. Not believing stop happening. So question ask whether magic actually fading, that's world live that's want believe. Litany Gendlin: What's true already so, owning make worse. Got that, Draco? I'm going make memorize later. It's something repeat time start wondering good idea believe something actually true. In fact I want say right now. What's true already so, owning make worse. Say it."  "What's true already so," repeated Draco, voice trembling, "owning make worse."  "If magic fading, I want believe magic fading. If magic fading, I want believe magic fading. Say it."  Draco repeated back words, sickness churning stomach.  "Good," Harry said, "remember, might happening, believe it, either. First want know what's actually going on, world actually live in." Harry turned back work, scribbled more, turned parchment Draco could see it. Draco leaned desk Harry brought green light closer.  Observation:  Wizardry powerful Hogwarts founded.  Hypotheses:  1. Magic fading.   2. Wizards interbreeding Muggles Squibs.   3. Knowledge cast powerful spells lost.   4. Wizards eating wrong foods children, something else besides blood making grow weaker.   5. Muggle technology interfering magic. (Since 800 years ago?)   6. Stronger wizards fewer children. (Draco = child? Check 3 powerful wizards, Quirrell / Dumbledore / Dark Lord, children.)  Tests:  "All right," Harry said. His breathing sounded little calmer. "Now dealing confusing problem idea what's going on, smart thing figure really simple tests, things look right away. We need fast tests distinguish hypotheses. Observations would come different way least one compared ones."  Draco stared list shock. He suddenly realizing knew awful lot purebloods children. Himself, Vincent, Gregory, practically everyone. The two powerful wizards everyone talked Dumbledore Dark Lord neither children like Harry suspected...  "It's going really hard distinguish 2 6," Harry said, "it's blood either way, try track decline wizardry compare many kids different wizards measure abilities Muggleborns compared purebloods..." Harry's fingers tapping nervously desk. "Let's lump 6 2 call blood hypothesis now. 4 unlikely everyone would notice sudden drop wizards switched new foods, hard see would've changed steadily 800 years. 5 unlikely reason, sudden drop, Muggles anything 800 years back. 4 looks like 2 5 looks like 1 anyway. So mainly trying distinguish 1, 2, 3." Harry turned parchment himself, drew ellipse around three numbers, turned back. "Magic fading, blood weakening, knowledge disappearing. What test comes differently depending true? What could see would mean one false?"  "I know!" blurted Draco. "Why asking me? You're scientist!"  "Draco," Harry said, note pleading desperation voice, "I know Muggle scientists know! You grew wizarding world, I didn't! You know magic I know magic I thought whole idea first place, start thinking like scientist solve this!"  Draco swallowed hard stared paper.  Magic fading... wizards interbreeding Muggles... knowledge lost...  "What world look like magic fading?" said Harry Potter. "You know magic, one guessing me! Imagine telling story it, happens story?"  Draco imagined it. "Charms used work stop working." Wizards wake find wands sticks wood...  "What world look like wizarding blood gets weaker?"  "People can't things ancestors could do."  "What world look like knowledge lost?"  "People know cast Charms first place..." said Draco. He stopped, surprised himself. "That's test, it?"  Harry nodded decisively. "That's one." He wrote parchment Tests:  A. Are spells know can't cast (1 2) lost spells longer known (3)?  "So distinguishes 1 2 one hand, 3 hand," said Harry. "Now need way distinguish 1 2. Magic fading, blood weakening, could tell difference?"  "What kind Charms students used cast first year Hogwarts?" said Draco. "If used able cast much powerful Charms, blood stronger -"  Harry Potter shook head. "Or magic stronger. We figure way telling difference." Harry stood chair, began pacing nervously classroom. "No, wait, might still work. Suppose different spells use different amounts magical energy. Then ambient magic weakened, powerful spells would die first, spells everyone learns first year would stay same..." Harry's nervous pacing sped up. "It's good test, powerful wizardry lost versus wizardry lost, someone's blood could weak powerful wizardry strong enough easy spells... Draco, know powerful wizards within single era, like powerful wizards century, powerful children? If Dark Lord cast Cooling Charm eleven, could frozen whole room?"  Draco's face screwed tried recollect. "I can't remember hearing anything Dark Lord I think Dumbledore's supposed done something amazing Transfiguration O.W.L.s fifth year... I think powerful wizards good Hogwarts too..."  Harry scowled, still pacing. "They could studying hard. Still, first-year students learned spells seemed powerful now, could call weak evidence favoring 1 2... wait, hold on." Harry stopped stood. "I another test might distinguish 1 2. It would take explain, uses things scientists know blood inheritance, easy question ask. And combine test test come way, that's strong hint answer." Harry almost ran back desk, took parchment wrote:  B. Did ancient first-year students cast sort spells, power, now? (Weak evidence 1 2, blood could also losing powerful wizardry only.)  C. Additional test distinguishes 1 2 using scientific knowledge blood, explain later.  "Okay," said Harry, "we least try tell difference 1 2 3, let's go right away, figure tests ones already have. Now going look little odd Draco Malfoy Harry Potter go around asking questions together, here's idea. You'll go Hogwarts find old portraits ask spells learned cast first years. They're portraits know there's anything odd Draco Malfoy that. I'll ask recent portraits living people spells know can't cast, one notice anything unusual Harry Potter asks weird questions. And I'll complicated research forgotten spells, I want one gather data I need scientific question. It's simple question able find answer asking portraits. You might want write down, ready?"  Draco sat scrabbled bookbag parchment quill. When laid desk, Draco looked up, face determined. "Go ahead."  "Find portraits knew married Squib couple - make face, Draco, important information. Just ask recent portraits Gryffindors something. Find portraits knew married Squib couple well enough know names children. Write name child whether child wizard, Squib, Muggle. If know whether child Squib Muggle, write 'non-wizard'. Write every child couple had, leave out. If portrait knows name wizarding children, names children, write data couple. It's important bring data someone knows children Squib couple had, well enough know name. Try get least forty names total, can, time more, even better. Have got that?"  "Repeat it," Draco said, done writing, Harry repeated it.  "I've got it," Draco said, "but -"  "It one secrets blood scientists already discovered. I'll explain get back. Let's split meet back hour, 6:22pm be. Are ready go?"  Draco nodded decisively. It rushed, he'd long since taught rush.  "Then go!" said Harry Potter yanked cowled cloak shoved pouch, began eating it, and, without even waiting pouch finish, spun around began striding rapidly toward classroom door, bumping desk almost falling haste.  By time Draco managed get cloak stow bookbag, Harry Potter gone.  Draco almost ran door.   Chapter 23: Belief Belief  Everybody wants rock wind piece string around J. K. Rowling.   "And Janet Squib," said portrait short young woman gold-trimmed hat.  Draco wrote down. That twenty-eight time go back meet Harry.  He'd needed ask portraits help translating, English changed lot, oldest portraits described first-year spells sounded awful lot like ones now. Draco recognized around half half sound powerful.  The sick feeling stomach grown answer finally, unable take more, he'd gone asked portraits Harry Potter's strange question Squib marriages, instead. The first five portraits known anyone finally he'd asked portraits ask acquaintances ask acquaintances managed find people who'd actually admit friends Squibs.  (The first-year Slytherin explained working important project Ravenclaw Ravenclaw told needed information run without saying why. This garnered many sympathetic looks.)  Draco's feet heavy walked corridors Hogwarts. He running seem muster energy. He kept thinking want know this, want involved this, want responsibility, let Harry Potter it, magic fading let Harry Potter take care it...  But Draco knew right.  Chill dungeons Slytherin, gray stone walls, Draco usually liked atmosphere, seemed much like fading.  His hand doorknob, Harry Potter already inside waiting, wearing cowled cloak.  "The ancient first-year spells," Harry Potter said. "What find?"  "They're powerful spells use now."  Harry Potter's fist struck desk, hard. "Damn it. All right. My experiment failure, Draco. There's something called Interdict Merlin -"  Draco hit forehead, realizing.  "- stops anyone getting knowledge powerful spells books, even find read powerful wizard's notes make sense you, go one living mind another. I find powerful spells instructions cast. But can't get old books, would anyone bother passing word mouth stopped working? Did get data Squib couples?"  Draco started hand parchment -  But Harry Potter held hand. "Law science, Draco. First I tell theory prediction. Then show data. That way know I'm making theory fit; know theory actually predicted data advance. I explain anyway, I explain show data. That's rule. So put cloak let's sit down."  Harry Potter sat desk torn scraps paper arranged across surface. Draco drew cloak bookbag, drew on, sat across Harry side, giving paper scraps puzzled look. They arranged two rows rows twenty scraps long.  "The secret blood," said Harry Potter, intense look face, "is something called deoxyribose nucleic acid. You say name front anyone who's scientist. Deoxyribose nucleic acid recipe tells body grow, two legs, two arms, short tall, whether brown eyes green. It's material thing, see microscopes, like telescopes look things small instead far away. And recipe two copies everything, always, case one copy broken. Imagine two long rows pieces paper. At place row, two pieces paper, children, body selects one piece paper random place row, mother's body same, child also gets two pieces paper place row. Two copies everything, one mother, one father, children get one piece paper random place."  As Harry spoke, fingers ranged paired scraps paper, pointing one part pair said "from mother", said "from father". And Harry talked picking piece paper random, hand pulled Knut robes flipped it; Harry looked coin, pointed top piece paper. All without pause speech.  "Now comes something like short tall, there's lot places recipe make little differences. So tall father marries short mother, child gets pieces paper saying 'tall' pieces paper saying 'short', usually child ends middle-sized. But always. By luck, child might get lot pieces saying 'tall', many papers saying 'short', grow pretty tall. You could tall father five papers saying 'tall' tall mother five papers saying 'tall' amazing luck child gets ten papers saying 'tall' ends taller them. You see? Blood perfect fluid, mix perfectly. Deoxyribose nucleic acid made lots little pieces, like glass pebbles instead glass water. That's child always exactly middle parents."  Draco listened mouth open. How Merlin's name Muggles figured out? They could see recipe?  "Now," Harry Potter said, "suppose that, like tallness, there's lots little places recipe piece paper says 'magic' 'not magic'. If enough pieces paper saying 'magic' wizard, lot pieces paper powerful wizard, Muggle, Squib. Then, two Squibs marry, time children also Squibs, child get lucky get father's magic papers mother's magic papers, strong enough wizard. But probably powerful one. If started lot powerful wizards married other, would stay powerful. But started marrying Muggleborns barely magical, Squibs... see? The blood mix perfectly, would glass pebbles, glass water, that's way blood works. There would still powerful wizards then, got lot magic papers luck. But powerful powerful wizards earlier."  Draco nodded slowly. He'd never heard explained way before. There surprising beauty exactly fit.  "But," Harry said. "That's one hypothesis. Suppose instead there's single place recipe makes wizard. Only one place piece paper say 'magic' 'not magic'. And two copies everything, always. So three possibilities. Both copies say 'magic'. One copy say 'magic' one copy say 'not magic'. Or copies say 'not magic'. Wizards, Squibs, Muggles. Muggleborns really born Muggles, would born two Squibs, two parents one magic copy who'd grown Muggle world. Now imagine witch marries Squib. Each child get one paper saying 'magic' mother, always, matter piece gets picked random, say 'magic'. But like flipping coin, half time child get paper saying 'magic' father, half time child get father's paper saying 'not magic'. When witch marries Squib, result lot weak wizarding children. Half children wizards witches powerful mother, half children Squibs. Because there's one place recipe makes wizard, magic like glass pebbles mix. It's like single magical pebble, sorcerer's stone."  Harry arranged three pairs papers side side. On one pair wrote 'magic' 'magic'. On another pair wrote 'magic' top paper only. And third pair left blank.  "In case," Harry said, "either two stones don't. Either wizard not. Powerful wizards would get way studying harder practicing more. And wizards get inherently less powerful, spells lost people can't cast them... maybe they're eating wrong foods something. But gotten steadily worse eight hundred years, could mean magic fading world."  Harry arranged another two pairs papers side side, took quill. Soon pair one piece paper saying 'magic' paper blank.  "And brings prediction," said Harry. "What happens two Squibs marry. Flip coin twice. It come heads heads, heads tails, tails heads, tails tails. So one quarter time get two heads, one quarter time get two tails, half time get one heads one tail. Same thing two Squibs marry. One quarter children would come magic magic, wizards. One quarter would come not-magic not-magic, Muggles. The half would Squibs. It's old classic pattern. It discovered Gregor Mendel forgotten, first hint ever uncovered recipe worked. Anyone knows anything blood science would recognize pattern instant. It exact, flip coin twice forty times always get exactly ten pairs two heads. But seven thirteen wizards forty children strong indicator. That's test I do. Now let's see data."  And Draco could even think, Harry Potter taken parchment Draco's hand.  Draco's throat dry.  Twenty-eight children.  He sure exact number pretty sure around fourth wizards.  "Six wizards twenty-eight children," Harry Potter said moment. "Well, that's that, then. And first-years casting spells power level eight centuries ago, too. Your test test came way."  There long silence classroom.  "What now?" Draco whispered.  He'd never terrified.  "It's definite yet," said Harry Potter. "My experiment failed, remember? I need design another test, Draco."  "I, I..." Draco said. His voice breaking. "I can't Harry, much me."  Harry's look fierce. "Yes can, to. I thought myself, too, I found Interdict Merlin. Draco, way observing strength magic directly? Some way anything wizards' blood spells learn?"  Draco's mind blank.  "Anything affects magic affects wizards," said Harry. "But can't tell wizards magic. What magic affect wizard?"  "Magical creatures, obviously," said Draco without even thinking it.  Harry Potter slowly smiled. "Draco, that's brilliant."  It's sort dumb question ask first place raised Muggles.  Then sickness Draco's stomach got even worse realized would mean magical creatures getting weaker. They would know certain magic fading, part Draco already sure exactly would find. He want see this, want know...  Harry Potter already halfway door. "Come on, Draco! There's portrait far here, we'll ask go get someone old find right away! We're cloaked, someone sees us run away! Let's go!"   It take long that.  It wide portrait, three people looking rather crowded. There middle-aged man twelfth century, dressed black swathes cloth; spoke sad-looking young woman fourteenth century, hair seemed constantly frizz head she'd charged static spell; spoke dignified, wizened old man seventeenth century solid gold bowtie; could understand.  They asked Dementors.  They asked phoenixes.  They asked dragons trolls house elves.  Harry frowned, pointed creatures needed magic could dying entirely, asked powerful magical creatures known.  There anything unfamiliar list, except species Dark creature called mind flayers translator noted finally exterminated Harold Shea, sound half scary Dementors.  Magical creatures powerful they'd ever been, apparently.  The sickness Draco's stomach easing, felt confused.  "Harry," Draco said middle old man translating list eleven powers beholder's eyes, "what mean?"  Harry held finger old man finished list.  Then Harry thanked portraits helping - Draco, pretty much automatic, well graciously - headed back classroom.  And Harry brought original parchment hypotheses, began scribbling.  Observation:  Wizardry powerful Hogwarts founded.  Hypotheses:  1. Magic fading.   2. Wizards interbreeding Muggles Squibs.   3. Knowledge cast powerful spells lost.   4. Wizards eating wrong foods children, something else besides blood making grow weaker.   5. Muggle technology interfering magic. (Since 800 years ago?)   6. Stronger wizards fewer children. (Draco = child? Check 3 powerful wizards, Quirrell / Dumbledore / Dark Lord, children.)  Tests:  A. Are spells know can't cast (1 2) lost spells longer known (3)? Result: Inconclusive due Interdict Merlin. No known uncastable spell, could simply passed on.  B. Did ancient first-year students cast sort spells, power, now? (Weak evidence 1 2, blood could also losing powerful wizardry only.) Result: Same level first-year spells now.  C. Additional test distinguishes 1 2 using scientific knowledge blood, explain later. Result: There's one place recipe makes wizard, either two papers saying 'magic' don't.  D. Are magical creatures losing powers? Distinguishes 1 (2 3). Result: Magical creatures seem strong ever were.  "A failed," said Harry Potter. "B weak evidence 1 2. C falsifies 2. D falsifies 1. 4 unlikely B argues 4 well. 5 unlikely D argues it. 6 falsified along 2. That leaves 3. Interdict Merlin not, I actually find known spell cast. So add up, looks like knowledge lost."  And trap snapped shut.  As soon panic went away, soon Draco understood magic fading out, took five seconds realize.  Draco shoved away desk stood hard chair skittered scraping noise across floor fell over.  "So stupid trick, then."  Harry Potter stared moment, still sitting. When spoke, voice quiet. "It fair test, Draco. If come different way, I would accepted it. That's something I would ever cheat on. Ever. I look data I made predictions. I told front Interdict Merlin invalidated first experiment -"  "Oh," Draco said, anger starting come voice, "you know whole thing going come out?"  "I know anything know," Harry said, still quietly. "I admit I suspected. Hermione Granger powerful, barely magical wasn't, Muggleborn best spellcaster Hogwarts? And getting best grades essays too, much coincidence one girl strongest magically academically unless there's single cause. Hermione Granger's existence pointed one thing makes wizard, something either don't, power differences coming much know much practice. And different classes purebloods Muggleborns, on. There many ways world look way would look right. But Draco, I see anything see too. I perform tests I tell about. I cheat, Draco. I wanted us work answer together. And I never thought magic might fading world said it. It scary idea me, too."  "Whatever," Draco said. He working hard control voice start screaming Harry. "You claim going run tell anyone else this."  "Not without consulting first," Harry said. He opened hands pleading gesture. "Draco, I'm nice I world turned way."  "Fine. Then I through. I'm going walk away forget ever happened."  Draco spun around, feeling burning sensation throat, sense betrayal, realized really liked Harry Potter, thought slow moment strode toward classroom door.  And Harry Potter's voice came, louder, worried:  "Draco... can't forget. Don't understand? That sacrifice."  Draco stopped midstride turned around. "What talking about?"  But already freezing coldness Draco's spine.  He knew even Harry Potter said it.  "To become scientist. You questioned one beliefs, small belief something great significance you. You experiments, gathered data, outcome proved belief wrong. You saw results understood meant." Harry Potter's voice faltering. "Remember, Draco, can't sacrifice true belief way, experiments confirm instead falsifying it. Your sacrifice become scientist false belief wizard blood mixing getting weaker."  "That's true!" said Draco. "I sacrifice belief. I still believe that!" His voice getting louder, chill getting worse.  Harry Potter shook head. His voice came whisper. "Draco... I'm sorry, Draco, believe it, anymore." Harry's voice rose again. "I'll prove you. Imagine someone tells they're keeping dragon house. You tell want see it. They say invisible dragon. You say fine, listen move. They say inaudible dragon. You say throw cooking flour air see outline dragon. They say dragon permeable flour. And telling thing know, advance, exactly experimental results they'll explain away. They know everything come way there's dragon, know advance excuses they'll make. So maybe say there's dragon. Maybe believe believe there's dragon, called belief-in-belief. But actually believe it. You mistaken believe, people never realize there's difference believing something thinking good believe it." Harry Potter risen desk now, taken steps toward Draco. "And Draco, believe blood purism, I'll show don't. If blood purism true, Hermione Granger make sense, could explain her? Maybe wizarding orphan raised Muggles, like I was? I could go Granger ask see pictures parents, see looks like them. Would expect look different? Should go perform test?"  "They would put relatives," Draco said, voice trembling. "They'll still look same."  "You see. You already know experimental result excuse. If still believed blood purism would say, sure, let's go take look, I bet look like parents, powerful real Muggleborn -"  "They would put relatives!"  "Scientists tests check sure someone true child father. Granger would probably I paid family enough. She afraid results. So expect test show? Tell run will. But already know test say. You'll always know. You ever able forget. You might wish believed blood purism, always expect see happen exactly would happen one thing made wizard. That sacrifice become scientist."  Draco's breathing ragged. "Do realize done?" Draco surged forward seized Harry collar robes. His voice rose scream, sounded unbearably loud closed classroom silence. "Do realize done?"  Harry's voice shaky. "You belief. The belief false. I helped see that. What's true already so, owning make worse -"  The fingers Draco's right hand clenched fist hand dropped blasted unstoppably punched Harry Potter jaw hard body went crashing back desk floor.  "Idiot!" screamed Draco. "Idiot! Idiot!"  "Draco," whispered Harry floor, "Draco, I'm sorry, I think would happen months, I expect awaken scientist quickly, I thought I would longer prepare you, teach techniques make hurt less admit wrong -"  "What Father?" Draco said. His voice trembled rage. "Were going prepare care happened this?"  "You can't tell him!" Harry said, voice rising alarm. "He's scientist! You promised, Draco!"  For moment thought Father knowing came relief.  And real anger started rise.  "So planned lie tell I still believe," Draco said, voice shaking. "I'll always lie him, I grow I can't Death Eater, I even able tell not."  "If father really loves you," whispered Harry floor, "he'll still love even become Death Eater, sounds like father really love you, Draco -"  "Your stepfather scientist," Draco said. The words coming like biting knives. "If going scientist, would still love you. But little less special him."  Harry flinched. The boy opened mouth, say 'I'm sorry', closed mouth, seeming think better it, either smart lucky, Draco might tried kill him.  "You warned me," Draco said. His voice rose. "You warned me!"  "I... I did... every time I told power, I told price. I said, admit wrong. I said would hardest path you. That sacrifice anyone make become scientist. I said, experiment says one thing family friends say another -"  "You call warning?" Draco screaming now. "You call warning? When we're ritual calls permanent sacrifice?"  "I... I..." The boy floor swallowed. "I guess maybe clear. I'm sorry. But destroyed truth be."  Hitting enough.  "You're wrong one thing," Draco said, voice deadly. "Granger strongest student Hogwarts. She gets best grades class. You're find difference."  Sudden shock showed Harry's face, tried roll quickly feet -  It already late him.  "Expelliarmus!"  Harry's wand flew across room.  "Gom jabbar!"  A pulse inky blackness struck Harry's left hand.  "That's torture spell," said Draco. "It's getting information people. I'm going leave lock door behind I go. Maybe I'll set locking spell wear hours. Maybe wear die here. Have fun."  Draco moved smoothly backward, wand still Harry. Draco's hand dipped down, picked bookbag, without aim wavering.  The pain already showing Harry Potter's face spoke. "Malfoys underage magic laws, I take it? It's blood stronger. It's already practiced. In beginning weak us. Is prediction wrong?"  Draco's hand whitened wand, aim stayed steady.  "Just know," Harry said gritted teeth, "if told I wrong I would listened. I ever torture show I'm wrong. And will. Someday. You're awakened scientist now, even never learn use power, always," Harry gasped, "be looking, ways, test, beliefs -"  Draco's backing away less smooth, now, little faster, work keep wand Harry reached back open door stepped back classroom.  Then Draco shut door again.  He cast powerful locking Charm knew.  Draco waited heard Harry's first scream casting Quietus.  And walked away.   "Aaahhhhh! Finite Incantatem! Aaaahhh!"  Harry's left hand put pot boiling cooking oil left there. He'd put everything Finite Incantatem still working.  Some hexes required specific counters undo them, maybe Draco much stronger.  "Aaaaahhhh!"  Harry's hand really starting hurt, now, interfering attempts think creatively.  But screams later, Harry realized do.  His pouch, unfortunately, wrong side body, took twisting reach it, especially arm flailing around reflex, unstoppable attempt fling source pain. By time managed arm managed throw away wand again.  "Medical ahhhhh kit! Medical kit!"  On floor, green light dim see by.  Harry stand. He crawl. He rolled across floor thought wand was, there, one hand managed raise high enough see wand, rolled there, got wand, rolled back medical kit opened. There also good deal screaming, bit throwing up.  It took eight tries Harry could cast Lumos.  And then, well, package designed opened one-handed, wizards idiots, why. Harry use teeth took Harry finally managed wrap Numbcloth left hand.  When feeling left hand finally gone, Harry let mind come apart, lay motionless floor, cried while.  Well, Harry's mind said silently itself, recovered enough think words again. Was worth it?  Slowly, Harry's functional hand reached desk.  Harry pulled feet.  Took deep breath.  Exhaled.  Smiled.  It much smile, smile nonetheless.  Thank you, Professor Quirrell, I lost without you.  He redeemed Draco yet, even close. Contrary Draco might believe, Draco still child Death Eater, through. Still boy who'd grown thinking "rape" something cool older kids did. But one heck start.  Harry claim gone planned. It gone completely made spot. The plan called happen December thereabouts, Harry taught Draco techniques deny evidence saw it.  But he'd seen look fear Draco's face, realized Draco already taking alternative hypothesis seriously, seized moment. One case true curiosity sort redeeming power rationality one case true love movies.  In retrospect, Harry given hours make important discovery history magic, months break undeveloped mental barriers eleven-year-old boy. This could indicate Harry sort major cognitive deficit respect estimating task completion times.  Was Harry going Science Hell he'd done? Harry sure. He'd contrived keep Draco's mind possibility magic fading, made sure Draco would carry part experiment would seem first point direction. He'd waited explaining genetics prompt Draco realizing magical creatures (though Harry thought terms ancient artifacts like Sorting Hat, one could duplicate anymore, continued function). But Harry actually exaggerated evidence, distorted meaning results. When Interdict Merlin invalidated test definitive, he'd told Draco front.  And part that...  But actually lied Draco. Draco believed it, would make true.  The end, admittedly, fun.  Harry turned, staggered toward door.  Time test Draco's locking spell.  The first step simply trying turn doorknob. Draco could bluffing.  Draco bluffing.  "Finite Incantatem." Harry's voice came rather hoarse, could feel spell taken.  So Harry tried again, time felt true. But another twist doorknob showed worked. No surprise there.  Time bring big guns. Harry drew deep breath. This spell one powerful he'd learned far.  "Alohomora!"  Harry staggered little saying it.  And classroom door still open.  That shocked Harry. Harry planning go anywhere near Dumbledore's forbidden corridor, course. But spell open magical locks seemed like useful sort spell anyway, Harry learned it. Was Dumbledore's forbidden corridor meant lure people stupid notice security worse Draco Malfoy could put it?  Fear creeping back Harry's system. The placard medical kit said Numbcloth could safely used thirty minutes. After would come automatically, reusable 24 hours. Right 6:51pm. He'd put Numbcloth five minutes ago.  So Harry took step back, considered door. It solid panel dark oaken wood, interrupted brass metal doorknob.  Harry know explosive cutting smashing spells, Transfiguring explosive would violated rule Transfiguring things burned. Acid liquid would made fumes...  But obstacle creative thinker.  Harry laid wand one door's brass hinges, concentrated form cotton pure abstraction apart material cotton, also pure material apart pattern made brass hinge, brought two concepts together, imposing shape substance. An hour Transfiguration practice every day month gotten Harry point could Transfigure subject five cubic centimeters minute.  After two minutes hinge changed all.  Whoever designed Draco's locking spell, they'd thought that, too. Or door part Hogwarts castle immune.  A glance showed walls solid stone. So floor. So ceiling. You separately Transfigure part something solid whole; Harry would needed try Transfiguring whole wall, would taken hours maybe days continuous effort, could done all, wall contiguous rest whole castle...  Harry's Time-Turner open 9pm. After could go back 6pm, door locked.  How long would torture spell last?  Harry swallowed hard. Tears coming eyes again.  His brilliantly creative mind offered ingenious suggestion Harry could cut hand using hacksaw toolset stored pouch, would hurt, obviously, might hurt lot less Draco's pain spell, since nerves would gone; tourniquets healer's kit.  And obviously hideously stupid idea Harry would regret rest entire life.  But Harry know could hold two hours torture.  He wanted classroom, wanted classroom now, want wait screaming two hours could use Time-Turner, needed get find someone get torture spell hand...  Think! Harry screamed brain. Think! Think!   The Slytherin dorm mostly empty. People dinner. For reason Draco feeling hungry.  Draco closed door private room, locked it, Charmed shut, Quieted it, sat bed, started cry.  It fair.  It fair.  It first time Draco ever really lost before, Father warned losing real would hurt first time happened, he'd lost much, fair, fair lose everything first time lost.  Somewhere dungeons, boy Draco actually liked screaming pain. Draco never hurt anyone he'd liked before. Punishing people deserved supposed fun, felt sick inside. Father warned that, Draco wondered hard lesson everyone learn grew up, Draco weak.  Draco wished Pansy screaming. That would felt better.  And worst part knowing might mistake hurt Harry Potter.  Who else Draco now? Dumbledore? After he'd done? Draco would sooner burned alive.  Draco would go back Harry Potter nowhere else go. And Harry Potter said want him, Draco would nothing, pathetic little boy could never Death Eater, never join Dumbledore's faction, never learn science.  The trap perfectly set, perfectly executed. Father warned Draco over sacrificed Dark rituals regained. But Father known accursed Muggles invented rituals need wands, rituals could tricked without knowing it, one terrible secrets scientists knew Harry Potter brought him.  Draco started crying harder, then.  He want this, want turning back. It late. He already scientist.  Draco knew go back free Harry Potter apologize. It would smart thing do.  Instead Draco stayed bed sobbed.  He'd already hurt Harry Potter. It might time Draco ever got hurt him, would hold one memory rest life.  Let keep screaming.   Harry dropped remnants hacksaw ground. The brass hinges proved impervious, even scratched, Harry beginning suspect even desperation act trying Transfigure acid explosives would failed open door. On plus side, attempt destroyed hacksaw.  His watch said 7:02pm, less fifteen minutes left, Harry tried remember sharp things pouch needed destroying, felt another fit tears welling up. If only, Time-Turner opened, could go back prevent -  And Harry realized silly.  It first time he'd locked room.  Professor McGonagall already told correct way this.  ...she'd also told use Time-Turner sort thing.  Would Professor McGonagall realize occasion really warrant special exception? Or take away Time-Turner entirely?  Harry gathered things, evidence, pouch. A Scourgify took care vomit floor, though sweat soaked robes. He left overturned desks overturned, important enough worth one hand.  When done, Harry glanced watch. 7:04pm.  And Harry waited. Seconds passed, feeling like years.  At 7:07pm, door opened.  Professor Flitwick's puff-bearded face looked rather concerned. "Are right, Harry?" said squeaky voice Ravenclaw's Head House. "I got note saying locked -"   Chapter 24: Machiavellian Intelligence Hypothesis  J. K. Rowling coils strikes, unseen; Orca circles, hard lean.   Act 3:   Draco waited small windowed alcove he'd found near Great Hall, stomach churning.  There would price, would small. Draco known soon he'd woken realized dare enter Great Hall breakfast might see Harry Potter Draco know would happen that.  Footsteps approached.  "Here ya go," said Vincent's voice. "Now da boss ain't good mood today, ya'd better watch step."  Draco going skin idiot alive send back flayed body request intelligent servant, like dead gerbil.  One set footsteps went off, set footsteps came closer.  The churning Draco's stomach got worse.  Harry Potter came sight. His face carefully neutral, blue-trimmed robes looked oddly askew, put quite right -  "Your hand," Draco said without thinking all.  Harry raised left arm, though look himself.  The hand dangled limply it, like something dead.  "Madam Pomfrey said permanent," Harry said quietly. "She said mostly recover time classes start tomorrow."  For single instant news came relief.  And Draco realized.  "You went Madam Pomfrey," whispered Draco.  "Of course I did," said Harry Potter, though stating obvious. "My hand working."  It slowly dawning Draco absolute fool he'd been, far worse older Slytherins he'd chewed out.  He'd taken granted one would go authorities Malfoy something them. That one would want Lucius Malfoy's eye them, ever.  But Harry Potter frightened little Hufflepuff trying stay game. He already playing it, Father's eye already him.  "What else Madam Pomfrey say?" said Draco, heart throat.  "Professor Flitwick said spell cast hand Dark torture hex extremely serious business, refusing say absolutely unacceptable."  There long pause.  "And then?" Draco said shaking voice.  Harry Potter smiled slightly. "I apologized deeply, made Professor Flitwick look stern, I told Professor Flitwick whole thing was, indeed, extremely serious, secret, delicate business, I'd already informed Headmaster project."  Draco gasped. "No! Flitwick going accept that! He'll check Dumbledore!"  "Indeed," said Harry Potter. "I promptly hauled Headmaster's office."  Draco trembling now. If Dumbledore brought Harry Potter Wizengamot, willingly otherwise, Boy-Who-Lived testify Veritaserum Draco tortured him... many people loved Harry Potter, Father could lose vote...  Father might able convince Dumbledore that, would cost. Cost terribly. The game rules now, threaten someone random more. But Draco walked Dumbledore's hands free will. And Draco valuable hostage.  Though since Draco Death Eater now, valuable Father thought.  The thought tore heart like Cutting Charm.  "Then what?" whispered Draco.  "Dumbledore deduced immediately you. He knew we'd associating."  The worst possible scenario. If Dumbledore guessed it, might risked using Legilimency find out... Dumbledore knew...  "And?" Draco forced word.  "We little chat."  "And?"  Harry Potter grinned. "And I explained would best interest anything."  Draco's mind ran brick wall splattered. He stared Harry Potter mouth hanging slack like fool.  It took long Draco remember.  Harry knew Dumbledore's mysterious secret, one Snape used hold.  Draco could see now. Dumbledore looking stern, concealing eagerness explained Harry terribly serious matter was.  And Harry politely telling Dumbledore keep mouth shut knew good him.  Father warned Draco people like this, people could ruin still likable hard hate properly.  "After which," Harry said, "the Headmaster told Professor Flitwick was, indeed, secret delicate matter already informed, think pressing time would help anyone. Professor Flitwick started say something Headmaster's usual plotting going much far, I interrupt point explain idea anything Headmaster forced into, Professor Flitwick spun around started lecturing me, Headmaster interrupted said Boy-Who-Lived I doomed weird dangerous adventures I safer I got purpose instead waiting happen accident, Professor Flitwick threw little hands started shrieking high-pitched voice us care cooking together, ever happen long I Ravenclaw House would thrown I could go Gryffindor Dumbledoring belonged -"  Harry making hard Draco hate him.  "Anyway," Harry said, "I want thrown Ravenclaw, I promised Professor Flitwick nothing like would happen again, did, I would tell it."  Harry's eyes cold. They weren't. The voice made deadly threat. It wasn't.  And Draco saw question obvious, killed mood instant.  "Why... you?"  Harry walked window, small beam sunlight shining alcove, turned head outward, toward green grounds Hogwarts. The brightness shone him, robes, face.  "Why I?" Harry said. His voice caught. "I guess I get angry you. I knew I'd hurt first. I even call fair, I worse me."  It like running another brick wall. Harry could speaking archaic Greek Draco understood then.  Draco's mind scrabbled patterns came flat blank. The statement concession Harry's best interests. It even Harry say make Draco loyal servant, Harry held power him. For Harry emphasizing kindly he'd been, much he'd hurt Draco.  "Even so," Harry said, voice lower, almost whisper, "please again, Draco. It hurt, I'm sure I could forgive second time. I'm sure I'd able want to."  Draco get it.  Was Harry trying friends him?  There way Harry Potter could dumb enough believe still possible he'd done.  You could someone's friend ally, like Draco tried Harry, could destroy life leave options. Not both.  But Draco understand else Harry could trying.  And strange thought came Draco then, something Harry kept talking yesterday.  And thought was: Test it.  You're awakened scientist now, Harry said, even never learn use power, always, looking, ways, test, beliefs... Those ominous words, spoken gasps agony, kept running Draco's mind.  If Harry pretending repentant friend accidentally hurt someone...  "You planned me!" Draco said, managing put note accusation voice. "You got angry, wanted to!"  Fool, Harry Potter would say, course I planned it, mine -  Harry turned back toward Draco. "What happened yesterday plan," Harry said, voice seeming stuck throat. "The plan I would teach always better knowing truth, would try together discover truth blood, whatever answer would accept it. Yesterday I... rushed things."  "Always better knowing truth," Draco said coldly. "Like favor."  Harry nodded, blowing Draco's mind completely, said, "What Lucius comes idea I did, problem stronger wizards fewer children? He might start program pay strongest purebloods children. In fact, blood purism right, that's Lucius - addressing problem side, make things happen right away. Right now, Draco, friend Lucius would try stop wasting effort, one knows real truth predict real results."  The thought came Draco Harry Potter raised place strange effectively magical creature rather wizard. Draco simply guess Harry would say next.  "Why?" Draco said. Putting pain betrayal voice hard all. "Why me? What plan?"  "Well," Harry said, "you're Lucius's heir, believe not, Dumbledore thinks I belong him. So could grow fight battles other. Or could something else."  Slowly, Draco's mind wrapped around this. "You want provoke fight finish them, seize power they're exhausted." Draco felt cold dread chest. He would try stop matter cost -  But Harry shook head. "Stars above, no!"  "No...?"  "You go along neither would I," said Harry. "This world, want break it. But imagine, say, Lucius thought Conspiracy tool side, Dumbledore thought Conspiracy tool I side, Lucius thought turned Dumbledore believed Conspiracy mine, Dumbledore thought I'd turned Lucius believed Conspiracy yours, helped us ways one notice."  Draco fake speechless.  Father taken see play called The Tragedy Light, incredibly clever Slytherin named Light who'd set purify world evil using ancient ring could kill anyone whose name face knew, who'd opposed another incredibly clever Slytherin, villain named Lawliet, who'd worn disguise conceal true face; Draco shouted cheered right parts, especially middle; play ended sadly Draco hugely disappointed Father gently pointed word 'Tragedy' right title.  Afterward, Father asked Draco understood gone see play.  Draco said teach cunning Light Lawliet grew up.  Father said Draco possibly wrong, pointed Lawliet cleverly concealed face good reason tell Light name. Father gone demolish almost every part play, Draco listened eyes growing wider wider. And Father finished saying plays like always unrealistic, playwright known someone actually smart Light would actually do, playwright would tried take world instead writing plays it.  That Father told Draco Rule Three, plot required three different things happen would never work real life.  Father explained since fool would attempt plot complicated possible, real limit two.  Draco even find words describe sheer gargantuan unworkability Harry's master plan.  But sort mistake would make mentors thought clever learned plotting watching plays.  "So," said Harry, "what think plan?"  "It's clever..." Draco said slowly. Shouting brilliant! gasping awe would looked suspicious. "Harry, I ask question?"  "Sure," said Harry.  "Why buy Granger expensive pouch?"  "To show hard feelings," said Harry once. "Though I expect she'll also feel awkward refuses small requests I make next couple months."  And Draco realized Harry actually trying friend.  Harry's move Granger smart, maybe even brilliant. Make enemy suspect you, put debt friendly way could maneuver position asking them. Draco gotten away that, target would suspicious, Boy-Who-Lived could. So first step Harry's plot give enemy expensive present, Draco thought that, could work...     If Harry's enemy, plots might hard see first, might even stupid, reasoning would make sense understood it, would comprehend trying hurt you.  The way Harry acting toward Draco right make sense.  Because Harry's friend, tried friends alien, incomprehensible way he'd raised Muggles do, even meant destroying entire life.  The silence stretched.  "I know I've abused friendship terribly," Harry said finally. "But please realize, Draco, end, I wanted two us find truth together. Is something forgive?"  A fork two paths, one path easy go back later Draco changed mind...  "I guess I understand trying do," Draco lied, "so yes."  Harry's eyes lit up. "I'm glad hear that, Draco," said softly.  The two students stood alcove, Harry still dipped lone sunbeam, Draco shadow.  And Draco realized note horror despair, although terrifying fate indeed Harry's friend, Harry many different avenues threatening Draco enemy would even worse.  Probably.  Maybe.  Well, could always switch enemies later...  He doomed.  "So," Draco said. "Now what?"  "We study next Saturday?"  "It better go like last one -"  "Don't worry, won't," said Harry. "A Saturdays like ahead me."  Harry laughed. Draco didn't.  "Oh, go," Harry said, grinned sheepishly. "I know bad time, I wanted ask advice something, actually."  "Okay," Draco said, still bit distracted last statement.  Harry's eyes grew intent. "Buying pouch Granger used gold I managed steal Gringotts vault -"  What.  "- McGonagall vault key, Dumbledore now, maybe. And I launch plot might take money, I wondering know I get access -"  "I'll loan money," said Draco's mouth sheer existential reflex.  Harry looked taken aback, pleased way. "Draco, -"  "How much?"  Harry named amount Draco quite keep shock showing face. That almost spending money Father given Draco last whole year, Draco would left Galleons -  Then Draco mentally kicked himself. All write Father explain money gone managed loan Harry Potter, Father would send special congratulatory note written golden ink, giant Chocolate Frog would take two weeks eat, ten times many Galleons case Harry Potter needed another loan.  "It's way much, it," said Harry. "I'm sorry, I asked -"  "Excuse me, I Malfoy, know," said Draco. "I surprised wanted much."  "Don't worry," Harry Potter said cheerfully. "It's nothing threatens family's interests, evil."  Draco nodded. "No problem, then. You want go get right now?"  "Sure," said Harry.  As left alcove started heading toward dungeons, Draco help ask, "So tell plot for?"  "Rita Skeeter."  Draco thought bad words himself, far late say no.   By time they'd reached dungeons, Draco started pulling together thoughts again.  He trouble hating Harry Potter. Harry trying friendly, insane.  And going stop Draco's revenge even slow down.  "So," Draco said, looking around make certain one nearby. Their voices would Blurred, course, never hurt extra sure. "I've thinking. When bring new recruits Conspiracy, they're going to think we're equals. Otherwise would take one blow plot Father. You already worked out, right?"  "Naturally," said Harry.  "Will equals?" said Draco.  "I'm afraid not," Harry said. It clear trying sound gentle, also clear trying suppress good deal condescension quite succeeding. "I'm sorry, Draco, even know word Bayesian Bayesian Conspiracy means right now. You're going to study months take anyone else in, put good front."  "Because I know enough science," Draco said, carefully keeping voice neutral.  Harry shook head that. "The problem ignorant specific science things like deoxyribose nucleic acid. That stop equal. The problem trained methods rationality, deeper secret knowledge behind discoveries got made first place. I'll try teach those, they're lot harder learn. Think yesterday, Draco. Yes, work. But I one control. You answered questions. I asked them. You helped push. I steering myself. And without methods rationality, Draco, can't possibly steer Conspiracy needs go."  "I see," said Draco, voice sounding disappointed.  Harry's voice tried gentle even more. "I'll try respect expertise, Draco, things like people stuff. But need respect expertise too, there's way could equal comes steering Conspiracy. You've scientist one day, know one secret deoxyribose nucleic acid, trained methods rationality."  "I understand," said Draco.  And did.  People stuff, Harry said. Seizing control Conspiracy probably even difficult. And afterward, would kill Harry Potter sure -  The memory rose Draco sick inside felt last night, knowing Harry screaming.  Draco thought bad words.  Fine. He kill Harry. Harry raised Muggles, fault insane.  Instead, Harry would live on, Draco could tell Harry's good, really, ought grateful -  And sudden twitch surprised pleasure, Draco realized actually Harry's good. If Harry tried carry plan playing Dumbledore Father fools, would die.  That made perfect.  Draco would take Harry's dreams away him, Harry done him.  Draco would tell Harry good, would absolutely true.  Draco would wield Conspiracy power science purify wizarding world, Father would proud he'd Death Eater.  Harry Potter's evil plots would foiled, forces right would prevail.  The perfect revenge.  Unless...  Just pretend pretending scientist, Harry told him.  Draco words describe exactly wrong Harry's mind -  (since Draco never heard term depth recursion)  - could guess sort plots implied.  ...unless exactly Harry wanted Draco part even larger plot Draco would play right trying foil one, Harry might even know plan unworkable, might purpose except luring Draco thwart -  No. That way lay madness. There limit. The Dark Lord twisty. That sort thing happen real life, Father's silly bedtime stories foolish gargoyles always ended furthering hero's plans every time tried stop him.   And beside Draco, Harry walked along smile face, thinking evolutionary origins human intelligence.  In beginning, people quite understood evolution worked, they'd gone around thinking crazy ideas like human intelligence evolved could invent better tools.  The reason crazy one person tribe invent tool, everyone else would use it, would spread tribes, still used descendants hundred years later. That great perspective scientific progress, evolutionary terms, meant person invented something much fitness advantage, many children everyone else. Only relative fitness advantages could increase relative frequency gene population, drive lonely mutation point universal everyone it. And brilliant inventions common enough provide sort consistent selection pressure took promote mutation. It natural guess, looked humans guns tanks nuclear weapons compared chimpanzees, intelligence make technology. A natural guess, wrong.  Before people quite understood evolution worked, they'd gone around thinking crazy ideas like climate changed, tribes migrate, people become smarter order solve novel problems.  But human beings four times brain size chimpanzee. 20% human's metabolic energy went feeding brain. Humans ridiculously smarter species. That sort thing happen environment stepped difficulty problems little. Then organisms would get little smarter solve them. Ending gigantic outsized brain must taken sort runaway evolutionary process, something would push push without limits.  And today's scientists pretty good guess runaway evolutionary process been.  Harry read famous book called Chimpanzee Politics. The book described adult chimpanzee named Luit confronted aging alpha, Yeroen, help young, recently matured chimpanzee named Nikkie. Nikkie intervened directly fights Luit Yeroen, prevented Yeroen's supporters tribe coming aid, distracting whenever confrontation developed Luit Yeroen. And time Luit won, become new alpha, Nikkie second powerful...  ...though taken long Nikkie form alliance defeated Yeroen, overthrow Luit, become new new alpha.  It really made appreciate millions years hominids trying outwit - evolutionary arms race without limit - led way increased mental capacity.  'Cause, y'know, human would totally seen one coming.   And beside Harry, Draco walked along, suppressing smile thought revenge.  Someday, maybe years someday, Harry Potter would learn meant underestimate Malfoy.  Draco awakened scientist single day. Harry said supposed happen months.  But course Malfoy, would powerful scientist anyone wasn't.  So Draco would learn Harry Potter's methods rationality, time ripe -   Chapter 25: Hold Off Proposing Solutions  To seek new life, J. K. Rowling!  Note: Since science story usually correct, I include warning Ch. 22-25 Harry overlooks many possibilities, important lots magical genes they're one chromosome (which happen naturally, chromosome might engineered). In case, inheritance pattern would Mendelian, magical chromosome could still degraded chromosomal crossover nonmagical homologue. (Harry read Mendel chromosomes science history books, studied enough actual genetics know chromosomal crossover. Hey, he's eleven.) However, although modern science journal would find lot nits pick, everything Harry presents strong evidence fact strong evidence - possibilities improbable.   Act 2:  (The sun shone brilliantly Great Hall enchanted sky-ceiling above, illuminating students though sat beneath naked sky, gleaming plates bowls, as, refreshed night's sleep, inhaled breakfast preparation whatever plans they'd made Sunday.)  So. There one thing made wizard.  That surprising, thought it. What DNA mostly tell ribosomes chain amino acids together proteins. Conventional physics seemed quite capable describing amino acids, matter many amino acids chained together, conventional physics said would never, ever get magic it.  And yet magic seemed hereditary, following DNA.  Then probably DNA chaining together nonmagical amino acids magical proteins.  Rather key DNA sequence not, itself, give magic all.  Magic came somewhere else.  (At Ravenclaw table one boy staring space, right hand automatically spooned unimportant food mouth whatever front him. You probably could substituted pile dirt noticed.)  And reason Source Magic paying attention particular DNA marker among individuals ordinary ape-descended humans every way.  (Actually quite lot boys girls staring space. It Ravenclaw table, all.)  There lines logic leading conclusion. Complex machinery always universal within sexually reproducing species. If gene B relied gene A, A useful own, rise near-universality gene pool own, B would useful often enough confer fitness advantage. Then B universal would get variant A relied B, C relied A B, B relied C, whole machine would fall apart removed single piece. But happen incrementally - evolution never looked ahead, evolution would never start promoting B preparation A becoming universal later. Evolution simple historical fact that, whichever organisms fact children, genes would fact frequent next generation. So piece complex machine become nearly universal pieces machine would evolve depend presence.  So complex, interdependent machinery, powerful sophisticated protein machines drove life, always universal within sexually reproducing species - except small handful non-interdependent variants selected given time, complexity slowly laid down. It human beings underlying brain design, emotions, facial expressions wired emotions; adaptations complex, universal.  If magic like that, big complex adaptation lots necessary genes, wizard mating Muggle would resulted child half parts half machine much. And would Muggleborns, ever. Even pieces individually gotten Muggle gene pool, they'd never reassemble one place form wizard.  There genetically isolated valley humans stumbled onto evolutionary pathway leading sophisticated magical sections brain. That complex genetic machinery, wizards interbred Muggles, would never reassembled Muggleborns.  So however genes made wizard, containing blueprints complicated machinery.  That reason Harry guessed Mendelian pattern would there. If magical genes complicated, would one?  And yet magic seemed pretty complicated. A door-locking spell would prevent door opening prevent Transfiguring hinges resist Finite Incantatem Alohomora. Many elements pointing direction: could call goal-orientation, simpler language, purposefulness.  There two known causes purposeful complexity. Natural selection, produced things like butterflies. And intelligent engineering, produced things like cars.  Magic seem like something self-replicated existence. Spells purposefully complicated, not, like butterfly, complicated purpose making copies themselves. Spells complicated purpose serving user, like car.  Some intelligent engineer, then, created Source Magic, told pay attention particular DNA marker.  The obvious next thought something "Atlantis".  Harry asked Hermione earlier - train Hogwarts, hearing Draco say - far knew, nothing known word itself.  It might pure legend. But also plausible enough civilization magic-users, especially one Interdict Merlin, would managed blow up.  The line reasoning continued: Atlantis isolated civilization somehow brought Source Magic, told serve people Atlantean genetic marker, blood Atlantis.  And similar logic: The words wizard spoke, wand movements, complicated enough build spell effects scratch - way three billion base pairs human DNA actually complicated enough build human body scratch, way computer programs took thousands bytes data.  So words wand movements triggers, levers pulled hidden complex machine. Buttons, blueprints.  And like computer program compile made single spelling error, Source Magic respond unless cast spells exactly right way.  The chain logic inexorable.  And led inevitably toward single final conclusion.  The ancient forebears wizards, thousands years earlier, told Source Magic levitate things said...  'Wingardium Leviosa.'  Harry slumped breakfast table, resting forehead wearily right hand.  There story dawn days Artificial Intelligence - back starting one yet realized problem would difficult - professor delegated one grad students solve problem computer vision.  Harry beginning understand grad student must felt.  This could take while.  Why take effort cast Alohomora spell, like pressing button?  Who'd silly enough build spell Avada Kedavra could cast using hatred?  Why wordless Transfiguration require make complete mental separation concept form concept material?  Harry might done problem time graduated Hogwarts. He could still working problem thirty years old. Hermione right, Harry realized gut level before. He'd given inspiring speech determination.  Harry's mind briefly considered whether get gut level might never solve problem all, decided would taking things much far.  Besides, long could get far immortality first decades, he'd fine.  What method Dark Lord used? Come think, fact Dark Lord somehow managed survive death first body almost infinitely important fact he'd tried take magical Britain -  "Excuse me," said expected voice behind unexpected tones. "At convenience, Mr. Malfoy requests favor conversation."  Harry choke breakfast cereal. Instead turned around beheld Mr. Crabbe.  "Excuse me," said Harry. "Don't mean 'Da boss wants ta talk wid youse?'"  Mr. Crabbe look happy. "Mr. Malfoy instructed speak properly."  "I can't hear you," Harry said. "You're speaking properly." He turned back bowl tiny blue crystal snowflakes deliberately ate another spoonful.  "Da boss wants talk youse," came threatening voice behind him. "Ya'd better come see ya know what's good ya."  There. Now everything going according plan.   Act 1:  "A reason?" said old wizard. He restrained fury face. The boy victim, certainly need frightened further. "There nothing excuse -"  "What I worse."  The old wizard stiffened sudden horror. "Harry, done?"  "I tricked Draco believing I'd tricked participating ritual sacrificed belief blood purism. And meant Death Eater grew up. He'd lost everything, Headmaster."  There long quiet office, broken tiny puffs whistles fiddly things, enough time come seem like silence.  "Dear me," said old wizard, "I feel silly. And I expecting might try redeem heir Malfoy by, say, showing true friendship kindness."  "Ha! Yeah, like would worked."  The old wizard sighed. This taking far. "Tell me, Harry. Did even occur something incongruous setting redeem someone lies trickery?"  "I without telling direct lies, since we're talking Draco Malfoy here, I think word looking congruous." The boy looked rather smug.  The old wizard shook head despair. "And hero. We're doomed."   Act 5:  The long, narrow tunnel rough stone, unlit except child's wand, seemed stretch miles.  The reason simple: It stretch miles.  The time three morning, Fred George starting long way secret passage led statue one-eyed witch Hogwarts, cellar Honeydukes candyshop Hogsmeade.  "How's doing?" said Fred low voice.  (Not there'd anyone listening, something odd talking normal voice going secret passage.)  "Still fritz," said George.  "Both, -"  "Intermittent one fixed again. Other one's ever."  The Map extraordinarily powerful artifact, capable tracking every sentient school grounds, real time, name. Almost certainly, created original raising Hogwarts. It good errors starting pop up. Chances one except Dumbledore could fix broken.  And Weasley twins turn Map Dumbledore. It would unforgivable insult Marauders - four unknowns who'd managed steal part Hogwarts security system, something probably forged Salazar Slytherin himself, twist tool student pranking.  Some might considered disrespectful.  Some might considered criminal.  The Weasley twins firmly believed Godric Gryffindor around see it, would approved.  The brothers walked on on, mostly silence. The Weasley twins talked thinking new pranks, one knew something didn't. Otherwise much point. If already knew information, tended think thoughts make decisions.  (Back old days, whenever magical identical twins born, custom kill one birth.)  In time, Fred George clambered dusty cellar, strewn barrels racks strange ingredients.  Fred George waited. It polite anything else.  Before long thin old man black pajamas clambered steps led cellar, yawning. "Hello, boys," said Ambrosius Flume. "I expecting tonight. Out stock already?"  Fred George decided Fred would speak.  "Not exactly, Mr. Flume," said Fred. "We hoping could help us something considerably more... interesting."  "Now, boys," said Flume, sounding severe, "I hope wake I could tell I'm selling merchandise could get real trouble. Not sixteen, anyways -"  George drew forth item robes, wordlessly passed Flume. "Have seen this?" said Fred.  Flume looked yesterday's edition Daily Prophet nodded, scowling. The headline paper read THE NEXT DARK LORD? showed young boy student's camera managed catch uncharacteristically cold grim expression.  "I can't believe Malfoy," Flume snapped. "Going boy he's eleven! The man ought ground used make chocolates!"  Fred George blinked unison. Malfoy behind Rita Skeeter? Harry Potter warned that... surely meant Harry know. He never would brought did...  Fred George exchanged glances. Well, Harry need know job done.  "Mr. Flume," Fred said quietly, "the Boy-Who-Lived needs help."  Flume looked both.  Then let breath sigh.  "All right," said Flume, "what want?"   Act 6:  When Rita Skeeter intent tasty prey, tend notice scurrying ants constituted rest universe, almost bumped balding young man who'd stepped pathway.  "Miss Skeeter," said man, sounding rather severe cold someone whose face looked young. "Fancy running here."  "Out way, buster!" snapped Rita, tried step around him.  The man pathway matched movement perfectly like neither moved all, stood still street shifted around them.  Rita's eyes narrowed. "Who think are?"  "How foolish," man said dryly. "It would wise memorize face disguised Death Eater training Harry Potter next Dark Lord. After all," thin smile, "that certainly sounds like someone want run street, especially hatchet job newspaper."  Rita took moment place reference. This Quirinus Quirrell? He looked young old time; face, relaxed severe condescending pose, would belong someone late thirties. And hair already falling out? Couldn't afford healer?  No, important, time place beetle be. She'd received anonymous tip Madam Bones making time one younger assistants. That would worth quite bonus could manage verify it, Bones high hit list. The tipster said Bones young assistant due eat lunch special room Mary's Place, popular room certain purposes; room which, she'd found, secure listening devices, proof beautiful blue beetle nestled one wall...  "Out way!" Rita said, tried push Quirrell path. Quirrell's arm brushed own, deflecting, Rita staggered thrust went thin air.  Quirrell pulled sleeve left robe, showing left arm. "Observe," said Quirrell, "no Dark Mark. I would like paper publish retraction."  Rita let incredulous laugh. Of course man real Death Eater. The paper published was. "Forget it, buster. Now take hike."  Quirrell stared moment.  Then smiled.  "Miss Skeeter," said Quirrell, "I hoped find lever would prove persuasive. Yet I find I cannot deny pleasure simply crushing you."  "It's tried. Now get way, buster, I'll find Aurors arrested obstruction journalism."  Quirrell swept small bow, walked past. "Goodbye, Rita Skeeter," said voice behind her.  As Rita bulled ahead, noted back mind man whistling tune walked away.  Like would scare her.   Act 4:  "Sorry, count out," said Lee Jordan. "I'm giant spider type."  The Boy-Who-Lived said important work Order Chaos, something serious secret, significant difficult usual run pranks.  And Harry Potter launched speech inspiring, yet vague. A speech effect Fred George Lee tremendous potential could learn weirder. To make people's lives surreal, instead surprising equivalents buckets water propped doors. (Fred George exchanged interested looks, they'd never thought one.) Harry Potter invoked picture prank they'd pulled Neville - which, Harry mentioned remorse, Sorting Hat chewed - must made Neville doubt sanity. For Neville would felt like suddenly transported alternate universe. The way everyone else felt they'd seen Snape apologize. That true power pranking.  Are me? Harry Potter cried, Lee Jordan answered no.  "Count us in," said Fred, possibly George, doubt Godric Gryffindor would said yes.  Lee Jordan gave regretful grin, stood up, left deserted Quieted corridor four members Order Chaos met sat conspiratorial circle.  The three members Order Chaos got business.  (It sad. Fred George would still work Lee giant spider pranks, ever. They'd started calling Order Chaos order recruit Harry Potter, Ron told Harry weird evil, Fred George decided save Harry showing true friendship kindness. Thankfully longer seemed necessary - although quite sure that...)  "So," said one twins, "what's about?"  "Rita Skeeter," said Harry. "Do know is?"  Fred George nodded, frowning.  "She's asking questions me."  That good news.  "Can guess I want do?"  Fred George looked other, bit puzzled. "You want us slip interesting candies?"  "No," said Harry. "No, no, no! That's giant-spider thinking! Come on, would heard Rita Skeeter looking rumors you?"  That made obvious.  Grins slowly started faces Fred George.  "Start rumors ourselves," replied.  "Exactly," said Harry, grinning widely. "But can't rumors. I want teach people never believe newspaper says Harry Potter, Muggles believe newspaper says Elvis. At first I thought flooding Rita Skeeter many rumors know believe, she'll cherry-pick ones sound plausible bad. So I want create fake story me, get Rita Skeeter believe somehow. But something that, afterward, everyone know fake. We want fool Rita Skeeter editors, afterward proof come false. And course - given requirements - story ridiculous possibly be, still get printed. Do understand I want do?"  "Not exactly..." Fred George said slowly. "You want us invent story?"  "I want it," Harry Potter said. "I'm sort busy right now, plus I want able say truthfully I idea coming. Surprise me."  For moment evil grin faces Fred George.  Then turned serious. "But Harry, really know anything like -"  "So figure out," Harry said. "I confidence you. Not total confidence, can't it, tell that, I'll try someone else, myself. If really good idea - ridiculous story, convince Rita Skeeter editors print - go ahead it. But go something mediocre. If can't come something awesome, say so."  Fred George exchanged worried glances.  "I can't think anything," said George.  "Neither I," said Fred. "Sorry."  Harry stared them.  And Harry began explain went thinking things.  It known take longer two seconds, said Harry.  You never called question impossible, said Harry, taken actual clock thought five minutes, motion minute hand. Not five minutes metaphorically, five minutes physical clock.  And furthermore, Harry said, voice emphatic right hand thumping hard floor, start immediately looking solutions.  Harry launched explanation test done someone named Norman Maier, something called organizational psychologist, who'd asked two different sets problem-solving groups tackle problem.  The problem, Harry said, involved three employees three jobs. The junior employee wanted easiest job. The senior employee wanted rotate jobs, avoid boredom. An efficiency expert recommended giving junior person easiest job senior person hardest job, would 20% productive.  One set problem-solving groups given instruction "Do propose solutions problem discussed thoroughly possible without suggesting any."  The set problem-solving groups given instructions. And people done natural thing, reacted presence problem proposing solutions. And people gotten attached solutions, started fighting them, arguing relative importance freedom versus efficiency on.  The first set problem-solving groups, ones given instructions discuss problem first solve it, far likely hit upon solution letting junior employee keep easiest job rotating two people two jobs, expert's data said would 19% improvement.  Starting looking solutions taking things entirely order. Like starting meal dessert, bad.  (Harry also quoted someone named Robyn Dawes saying harder problem was, likely people try solve immediately.)  So Harry going leave problem Fred George, would discuss aspects brainstorm anything thought might remotely relevant. And try come actual solution they'd finished that, unless course happen randomly think something awesome, case could write afterward go back thinking. And want hear back so-called failures think anything least week. Some people spent decades trying think things.  "Any questions?" said Harry.  Fred George stared other.  "I can't think any."  "Neither I."  Harry coughed gently. "You ask budget."  Budget? thought.  "I could tell amount," Harry said. "But I think inspiring."  Harry's hands dipped robe, brought forth -  Fred George almost fell over, even though sitting down.  "Don't spend sake spending it," Harry said. On stone floor front gleamed absolutely ridiculous amount money. "Only spend awesomeness requires; awesomeness require, hesitate spend. If there's anything left over, return afterward, I trust you. Oh, get ten percent what's there, regardless much end spending -"  "We can't!" blurted one twins. "We accept money sort thing!"  (The twins never took money anything illegal. Unknown Ambrosius Flume, selling merchandise zero percent markup. Fred George wanted able testify - Veritaserum necessary - profiteering criminals, providing public service.)  Harry frowned them. "But I'm asking put real work here. A grownup would get paid something like this, would still count favor friend. You can't hire people sort thing."  Fred George shook heads.  "Fine," Harry said. "I'll get expensive Christmas presents, try returning I'll burn them. Now even know much I'm going spend you, except, obviously, going taken money. And I'm going buy presents anyway, think tell can't think anything awesome."  Harry stood up, smiling, turned go Fred George still gaping shock. He strode steps away, turned back.  "Oh, one last thing," Harry said. "Leave Professor Quirrell whatever do. He like publicity. I know it'd easier get people believe weird things Defense Professor anyone else, I'm sorry to get way like that, please, leave Professor Quirrell it."  And Harry turned took steps -  Looked back one last time, said, softly, "Thank you."  And left.  There long pause he'd departed.  "So," said one.  "So," said other.  "The Defense Professor like publicity, he."  "Harry know us well, he."  "No, doesn't."  "But use money that, course."  "Of course not, right. We'll Defense Professor separately."  "We'll get Gryffindors write Skeeter, say..."  "...his sleeve lifted one time Defense class, saw Dark Mark..."  "...and he's probably teaching Harry Potter sorts dreadful things..."  "...and he's worst Defense Professor anyone remembers even Hogwarts, he's failing teach us, he's getting everything wrong, complete opposite be..."  "...like claimed could cast Killing Curse using love, made pretty much useless."  "I like one."  "Thanks."  "I bet Defense Professor likes too."  "He sense humor. He called us sense humor."  "But really going able Harry's job?"  "Harry said discuss problem trying solve it, let's that."  The Weasley twins decided George would enthusiastic one Fred doubted.  "It seems sort contradictory," said Fred. "He wants ridiculous enough everyone laughs Skeeter knows wrong, wants Skeeter believe it. We can't things time."  "We'll fake evidence convince Skeeter," said George.  "Was solution?" said Fred.  They considered this.  "Maybe," said George, "but I think strict it, you?"  The twins shrugged helplessly.  "So fake evidence good enough convince Skeeter," said Fred. "Can really own?"  "We own," said George, pointed pile money. "We hire people help us."  The twins got thoughtful look face.  "That could use Harry's budget pretty fast," said Fred. "This lot money us, lot money someone like Flume."  "Maybe people give discounts know Harry," said George. "But importantly all, whatever do, impossible."  Fred blinked. "What mean, impossible?"  "So impossible get trouble, one believes could done it. So impossible even Harry starts wondering. It surreal, make people doubt sanity, be... better Harry."  Fred's eyes wide astonishment. This happened sometimes, them, often. "But why?"  "They pranks. They pranks. The pie prank. The Remembrall prank. Kevin Entwhistle's cat prank. Snape prank. We're best pranksters Hogwarts, going roll give without fight?"  "He's Boy-Who-Lived," said Fred.  "And we're Weasley twins! He's challenging us. He said could does. But I bet think we'll ever good him."  "He's right," said Fred, feeling rather nervous. The Weasley twins sometimes disagree even information, every time seemed unnatural, like least one must something wrong. "This Harry Potter we're talking about. He impossible. We can't."  "Yes can," said George. "And impossible him."  "But -" said Fred.  "It's Godric Gryffindor would do," said George.  That settled it, twins snapped back into... whatever was normal them.  "All right, -"  "- let's think it."   Chapter 26: Noticing Confusion  Yakka foob mog. Grug pubbawup zink wattoom gazork. Chumble spuzz J. K. Rowling.   Professor Quirrell's office hours consisted 11:40 11:55 AM Thursday. That students years. It cost Quirrell point knock door, think reason worth time, would lose another fifty.  Harry knocked door.  There pause. Then biting voice said, "I suppose may well come in, Mr. Potter."  And Harry could touch doorknob, door slammed open, hitting wall sharp crack sounded like something might broken wood, stone, both.  Professor Quirrell leaning back chair reading suspiciously old-looking book, bound night-blue leather silver runes spine. His eyes moved pages. "I good mood, Mr. Potter. And I good mood, I pleasant person around. For sake, conduct business quickly depart."  A cold chill seeped room, though contained something cast darkness way lamps cast light, fully shaded.  Harry bit taken aback. Not good mood quite seem cover it. What could bothering Professor Quirrell much...?  Well, walk friends feeling down. Harry cautiously advanced room. "Is anything I help -"  "No," said Professor Quirrell, still looking book.  "I mean, dealing idiots want someone sane talk to..."  There surprisingly long pause.  Professor Quirrell slammed book shut vanished small whispering sound. He looked up, then, Harry flinched.  "I suppose intelligent conversation would pleasant point," said Professor Quirrell biting tone invited Harry enter. "You likely find so, warned."  Harry drew deep breath. "I promise I mind snap me. What happened?"  The cold room seemed deepen. "A sixth-year Gryffindor cast curse one promising students, sixth-year Slytherin."  Harry swallowed. "What... sort curse?"  And fury Professor Quirrell's face longer contained. "Why bother ask unimportant question like that, Mr. Potter? Our friend sixth-year Gryffindor think important!"  "Are serious?" Harry said could stop himself.  "No, I'm terrible mood today particular reason. Yes I'm serious, fool! He know. He actually know. I believe Aurors confirmed Veritaserum. He sixth year Hogwarts cast high-level Dark curse without knowing did."  "You mean," Harry said, "that mistaken did, somehow read wrong spell description -"  "All knew was meant directed enemy. He knew knew."  And enough cast spell. "I understand anything small brain could walk upright."  "Indeed, Mr. Potter," said Professor Quirrell.  There pause. Professor Quirrell leaned forward picked silver inkwell desk, turning around hands, staring though wondering could go torturing inkwell death.  "Was sixth-year Slytherin seriously hurt?" said Harry.  "Yes."  "Was sixth-year Gryffindor raised Muggles?"  "Yes."  "Is Dumbledore refusing expel poor boy know?"  Professor Quirrell's hands whitened inkwell. "Do point, Mr. Potter, stating obvious?"  "Professor Quirrell," said Harry gravely, "all Muggle-raised students Hogwarts need safety lecture told things ridiculously obvious wizardborn would ever think mention them. Don't cast curses know do, discover something dangerous tell world it, brew high-level potions without supervision bathroom, reason underage magic laws, basics."  "Why?" said Professor Quirrell. "Let stupid ones die breed."  "If mind losing sixth-year Slytherins along them."  The inkwell caught fire Professor Quirrell's hands burned terrible slowness, hideous black-orange flames tearing metal seeming take tiny bites it, silver twisting melted, though trying failing escape. There tinny shrieking sound, though metal screaming.  "I suppose right," Professor Quirrell said resigned smile. "I shall design lecture ensure Muggleborns stupid live take anyone valuable depart."  The inkwell went screaming burning Professor Quirrell's hands, tiny droplets metal, still fire, dripping desk, though inkwell crying.  "You're running away," observed Professor Quirrell.  Harry opened mouth -  "If say scared me," said Professor Quirrell, "don't."  "You scariest person I know," Harry said, "and one top reasons control. I simply can't imagine hearing hurt someone made deliberate decision hurt."  The fire Professor Quirrell's hands winked out, carefully placed ruined inkwell desk. "You say nicest things, Mr. Potter. Have taking lessons flattery? From, perhaps, Mr. Malfoy?"  Harry kept expression blank, realized one second late might well signed confession. Professor Quirrell care expression looked like, cared states mind made likely.  "I see," said Professor Quirrell. "Mr. Malfoy useful friend have, Mr. Potter, much teach you, I hope made mistake trusting many confidences."  "He knows nothing I fear becoming known," said Harry.  "Well done," said Professor Quirrell, smiling slightly. "So original business here?"  "I think I'm done preliminary exercises Occlumency ready tutor."  Professor Quirrell nodded. "I shall conduct Gringotts Sunday." He paused, looking Harry, smiled. "And might even make little outing, like. I've pleasant thought."  Harry nodded, smiling back.  As Harry left office, heard Professor Quirrell humming small tune.  Harry glad he'd been able cheer up.   That Sunday seemed rather large number people whispering hallways, least Harry Potter walked past them.  And lot pointed fingers.  And great deal female giggling.  It started breakfast, someone asked Harry he'd heard news, Harry quickly interrupted said news written Rita Skeeter want hear it, wanted read paper himself.  It developed many students Hogwarts got copies Daily Prophet, copies already bought owners passed around sort complicated order nobody really knew one moment...  So Harry used Quieting Charm gone eat breakfast, trusting seat-mates wave many, many questioners, best ignore incredulity, laughter, congratulatory smiles, pitying looks, fearful glances, dropped plates new people came breakfast heard.  Harry feeling rather curious, really done spoil artistry hearing secondhand.  He'd done homework safety trunk next couple hours, telling dormmates come get anyone found original newspaper.  Harry still ignorant 10AM, he'd left Hogwarts carriage Professor Quirrell, front right, currently slumped zombie-mode. Harry sitting diagonally across, far away carriage allowed, back left. Even so, Harry constant feeling doom carriage rattled small path section non-forbidden forest. It made bit hard read, especially since material difficult, Harry suddenly wished reading one childhood science fiction books instead -  "We're outside wards, Mr. Potter," said Professor Quirrell's voice front. "Time go."  Professor Quirrell carefully disembarked carriage, bracing stepped down. Harry, side, jumped off.  Harry wondering exactly they'd get Professor Quirrell said "Catch!" threw bronze Knut him, Harry caught without thinking.  A giant intangible hook caught Harry's abdomen yanked back, hard, without sense acceleration, instant later Harry standing middle Diagon Alley.  (Excuse me, what? said brain.)  (We teleported, explained Harry.)  (That used happen ancestral environment, Harry's brain complained, disoriented him.)  Harry staggered feet adjusted brick street instead dirt forest corridor traversing. He straightened, still dizzy, bustling witches wizards seeming sway slightly, cries shopkeepers seeming move around hearing, brain tried place world located in.  Moments later, sort sucking-popping sound paces behind Harry, Harry turned look Professor Quirrell there.  "Do mind -" said Harry, time Professor Quirrell said, "I'm afraid I -"  Harry stopped, Professor Quirrell didn't.  "- need go set something motion, Mr. Potter. As thoroughly explained I responsible anything whatsoever happens you, I'll leaving -"  "Newsstand," Harry said.  "Pardon?"  "Or anywhere I buy copy Daily Prophet. Put I'll happy."  Shortly after, Harry delivered bookstore, accompanied several quietly spoken, ambiguous threats. And shopkeeper gotten less ambiguous threats, judging way cringed, eyes kept darting Harry entrance.  If bookstore burned down, Harry going stick around middle fire Professor Quirrell got back.  Meanwhile -  Harry took quick glance around.  The bookstore seemed rather small shoddy, four rows bookcases visible, nearest shelf Harry's eyes jumped seemed deal narrow, cheaply bound books grim titles like The Massacre Albania Fifteenth Century.  First things first. Harry stepped seller's counter.  "Pardon me," said Harry, "One copy Daily Prophet, please."  "Five Sickles," said shopkeeper. "Sorry, kid, I've got three left."  Five Sickles dropped onto counter. Harry feeling could bargained couple points, point really care.  The shopkeeper's eyes widened seemed really notice Harry first time. "You!"  "Me!"  "Is true? Are really -"  "Shut up! Sorry, I've waiting day read original newspaper instead hearing secondhand, please hand over, right?"  The shopkeeper stared Harry moment, wordlessly reached counter passed one folded copy Daily Prophet.  The headline read:  HARRY POTTER   SECRETLY BETROTHED   TO GINEVRA WEASLEY  Harry stared.  He lifted newspaper counter, softly, reverently, like handling original Escher artwork, unbent read...  ...about evidence convinced Rita Skeeter.  ...and interesting details.  ...and yet evidence.  Fred George cleared sister first, surely? Yes, course had. There picture Ginevra Weasley sighing longingly Harry could see, looking closely, photo himself. That staged.  But Earth...?  Harry sitting cheap folding chair, rereading newspaper fourth time, door whispered softly Professor Quirrell came back shop.  "My apologies - Merlin's name reading?"  "It would seem," said Harry, awe voice, "that one Mr. Arthur Weasley placed Imperius Curse Death Eater father killed, thus creating debt Noble House Potter, father demanded repaid hand marriage recently born Ginevra Weasley. Do people actually sort thing around here?"  "How could Miss Skeeter possibly fool enough believe -"  And Professor Quirrell's voice cut off.  Harry reading newspaper held vertically unfolded, meant Professor Quirrell, standing, could see text underneath headline.  The look shock Professor Quirrell's face work art almost par newspaper itself.  "Don't worry," said Harry cheerfully, "it's fake."  From elsewhere store, heard shopkeeper gasp. There sound stack books falling over.  "Mr. Potter..." Professor Quirrell said slowly, "are sure that?"  "Quite sure. Shall go?"  Professor Quirrell nodded, looking rather abstracted, Harry folded newspaper back up, followed door.  For reason Harry seem hearing street noises now.  They walked silence thirty seconds Professor Quirrell spoke. "Miss Skeeter viewed original proceedings restricted Wizengamot session."  "Yes."  "The original proceedings Wizengamot."  "Yes."  "I would trouble that."  "Really?" said Harry. "Because suspicions correct, done Hogwarts student."  "That beyond impossible," Professor Quirrell said flatly. "Mr. Potter... I regret say young lady expects marry you."  "But improbable," said Harry. "To quote Douglas Adams, impossible often kind integrity merely improbable lacks."  "I see point," Professor Quirrell said slowly. "But... no, Mr. Potter. It may impossible, I imagine tampering Wizengamot proceedings. It unimaginable Grand Manager Gringotts affix seal office witness false betrothal contract, Miss Skeeter personally verified seal."  "Indeed," said Harry, "you would expect Grand Manager Gringotts get involved much money changing hands. It seems Mr. Weasley greatly debt, demanded additional payment ten thousand Galleons -"  "Ten thousand Galleons Weasley? You could buy daughter Noble House that!"  "Excuse me," Harry said. "I really ask point, people actually sort thing around -"  "Rarely," said Professor Quirrell, frown face. "And all, I suspect, since Dark Lord departed. I suppose according newspaper, father paid it?"  "He choice," said Harry. "Not wanted fulfill conditions prophecy."  "Give that," said Professor Quirrell, newspaper leaped Harry's hand fast got paper cut.  Harry automatically put finger mouth suck on, feeling rather shocked, turned remonstrate Professor Quirrell -  Professor Quirrell stopped short middle street, eyes flickering rapidly back forth invisible force held newspaper suspended him.  Harry watched, gaping open awe, newspaper opened reveal pages two three. And much long after, four five. It like man cast pretense mortality.  And troublingly short time, paper neatly folded again. Professor Quirrell plucked air tossed Harry, caught sheer reflex; Professor Quirrell started walking again, Harry automatically trudged after.  "No," said Professor Quirrell, "that prophecy sound quite right either."  Harry nodded, still stunned.  "The centaurs could put Imperius," Professor Quirrell said, frowning, "that seems understandable. What magic make, magic corrupt, unthinkable Great Seal Gringotts could twisted another's hand. The Unspeakable could impersonated Polyjuice, likewise Bavarian seer. And enough effort might possible tamper proceedings Wizengamot. Do idea done?"  "I one single plausible hypothesis," said Harry. "I know done total budget forty Galleons."  Professor Quirrell stopped short whirled Harry. His expression completely incredulous. "Forty Galleons pay competent ward-breaker open path home wish burglarize! Forty thousand Galleons might pay team greatest professional criminals world tamper proceedings Wizengamot!"  Harry shrugged helplessly. "I'll remember next time I want save thirty-nine thousand, nine hundred sixty Galleons finding right contractor."  "I say often," said Professor Quirrell. "I impressed."  "Likewise," said Harry.  "And incredible Hogwarts student?"  "I'm afraid I say."  Somewhat Harry's surprise, Professor Quirrell made objection this.  They walked direction Gringotts building, thinking, neither sort person would give problem without considering least five minutes.  "I feeling," Harry said finally, "that we're coming wrong angle. There's tale I heard students came physics class, teacher showed large metal plate near fire. She ordered feel metal plate, felt metal nearer fire cooler, metal away warmer. And said, write guess happens. So students wrote 'because metal conducts heat', students wrote 'because air moves', one said 'this seems impossible', real answer students came room, teacher turned plate around."  "Interesting," said Professor Quirrell. "That sound similar. Is moral?"  "That strength rationalist ability confused fiction reality," said Harry. "If equally good explaining outcome, zero knowledge. The students thought could use words like 'because heat conduction' explain anything, even metal plate cooler side nearer fire. So notice confused were, meant confused falsehood truth. If tell centaurs Imperius Curse, I still feeling something quite right. I notice I'm still confused even hearing explanation."  "Hm," said Professor Quirrell.  They walked further.  "I suppose," said Harry, "that possible actually swap people alternate universes? Like, Rita Skeeter, temporarily sent somewhere else?"  "If possible," Professor Quirrell said, voice rather dry, "would I still here?"  And almost huge white front Gringotts building, Professor Quirrell said:  "Ah. Of course. I see now. Let guess, Weasley twins?"  "What?" said Harry, voice going another octave pitch. "How?"  "I'm afraid I say."  "...That fair."  "I think extremely fair," said Professor Quirrell, entered bronze doors.   The time noon, Harry Professor Quirrell seated foot head wide, long, flat table, sumptuously appointed private room thoroughly cushioned couches chairs along walls, soft curtains hanging everywhere.  They eat lunch Mary's Place, Professor Quirrell said known one best restaurants Diagon Alley, especially - voice dropped meaningfully - certain purposes.  It nicest restaurant Harry ever in, really eating away Harry Professor Quirrell treating meal.  The first part mission, find Occlumency instructor, success. Professor Quirrell, smiling evilly, told Griphook recommend best knew, worry expense, since Dumbledore paying it; goblin smiled return. There might certain amount smiling Harry's part well.  The second part plan complete failure.  Harry allowed take money vault without Headmaster Dumbledore school official present, Professor Quirrell given vault key. Harry's Muggle parents could authorize Muggles, Muggles around legal standing children kittens: cute, tortured public could get arrested, people. Some reluctant provision made recognizing parents Muggleborns human limited sense, Harry's adoptive parents fall legal category.  It seemed Harry effectively orphan eyes wizarding world. As such, Headmaster Hogwarts, designees within school system, Harry's guardians graduated. Harry could breathe without Dumbledore's permission, long Headmaster specifically prohibit it.  Harry asked could simply tell Griphook diversify investments beyond stacks gold coins sitting vault.  Griphook stared blankly asked 'diversify' meant.  Banks, seemed, make investments. Banks stored gold coins secure vaults annual fee.  The wizarding world concept stock. Or equity. Or corporations. Businesses run families personal vaults.  Loans made rich people, banks. Though Gringotts would witness contract, fee, enforce collection, much larger fee.  Good rich people let friends borrow money pay back whenever. Bad rich people charged interest.  There secondary market loans.  Evil rich people charged annual interest rates least 20%.  Harry stood up, turned away, rested head wall.  Harry asked needed Headmaster's permission could start bank.  Professor Quirrell interrupted point, saying time lunch, swiftly conducted fuming Harry bronze doors Gringotts, Diagon Alley, fine restaurant called Mary's Place, room reserved them. The owner looked shocked seeing Professor Quirrell accompanied Harry Potter, conducted room without complaint.  And Professor Quirrell quite deliberately announced would pay bill, seeming rather enjoy look Harry's face.  "No," said Professor Quirrell waitress, "we require menus. I daily special accompanied bottle Chianti, Mr. Potter Diracawl soup start, followed plate Roopo balls, treacle pudding dessert."  The waitress, clad robes still looked severe formal rather shorter usual, bowed respectfully departed, shutting door behind her.  Professor Quirrell waved hand direction door, bolt slid shut. "Note bolt inside. This room, Mr. Potter, known Mary's Room. It happens proof scrying, I mean all; Dumbledore could detect nothing happens here. Mary's Room used two kinds people. The first sort engaged illicit dalliances. And second sort lead interesting lives."  "Really," said Harry.  Professor Quirrell nodded.  Harry's lips parted anticipation. "It would waste sit eat lunch, then, without anything special."  Professor Quirrell grinned, took wand flicked direction door. "Of course," said, "people lead interesting lives take precautions thorough dalliers. I sealed us in. Nothing pass room - crack door, example. And..."  Professor Quirrell spoke fewer four different Charms, none Harry recognized.  "Even really suffice," said Professor Quirrell. "If anything truly great import, would necessary perform another twenty-three checks besides those. If, say, Rita Skeeter knew guessed would come here, possible could room wearing true Cloak Invisibility. Or could Animagus tiny form, perhaps. There tests rule rare possibilities, perform would arduous. Still, I wonder I anyway, teach bad habits?" And Professor Quirrell tapped finger cheek, looking abstracted.  "It's fine," Harry said, "I understand, I'll remember." Though little disappointed anything truly great import.  "Very well," Professor Quirrell said. He leaned back chair, smiling broadly. "You wrought quite well today, Mr. Potter. The basic notion yours, I'm sure, even delegated execution. I think we'll hearing much Rita Skeeter this. Lucius Malfoy pleased failure. If smart, she'll flee country instant realizes fooled."  A sinking sensation began dawn Harry's stomach. "Lucius behind Rita Skeeter...?"  "Oh, realize that?" said Professor Quirrell.  Harry thought would happen Rita Skeeter afterward.  At all.  Not slightest.  But would get fired job, course would fired, might children going Hogwarts Harry knew, worse, much worse -  "Is Lucius going killed?" Harry said barely audible voice. Somewhere head, Sorting Hat screaming him.  Professor Quirrell smiled dryly. "If dealt journalists before, take world gets little brighter every time one dies."  Harry jumped chair convulsive movement, find Rita Skeeter warn late -  "Sit down," Professor Quirrell said sharply. "No, Lucius kill her. But Lucius makes life extremely unpleasant serve ill. Miss Skeeter flee start life new name. Sit down, Mr. Potter; nothing point, lesson learn."  Harry sat down, slowly. There disappointed, annoyed look Professor Quirrell's face stop words.  "There times," Professor Quirrell said, voice cutting, "when I worry brilliant Slytherin mind simply wasted you. Repeat me. Rita Skeeter vile, disgusting woman."  "Rita Skeeter vile, disgusting woman," Harry said. He comfortable saying it, seem possible actions, none all.  "Rita Skeeter tried destroy reputation, I executed ingenious plan destroyed reputation first."  "Rita Skeeter challenged me. She lost game, I won."  "Rita Skeeter obstacle future plans. I choice deal I wanted plans succeed."  "Rita Skeeter enemy."  "I cannot possibly get anything done life I willing defeat enemies."  "I defeated one enemies today."  "I good boy."  "I deserve special reward."  "Ah," said Professor Quirrell, grinning benevolent smile last lines, "I see I succeeded catching attention."  That true. And Harry felt like railroaded something - no, feeling, railroaded - deny saying things, seeing Professor Quirrell's smile, make feel better.  Professor Quirrell reached robes, gesture slow deliberately significant, drew forth...  ...a book.  It different book Harry ever seen, edges corners visibly misshapen; rough-hewn phrase came mind, like hacked book mine.  "What it?" breathed Harry.  "A diary," said Professor Quirrell.  "Whose?"  "That famous person." Professor Quirrell smiling broadly.  "Okay..."  Professor Quirrell's expression became serious. "Mr. Potter, one requisites becoming powerful wizard excellent memory. The key puzzle often something read twenty years ago old scroll, peculiar ring saw finger man met once. I mention explain I managed remember item, placard attached it, meeting good deal later. You see, Mr. Potter, course life, I viewed number private collections held individuals are, perhaps, quite deserving -"  "You stole it?" Harry said incredulously.  "That correct," said Professor Quirrell. "Very recently, fact. I think appreciate particular item much vile little man held purpose impressing equally vile friends rarity."  Harry simply gaping now.  "But feel actions incorrect, Mr. Potter, I suppose accept special present. Though course I go trouble stealing back. So be?"  Professor Quirrell tossed book one hand another, causing Harry reach involuntarily look dismay.  "Oh," said Professor Quirrell, "don't worry little rough handling. You could toss diary fireplace would emerge unscathed. In case, I await decision."  Professor Quirrell casually threw book air caught again, grinning.  No, said Gryffindor Hufflepuff.  Yes, said Ravenclaw. What part word 'book' two understand?  The theft part, said Hufflepuff.  Oh, come on, said Ravenclaw, can't seriously ask us say spend rest life wondering was.  It sounds like net positive utilitarian standpoint, said Slytherin. Think economic transaction generates gains trade, without trade part. Plus, steal help anyone Professor Quirrell keep it.  He's trying turn Dark! shrieked Gryffindor, Hufflepuff nodded firmly.  Don't naive little boy, said Slytherin, he's trying teach Slytherin.  Yeah, said Ravenclaw. Whoever owned book originally probably Death Eater something. It belongs us.     Harry's mouth opened, halted way, agonized look face.  Professor Quirrell seemed quite enjoying himself. He balanced book corner, one finger, keeping upright humming little tune.  There came knock door.  The book vanished back Professor Quirrell's robes, rose chair. Professor Quirrell started walk door -  - staggered, suddenly lurching wall.  "It's right," said Professor Quirrell's voice, suddenly sounded lot weaker usual. "Sit down, Mr. Potter, dizzy spell. Sit down."  Harry's fingers gripped edge chair, uncertain do, could do. Harry even get close Professor Quirrell, unless wanted defy sense Doom -  Professor Quirrell straightened, then, breathing seeming bit heavy, opened door.  The waitress came in, bearing platter food; distributed plates, Professor Quirrell walked slowly back table.  But time waitress bowed way out, Professor Quirrell sitting upright smiling again.  Still, brief episode whatever-it-was decided Harry. He say no, Professor Quirrell gone much trouble.  "Yes," Harry said.  Professor Quirrell held cautioning finger, took wand again, locked door again, repeated three Charms earlier.  Then Professor Quirrell took book back robes tossed Harry, almost dropped soup.  Harry shot Professor Quirrell look helpless indignation. You supposed books, enchanted not.  Harry opened book ingrained, instinctive care. The pages seemed thick, texture unlike either Muggle paper wizarding parchment. And contents were...  ...blank?  "Am I supposed seeing -"  "Look nearer beginning," said Professor Quirrell, Harry (again helpless, ingrained care) turned block pages back.  The lettering obviously handwritten, hard read, Harry thought words might Latin.  "What this?" said Harry.  "That," said Professor Quirrell, "is record magical researches Muggleborn never came Hogwarts. He refused letter, conducted small investigations, never get far without wand. From description placard, I expect name bears rather significance me. That, Harry Potter, diary Roger Bacon."  Harry almost fainted.  Nestled wall, Professor Quirrell stumbled, glistened crushed remains beautiful blue beetle.   Chapter 27: Empathy  J. K. Rowling 87% confident burst flames.  Roger Bacon lived 13th century credited one earliest advocates scientific method. Giving scientist experimental diary sort like giving writer pen, Shakespeare, someone helped invent writing.   It every day got see Harry Potter beg.  "Pleeaaase," whined Harry Potter.  Fred George shook heads again, smiling.  There agonized look Harry Potter's face. "But I told I one Kevin Entwhistle's cat, Hermione vanishing soda, I can't tell Sorting Hat Remembrall Professor Snape..."  Fred George shrugged turned leave.  "If ever figure out," said Weasley twins, "be sure let us know."  "You're evil! You're evil!"  Fred George firmly closed door empty classroom behind them, made sure keep grin faces while, case Harry Potter could see doors.  Then turned corner faces sagged.  "I suppose Harry's guesses -"  "- gave ideas?" said time, shoulders slumped further.  Their last relevant memory Flume refusing help them, though remember they'd asked do...  ...but must looked elsewhere found someone help something illegal, agreed Obliviated afterward.  How possibly able get done forty Galleons?  At first they'd worried they'd forged evidence good Harry actually would end married Ginny... they'd thought too, seemed. The Wizengamot proceedings tampered put back way they'd originally, fake betrothal contract vanished dragon-guarded vault Gringotts, on. It pretty scary, actually. Most people thought Daily Prophet made whole thing unguessable reasons, Quibbler helpfully twisted knife deeper next day's headline, HARRY POTTER SECRETLY BETROTHED TO LUNA LOVEGOOD.  Whoever they'd hired would tell statute limitations expired, desperately hoped. But meanwhile awful, they'd pulled greatest prank ever, maybe greatest prank history pranking, remember how. It crazy, they'd able think way first time, see knowing everything they'd done?  Their consolation Harry know know.  Not even Mum questioned it, despite obvious Weasley connection. Whatever done, far reach Hogwarts student... except possibly one, who, certain rumors true, might done snapping fingers. Harry questioned Veritaserum, he'd told them... Dumbledore present giving Aurors scary looks. The Aurors asked enough determine Harry pulled prank disappeared anyone, gotten heck Hogwarts.  Fred George wondered whether feel insulted Harry Potter questioned Aurors prank, look Harry's face, probably exactly reason, made everything worth it.  Unsurprisingly, Rita Skeeter editor Daily Prophet vanished probably another country now. They would've liked able tell family part. Dad would congratulated them, thought, Mum finished killing Ginny burned remains.  But everything still right, they'd tell Dad someday, meanwhile...  ...meanwhile Dumbledore happened sneeze passing hallway, small package accidentally dropped pockets, inside two matched wardbreaker's monocles incredible quality. The Weasley twins tested new monocles "forbidden" third-floor corridor, making quick trip magic mirror back, able see detection webs clearly, monocles shown lot they'd seen first time.  Of course would careful never get caught monocles possession, would end Headmaster's office getting stern lecture maybe even threats expulsion.  It good know everyone got Sorted Gryffindor grew Professor McGonagall.   Harry white room, windowless, featureless, sitting desk, facing expressionless man formal robes solid black.  The room screened detection, man performed exactly twenty-seven spells saying much "Hello, Mr. Potter."  It oddly appropriate man black try reading Harry's mind.  "Prepare yourself," man said tonelessly.  A human mind, Harry's Occlumency book said, exposed Legilimens along certain surfaces. If failed defend surfaces, Legilimens would go able access part mind able comprehend...  ...which tended much. Human minds, seemed, hard humans understand level shallowest. Harry wondered knowing lots cognitive science could make incredibly powerful Legilimens, repeated experience finally driven lesson needed get little less excited anticipations sort thing. It cognitive scientist understood humans well enough make one.  To learn counter, Occlumency, first step imagine different person, pretending thoroughly could, immersing entirely alternate persona. You always that, beginning, learned surfaces were. The Legilimens would try read you, would feel happening paid close enough attention, would sense trying enter. And job make sure always touched imaginary persona real one.  When good enough that, could imagine simple sort person, pretend rock, make habit leaving pretense place surfaces were. That standard Occlumency barrier. Pretending rock hard learn, easy afterward, exposed surface mind much shallower interior, enough practice could keep background habit.  Or perfect Occlumens, could race ahead probes, answering queries fast asked, Legilimens would enter surfaces see mind indistinguishable whoever pretending be.  Even best Legilimens could fooled way. If perfect Occlumens claimed dropping Occlumency barriers, way know lying. Worse, might know dealing perfect Occlumens. They rare, fact existed meant trust Legilimency anyone.  It sad commentary little human beings understood other, little wizard comprehended depths lying beneath mind's surface, could fool best human telepaths pretending someone else.  But human beings understood first place pretending. You make predictions people modeling hundred trillion synapses brain separate objects. Ask best social manipulator Earth build Artificial Intelligence scratch, they'd give dumb look. You predicted people telling brain act like theirs. You put place. If wanted know angry person would do, activated brain's anger circuitry, whatever circuitry output, prediction. What neural circuitry anger actually look like inside? Who knew? The best social manipulator Earth might know neurons were, neither might best Legilimens.  Anything Legilimens could understand, Occlumens could pretend be. It trick either way - probably implemented neural circuitry cases, single set control circuits reconfiguring brain act model someone else's.  And race telepathic offense telepathic defense decisive win defense. Otherwise entire magical world, maybe even whole Earth, would different place...  Harry took deep breath, concentrated. There slight smile face.  For once, once, Harry gotten shortchanged mysterious powers department.  After almost month work, whim real hunch, Harry decided make coldly angry try book's Occlumency exercises again. At point he'd mostly given hope sort thing, still seemed worth quick try -  He'd run book's hardest exercises two hours, next day he'd gone told Professor Quirrell ready.  His dark side, turned out, very, good pretending people.  Harry thought standard trigger, first time he'd gone entirely dark side...  Severus paused, looking quite pleased himself. "And be... five points? No, let us make even ten points Ravenclaw backchat."  Harry's smile grew chillier, regarded black-robed man thought going read Harry's mind.  And Harry turned someone else entirely, someone seemed appropriate occasion.  ...in white room, windowless, featureless, sitting desk, facing expressionless man formal robes solid black.  Kimball Kinnison regarded black-robed man thought going read mind Second-Stage Lensman Galactic Patrol.  To say Kimball Kinnison confident outcome would understatement. He trained Mentor Arisia, powerful mind known universe, mere wizard sitting across would see precisely Gray Lensman wanted see...  ...the mind boy currently disguised as, innocent child named Harry Potter.  "I'm ready," said Kimball Kinnison nervous tones exactly appropriate eleven-year-old boy.  "Legilimens," said black-robed wizard.  There pause.  The black-robed wizard blinked, he'd seen something shocking enough make even eyelids move. His voice quite toneless said, "The Boy-Who-Lived mysterious dark side?"  The heat slowly crept Harry's cheeks.  "Well," man said. His face settled back perfect calm. "Excuse me. Mr. Potter, good know advantages, wildly overconfident them. You may indeed able learn Occlumency eleven years age. This astounds me. I thought Mr. Dumbledore pretending insane again. Your dissociative talent strong I surprised find signs childhood abuse, may become perfect Occlumens time. But considerable difference expecting put successful Occlumency barrier first attempt. That merely ridiculous. Did feel anything I read mind?"  Harry shook head, blushing furiously.  "Then pay closer attention next time. The goal create perfect image first day lessons. The goal learn surfaces are. Prepare yourself."  Harry tried pretend Kimball Kinnison again, tried pay attention, thoughts little scattered suddenly aware things thinking about...  Oh, going suck.  Harry gritted teeth. At least instructor would Obliviated afterward.  "Legilimens."  There pause -   ...in white room, windowless, featureless, sitting desk, facing expressionless man formal robes solid black.  It fourth day, Sunday evening. When paid much, got sessions darned time wanted, never mind concept weekends.  "Hello, Mr. Potter," telepath said tonelessly, cast full suite privacy spells.  "Hello, Mr. Bester," Harry said wearily. "Let's get initial shock way, shall we?"  "You managed surprise me?" man said, sounding slightly interested. "Well then." He pointed wand stared Harry's eyes. "Legilimens."  There pause, black-robed wizard jerked someone touched cattle prod.  "The Dark Lord alive?" choked. His eyes suddenly wild. "Dumbledore turns invisible sneaks girls' dorm rooms?"  Harry sighed looked watch. In another three seconds...  "So," man said. He quite recovered tonelessness. "You genuinely believe going discover secret rules magic become all-powerful."  "That's right," Harry said evenly, still looking watch. "I'm overconfident."  "I wonder. It seems Sorting Hat thinks next Dark Lord."  "And know I'm trying pretty hard be, saw already long discussion whether willing teach Occlumency, end decided it, get with?"  "All right," said man exactly six seconds later, last time. "Prepare yourself." He paused, said, voice rather wistful, "Though I wish I could remember trick gold silver."  Harry finding disturbed reproducible human thoughts reset people back initial conditions exposed stimuli. It dispelling illusions good reductionist supposed first place.   Harry rather bad mood stomped Herbology class next Monday morning.  Hermione seething alongside him.  The children still inside, bit slow assemble things gibbering excitedly Ravenclaw winning year's second Quidditch match.  It seemed last night dinner, girl flown around broomstick thirty minutes caught sort giant mosquito. There facts happened match, irrelevant.  Harry missed exciting sports event due Occlumency lesson, also life.  He avoided conversations Ravenclaw dorm, Quieting Charms magical trunks wonderful. He eaten breakfast Gryffindor table.  But Harry avoid Herbology, Ravenclaws talked class, class, class, Harry looked baby furcot whose diaper changing, announced loudly trying learn plants Snitches grow anything could please shut Quidditch. Everyone else present given shocked looks, except Hermione, who'd looked like wanted applaud, Professor Sprout, awarded point Ravenclaw.  A point Ravenclaw.  One point.  The seven idiots idiot brooms playing idiot game earned one hundred ninety points Ravenclaw.  It seemed Quidditch scores added directly onto House points total.  In words, catching golden mosquito worth 150 House points.  Harry even imagine would to earn one hundred fifty House points.  Besides, y'know, rescuing hundred fifty Hufflepuffs, coming fifteen ideas good putting protective shells time machines, inventing one thousand five hundred creative ways kill people, Hermione Granger entire year.  "We kill them," Harry said Hermione, walking beside equally offended air.  "Who?" said Hermione. "The Quidditch team?"  "I thinking everyone involved way Quidditch anywhere, Ravenclaw team would start, yes."  Hermione's lips pursed disapprovingly. "You know killing people wrong, Harry?"  "Yes," Harry said.  "Okay, checking," Hermione said. "Let's get Seeker first. I've read Agatha Christie mysteries, know get onto train?"  "Two students plotting murder," said dry voice. "How shocking."  From around nearby corner strolled man lightly spotted robes, greasy hair falling long unkempt shoulders. Deadly danger seemed radiate him, filling hallway improperly mixed potions accidental falls people dying bed Aurors would rule natural causes.  Without thinking all, Harry stepped front Hermione.  There intake breath behind him, moment later Hermione brushed past stepped front him. "Run, Harry!" said. "Boys danger."  Severus Snape smiled mirthlessly. "Amusing. I request moment time, Potter, tear away flirtations Miss Granger."  Suddenly worried look Hermione's face. She turned Harry opened mouth, paused, looking distressed.  "Oh, worry, Miss Granger," said Severus's silky voice. "I promise return beau unmaimed." His smile vanished. "Now Potter I go private conversation, ourselves. I hope clear invited, case, consider order Hogwarts professor. I'm sure good little girl like disobey."  And Severus turned walked back around corner. "Coming, Potter?" voice said.  "Um," Harry said Hermione. "Can I sort go follow let work I say make sure worried offended?"  "No," Hermione said, voice trembling.  Severus's laughter echoed around corner.  Harry bowed head. "Sorry," said lowly, "really," went Potions Master.   "So," Harry said. There sounds two pairs legs, long short, padding across random stone corridor. The Potions Master striding quickly fast Harry keep up, insofar Harry could apply concept directionality Hogwarts, moving away frequented areas. "What's about?"  "I suppose could explain," Severus said dryly, "why two plotting murder Cho Chang?"  "I suppose could explain," Harry said dryly, "in capacity official Hogwarts school system, catching golden mosquito deemed academic accomplishment worthy hundred fifty House points?"  A smile crossed Severus's lips. "Dear me, I thought supposed perceptive. Are truly incapable understanding classmates, Potter, dislike much try? If Quidditch scores count toward House Cup none would care House points all. It would merely obscure contest students like Miss Granger."  It shockingly good answer.  And shock brought Harry's mind fully awake.  In retrospect surprising Severus understood students, understood well indeed.  He reading minds.  And...  ...the book said successful Legilimens extremely rare, rarer perfect Occlumens, almost one enough mental discipline.  Mental discipline?  Harry collected stories man routinely lost temper class blew young children.  ...but man, Harry spoken Dark Lord still alive, responded instantly perfectly - reacting precisely way someone completely ignorant would react.  The man stalked Hogwarts air assassin, radiating danger...  ...which exactly real assassin do. Real assassins look like meek little accountants killed you.  He Head House proud aristocratic Slytherin, wore robe spotted stains bits potions ingredients, two minutes magic could removed.  Harry noticed confused.  And threat estimate Head House Slytherin shot astronomically.  Dumbledore seemed think Severus his, there'd nothing contradict that; Potions Master "scary abusive", promised. So, Harry reasoned earlier, Fellowship business. If Severus planning harm, surely come get Harry front Hermione, witness, could simply waited time Harry alone...  Harry quietly bit lip.  "I knew boy truly adored Quidditch," said Severus Snape. "He utter pillock. Just I would expect, two."  "What this?" Harry said slowly.  "Patience, Potter."  Severus turned head, glided assassin's bearing nearby opening corridor walls, smaller narrower hallway leading off.  Harry followed him, wondering would smarter simply run away.  They turned made another turn, came dead end, simple blank wall. If Hogwarts actually built, rather conjured summoned birthed whatever, Harry would sharp words architect paying people build hallways go anywhere.  "Quietus," said Severus, things well.  Harry leaned back, folded arms across chest, watched Severus's face.  "Looking eyes, Potter?" said Severus Snape. "Your Occlumency lessons cannot progressed far enough block Legilimency. But perhaps progressed far enough detect it. Since I cannot know otherwise, I risk trying." The man smiled thinly. "And hold Dumbledore, I think. Which little talk."  Harry's eyes widened involuntarily.  "To begin with," Severus said, eyes glittering, "I like promise speak conversations anyone. So far school concerned, discussing Potions homework. Whether believe unimportant. So far Dumbledore McGonagall concerned, I violating Draco Malfoy's confidences me, neither us think proper speak particulars."  Harry's brain tried calculate ramifications implications ran swap space.  "Well?" said Potions Master.  "All right," Harry said slowly. It hard see conversation unable tell anyone could constraining it, case also tell anyone contents. "I promise."  Severus watching Harry intently. "You said Headmaster's office would tolerate bullying abuse. And I wonder, Harry Potter. Just much resemble father?"  "Unless we're talking Michael Verres-Evans," Harry said, "the answer I know little James Potter."  Severus nodded, though himself. "There fifth-year Slytherin. A boy named Lesath Lestrange. He bullied Gryffindors. I am... constrained, ability deal situations. You could help him, perhaps. If wished. I asking favor, owe one. It simply opportunity will."  Harry stared Severus, thinking.  "Wondering trap?" said Severus, faint smile crossing lips. "It not. It test. Call curiosity part. But Lesath's troubles real, difficulties intervening."  That trouble people knowing good guy. Even knew knew, still ignore bait.  And father protected students bullies too... matter Harry knew Severus told him. It still made feel warm inside, proud, made impossible walk away.  "Fine," Harry said. "Tell Lesath. Why bullied?"  Severus's face lost faint smile. "You think reasons, Potter?"  "Perhaps not," Harry said quietly. "But thought occurred might pushed unimportant mudblood girl stairs."  "Lesath Lestrange," Severus said, voice cold, "is son Bellatrix Black, fanatic evil servant Dark Lord. Lesath acknowledged bastard Rabastan Lestrange. Shortly Dark Lord's death, Bellatrix Rabastan Rabastan's brother Rodolphus captured torturing Alice Frank Longbottom. All three Azkaban life. The Longbottoms driven insane repeated Cruciatus remain St. Mungo's incurable ward. Is good reason bully him, Potter?"  "It reason all," Harry said, still quietly. "And Lesath done wrong know?"  The faint smile crossed Severus's lips again. "He saint anyone else. But pushed mudblood girls stairs, I ever heard."  "Or saw mind," said Harry.  Severus's expression chill. "I invade privacy, Potter. I looked within Gryffindors, rather. He simply convenient target little satisfactions."  A cold wash anger ran Harry's spine, remind Severus might trustworthy source information.  "And think," Harry said, "that intervention Harry Potter, Boy-Who-Lived, might prove effective."  "Indeed," said Severus Snape, told Harry Gryffindors planning next little game.   There main hallway running middle Hogwarts's second floor north-south axis, near center hallway opening short corridor goes dozen paces back turning right angle, making L-shape, goes dozen paces ends bright, wide window, looking three stories upon light drizzle falling east grounds Hogwarts. Standing window hear nothing main hallway, one hallway would hear went window. If think anything odd this, Hogwarts long.  Four boys red-trimmed robes laughing, boy green-trimmed robes screaming grabbing frantically onto edges opened window hands, four boys make though push out. It's joke, course, besides, fall height kill wizard. All good fun. If think anything odd -  "What doing?" says sixth boy's voice.  The four boys red-trimmed robes spin around sudden starts, boy green-trimmed robes frantically pushes away window falls floor, face streaked tears.  "Oh," says handsome boys red-trimmed robes, sounding relieved, "it's you. Hey, Lessy, know is?"  There answer boy floor, who's trying get sniffling control, boy red-trimmed robes draws back leg kick -  "Stop it!" shouts sixth boy.  The boy red-trimmed robes wobbles aborts kick. "Um," says, "do know is?"  The sixth boy's breathing sounds strange. "Lesath Lestrange," says, breath coming short pants, "and anything parents, five years old."   Neville Longbottom stared four huge fifth-year bullies front him, trying hard control trembling.  He told Harry Potter no.  "Why defending him?" said handsome one, slowly, sounding puzzled first hints offense. "He's Slytherin. And Lestrange."  "He's boy lost parents," said Neville Longbottom. "I know is." He know words come from. It sounded cool, like something Harry Potter would say.  The trembling went on, though.  "Who think are?" said handsome one, starting sound angry.  I Neville, last scion Noble Most Ancient House Longbottom -  Neville say it.  "I think he's traitor," said one Gryffindors, sudden sinking sensation Neville's stomach.  He'd known it, he'd known it. Harry Potter wrong all. Bullies stop Neville Longbottom told stop.  The handsome one took step forward, three others followed.  "So that's you," Neville said, amazed steady voice was. "It matter Lesath Lestrange Neville Longbottom."  Lesath Lestrange let sudden gasp, lying floor.  "Evil evil," snarled boy who'd spoken before, "and friends evil, evil too."  The four took another step forward.  Lesath rose, wobbling, feet. His face gray, took steps forward, leaned wall, say anything. His eyes fixed turn hallway, way out.  "Friends," Neville said. Now voice going bit pitch. "Yes, I friends. One Boy-Who-Lived."  A couple Gryffindors looked suddenly worried. The handsome one flinch. "Harry Potter here," said, voice hard, "and was, I think he'd like see Longbottom defending Lestrange."  And Gryffindors took another long step forward, behind them, Lesath crept along wall, waiting chance.  Neville swallowed, raised right hand thumb forefinger pressed together.  He shut eyes, Harry Potter made promise peek.  If work, never trusting anyone again.  His voice came surprisingly clear, considering.  "Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres. Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres. Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres. By debt owe power true name I summon you, I open way you, I call upon manifest me."  Neville snapped fingers.  And Neville opened eyes.  Lesath Lestrange staring him.  The four Gryffindors staring him.  The handsome one started chuckle, set three.  "Was Harry Potter supposed step around corner something?" said handsome one. "Aw. Looks like stood up."  The handsome one took menacing step forward toward Neville.  The three followed lockstep.  "Ahem," said Harry Potter behind them, leaning wall window, dead end hallway, nobody could possibly gotten without seen.  If watching people scream always felt good, Neville could sort understand people became bullies.  Harry Potter stalked forward, placing Lesath Lestrange others. He swept icy gaze across boys red-trimmed robes, eyes came rest handsome one, ringleader. "Mr. Carl Sloper," said Harry Potter. "I believe I comprehended situation fully. If Lesath Lestrange ever committed single evil himself, rather born wrong parents, fact known you. If I mistaken this, Mr. Sloper, I suggest inform once."  Neville saw fear awe boys' faces. He feeling himself. Harry claimed would trick, could be?  "But he's Lestrange," said ringleader.  "He's boy lost parents," Harry Potter said, voice growing even colder.  This time three Gryffindors flinched.  "So," said Harry Potter. "You saw Neville want tormenting innocent boy behalf Longbottoms. This failed move you. If I tell Boy-Who-Lived also thinks wrong, today terrible mistake, make difference?"  The ringleader took step toward Harry.  The others follow him.  "Carl," one said, swallowing. "Maybe go."  "They say going next Dark Lord," ringleader said, staring Harry.  A grin crossed Harry Potter's face. "They also say I'm secretly betrothed Ginevra Weasley there's prophecy us conquering France." The smile faded. "Since determined force issue, Mr. Carl Sloper, let make things clear. Leave Lesath alone. I know don't."  "So Lessy snarked you," said ringleader coldly.  "Sure," said Harry Potter dryly, "and also told today left Charms class, private secluded place one could see you, certain Hufflepuff girl wearing white ribbon hair -"  The ringleader's jaw dropped shock.  "Eep," said one Gryffindors high-pitched voice, spun heels ran around corner. His footsteps rapidly pattered away faded.  And six.  "Ah," said Harry Potter, "there goes slightly intelligent young man. The rest could stand learn Bertram Kirke's example, get into, shall say, trouble."  "Are threatening snark us?" said handsome Gryffindor, voice trying angry, rather wavering. "Bad things happen snarkers."  The two Gryffindors started slowly moving back.  Harry Potter started laughing. "Oh, say that. Are really trying intimidate me? Me? Now honestly, think scarier Peregrine Derrick, Severus Snape matter You-Know-Who?"  Even ringleader flinched that.  Harry Potter raised hand, fingers poised, three Gryffindors leaped backward, one blurted "Don't - !"  "See," said Harry Potter, "this I snap fingers become part hilariously amusing story told much nervous laughter dinner tonight. But thing is, people I trust keep telling that. Professor McGonagall told I taking easy way everything Professor Quirrell says I need learn lose. So remember story I let get beaten older Slytherins? We could that. You could bully I could let you. Only remember part end I tell many, many friends inside school anything it? This time we'll skip part. So go ahead. Bully me."  Harry Potter stepped forward, arms opened wide invitation.  The three Gryffindors broke ran, Neville sidestep quickly avoid getting run over.  There silence, footsteps faded, silence that.  And three.  Harry Potter drew deep breath, exhaled. "Whew," said. "How doing, Neville?"  Neville's voice came high-pitched squeak. "Okay, really cool."  A grin flashed across Harry Potter's face. "You pretty cool too, know."  Neville knew Harry Potter saying that, trying make feel good, still started warm glow inside chest.  Harry turned toward Lesath Lestrange -  "Are okay, Lestrange?" said Neville Harry could open mouth.  Now something expect find saying, ever.  Lesath Lestrange turned slowly, stared Neville, face tight, longer crying, tears glistening dried.  "You think know is?" said Lesath, voice high shaking. "You think know? My parents Azkaban, I try think always remind me, think great Mother cold dark Dementors sucking away life, I wish I like Harry Potter, least parents hurting, parents always hurting, every second every day, I wish I like you, least see parents sometimes, least know loved you, Mother ever loved Dementors eaten thought -"  Neville's eyes wide shock. He expected this.  Lesath turned Harry Potter, whose eyes full horror.  Lesath flung floor front Harry Potter, touched forehead ground, whispered, "Help me, Lord."  There awful silence. Neville think single thing say, naked shock Harry's face, think anything either.  "They say anything, please, please Lord, get parents Azkaban, I'll loyal servant forever, life death well, please -"  "Lesath," Harry said, voice breaking, "Lesath, I can't, I can't really things like that, stupid tricks."  "It's not!" said Lesath, voice high desperate. "I saw it, stories true, can!"  Harry swallowed. "Lesath, I set whole thing Neville, planned advance, ask him!"  They had, though Harry said going it...  When Lesath looked floor face ghastly, voice came shriek hurt Neville's ears. "You son mudblood! You could get out, won't! I got knees begged still help! I known, Boy-Who-Lived, think belongs there!"  "I can't!" Harry said, voice desperate Lesath's. "It's question I want, I power!"  Lesath rose feet, spat floor front Harry, turned walked away. When around corner sound feet sped up, faded Neville thought heard single sob.  And two.  Neville looked Harry.  Harry looked Neville.  "Wow," Neville said quietly. "He seem grateful rescued."  "He thought I could help him," Harry said, voice hoarse. "He hope first time years."  Neville swallowed, said it. "I'm sorry."  "Wha?" said Harry, sounding totally confused.  "I grateful helped -"  "Every single thing said completely right," said Boy-Who-Lived.  "No," Neville said, "it wasn't."  They simultaneously gave brief sad smiles, condescending other.  "I know real," said Neville, "I know I done anything here, thanks letting pretend."  "Give break," said Harry.  Harry turned Neville, staring window gloomy clouds.  A completely ridiculous thought came Neville. "Are feeling guilty can't get Lesath's parents Azkaban?"  "No," said Harry.  A seconds went by.  "Yes," said Harry.  "You're silly," said Neville.  "I aware this," said Harry.  "Do literally anything anyone asks you?"  The Boy-Who-Lived turned back looked Neville again. "Do? No. Feel guilty doing? Yes."  Neville trouble finding words. "Once Dark Lord died, Bellatrix Black literally evil person entire world went Azkaban. She tortured mother father insanity wanted find happened Dark Lord -"  "I know," Harry said quietly. "I get that, -"  "No! You don't! She reason that, parents Aurors! It's even close worst thing ever done!" Neville's voice shaking.  "Even so," said Boy-Who-Lived, eyes distant stared somewhere else, place Neville imagine. "There might incredibly clever solution makes possible save everyone let live happily ever after, I smart enough I would thought -"  "You problems," said Neville. "You think ought Lesath Lestrange thinks are."  "Yeah," said Boy-Who-Lived, "that pretty much nails it. Every time someone cries prayer I can't answer, I feel guilty God."  Neville quite understand that, but... "That sound good."  Harry sighed. "I understand I problem, I know I need to solve it, right? I'm working it."   Harry watched Neville leave.  Of course Harry said solution was.  The solution, obviously, hurry become God.  Neville's footsteps moved off, soon could longer heard.  And one.  "Ahem," said Severus Snape's voice directly behind him.  Harry let small scream instantly hated himself.  Slowly, Harry turned around.  The tall greasy man spotted robes leaning wall position Harry occupied.  "A fine invisibility cloak, Potter," drawled Potions Master. "Much explained."  Oh, bloody crap.  "And perhaps I Dumbledore's company long," said Severus, "but I cannot help wonder Cloak Invisibility."  Harry immediately turned someone who'd never heard Cloak Invisibility exactly smart Harry thought Severus thought Harry was.  "Oh, possibly," said Harry. "I trust realize implications, is?"  Severus's voice condescending. "You idea I'm talking about, you, Potter? A rather clumsy try fishing."  (Professor Quirrell remarked lunch Harry really needed conceal state mind better putting blank face someone discussed dangerous topic, explained one-level deceptions, two-level deceptions, on. So either Severus fact modeling Harry one-level player, made Severus two-level, Harry's three-level move successful; Severus four-level player wanted Harry think deception successful. Harry, smiling, asked Professor Quirrell level played at, Professor Quirrell, also smiling, responded, One level higher you.)  "So watching whole time," said Harry. "Disillusionment, I think called."  A thin smile. "It would foolish take slightest risk came harm."  "And wanted see results test firsthand," said Harry. "So. Am I like father?"  A strange sad expression came man, one looked foreign face. "I sooner say, Harry Potter, resemble -"  Severus stopped short.  He stared Harry.  "Lestrange called son mudblood," Severus said slowly. "It seem bother much."  Harry furrowed eyebrows. "Not circumstances, no."  "You'd helped him," Severus said. His eyes intent Harry. "And threw back face. Surely something forgive?"  "He'd pretty harrowing experience," Harry said. "And I think rescued first-years helped pride much, either."  "I suppose easy enough forgive," Severus said, voice odd, "since Lestrange means nothing you. Just strange Slytherin. If friend, perhaps, would felt far injured said."  "If friend," Harry said, "all reason forgive him."  There long silence. Harry felt, said where, air filling dreadful tension, like water rising, rising, rising.  Then Severus smiled, looking suddenly relaxed more, tension vanished.  "You forgiving person," Severus said, still smiling. "I suppose stepfather, Michael Verres-Evans, one taught you."  "More like Dad's science fiction fantasy collection," said Harry. "Sort fifth parent, really. I've lived lives characters books, mighty wisdom thunders head. Somewhere someone like Lesath, I expect, though I say who. It hard put shoes. And books told it, too. The good guys forgive."  Severus gave light, amused laugh. "I'm afraid I know much good people do."  Harry looked him. That kind sad, actually. "I'll lend novels good people them, like."  "I like ask advice something," Severus said, voice casual. "I know another fifth-year Slytherin bullied Gryffindors. He wooing beautiful Muggleborn girl, came across bullied, tried rescue him. And called mudblood, end them. He apologized, many times, never forgave him. Have thoughts could said done, win forgiveness gave Lestrange?"  "Erm," Harry said, "based information, I'm sure main one problem. I'd told date someone incapable forgiveness. Suppose they'd gotten married, imagine life household?"  There pause.  "Oh, could forgive," Severus said amusement voice. "Why, afterward, went became girlfriend bully. Tell me, would forgive bully, bullied?"  Harry shrugged. "At wild guess, bully hurt someone else badly, bullied hurt little, felt far unforgivable somehow. Or, put fine point it, bully handsome? Or matter, rich?"  There another pause.  "Yes both," said Severus.  "And it," said Harry. "Not I've ever high school myself, books give understand there's certain kind teenage girl who'll outraged single insult boy plain poor, yet somehow find room heart forgive rich handsome boy bullying. She shallow, words. Tell whoever worthy needs get move next time date girls deep instead pretty."  Severus stared Harry silence, eyes glittering. The smile faded, though Severus's face twitched, return.  Harry starting feel bit nervous. "Um, I've got experience area myself, obviously, I think that's wise adviser books would say."  There silence glittering.  It probably good time change subject.  "So," Harry said. "Did I pass test, whatever was?"  "I think," Severus said, "that conversations us, Potter, would exceedingly wise never speak one."  Harry blinked. "Would mind telling I wrong?"  "You offended me," said Severus. "And I longer trust cunning."  Harry stared Severus, taken rather aback.  "But given well-meant advice," said Severus Snape, "and I give true advice return." His voice almost perfectly steady. Like string stretched almost perfectly horizontal, despite massive weight hanging middle, million tons tension pulling either end. "You almost died today, Potter. In future, never share wisdom anyone unless know exactly talking about."  Harry's mind finally made connection.  "You -"  Harry's mouth snapped shut almost died part sank in, two seconds late.  "Yes," said Severus, "I was."  And terrible tension flooded back room like water pressurized bottom ocean.  Harry breathe.  Lose. Now.  "I know," Harry whispered. "I'm s-"  "No," said Severus. Just one word.  Harry stood silence, mind frantically searching options. Severus stood window, real pity, fall height kill wizard.  "Your books betrayed you, Potter," said Severus, still voice stretched tight million tons pull. "They tell one thing needed know. You cannot learn stories like lose one love. That something could never understand without feeling yourself."  "My father," Harry whispered. It best guess, one thing might save him. "My father tried protect bullies."  A ghastly smile stretched across Severus's face, man moved toward Harry.  And past him.  "Goodbye, Potter," said Severus, looking back way out. "We shall little say today on."  And corner, man stopped, without turning, spoke one final time.  "Your father bully," said Severus Snape, "and mother saw something I never understand day."  He left.  Harry turned walked toward window. His shaking hands went onto ledge.  Never give anyone wise advice unless know exactly talking about. Got it.  Harry stared clouds light drizzle while. The window looked east grounds, afternoon, sun visible clouds all, Harry see it.  His hands stopped shaking, tight feeling Harry's chest, like compressed metal bands.  So father bully.  And mother shallow.  Maybe they'd grown later. Good people like Professor McGonagall seem think world them, might heroic martyrs.  Of course, scant consolation eleven turn teenager, wondering sort teenager might become.  So terrible.  So sad.  Such awful life Harry led.  Learning genetic parents perfect, why, ought spend awhile moping that, feeling sorry himself.  Maybe could complain Lesath Lestrange.  Harry read Dementors. Cold darkness surrounded them, fear, sucked away happy thoughts absence worst memories rose surface.  He could imagine Lesath's shoes, knowing parents Azkaban life, place one ever escaped.  And Lesath would imagining mother's place, cold darkness fear, alone worst memories, even dreams, every second every day.  For instant Harry imagined Mum Dad Azkaban Dementors sucking life, draining away happy memories love him. Just instant, imagination blew fuse called emergency shutdown told never imagine again.  Was right to anyone, even second evil person world?  No, said wisdom Harry's books, there's way, way all.  And unless wizarding justice system perfect prisons - sounded rather improbable, things considered - somewhere Azkaban person entirely innocent, probably one.  There burning sensation Harry's throat, moisture gathering eyes, wanted teleport Azkaban's prisoners safety call fire sky blast terrible place bedrock. But couldn't, God.  And Harry remembered Professor Quirrell said beneath starlight: Sometimes, flawed world seems unusually hateful, I wonder whether might place, far away, I been... But stars very, far away... And I wonder I would dream about, I slept long, long time.     Right flawed world seemed unusually hateful.  And Harry understand Professor Quirrell's words, might alien spoken, Artificial Intelligence, something built along different lines Harry brain forced operate mode.  You leave home planet still contained place like Azkaban.  You stay fight.   Chapter 28: Reductionism  Whatever go Rowling go Rowling.  This go without saying, views expressed Severus Snape necessarily author.   "Okay," Harry said, swallowing. "Okay, Hermione, enough, stop."  The white sugar pill front Hermione still changed shape color all, even though concentrating harder Harry ever seen, eyes squeezed shut, beads sweat forehead, hand trembling gripped wand -  "Hermione, stop! It's going work, Hermione, I think make things exist yet!"  Slowly, Hermione's hand relaxed grasp wand.  "I thought I felt it," said bare whisper. "I thought I felt start Transfigure, second."  There lump Harry's throat. "You probably imagining it. Hoping hard."  "I probably was," said. She looked like wanted cry.  Slowly, Harry took mechanical pencil hand, reached sheet paper items crossed out, drew line item said 'ALZHEIMER'S CURE'.  They fed anyone Transfigured pill. But Transfiguration, least kind could do, enchant targets - Transfigure regular broomstick flying one. So Hermione able make pill all, would nonmagical pill, one worked ordinary material reasons. They could secretly made pills Muggle science lab, let study pills try reverse-engineer Transfiguration wore off... one either world would need know magic involved, would another scientific breakthrough...  It sort thing wizard would think of, either. They respect mere patterns atoms much, think unenchanted material things objects power. If magical, interesting.  Earlier, Harry secretly - even told Hermione - tried Transfigure nanotechnology la Eric Drexler. (He'd tried produce desktop nanofactory, course, tiny self-replicating assemblers, Harry insane.) It would godhood single shot it'd worked.  "That today, right?" said Hermione. She slumped back chair, leaning head back; face showed tiredness, unusual Hermione. She liked pretend limitless, least Harry around.  "One more," Harry said cautiously, "but one's small, plus might actually work. I saved last I hoping could end note. It's real stuff, like phasers. They've already made laboratory, like Alzheimer's cure. And generic substance, specific like lost books tried Transfigure copies of. I made diagram molecular structure show you. We want make longer ever made before, tubes aligned, endpoints embedded diamond." Harry produced sheet graph paper.  Hermione sat back up, took it, studied it, frowning. "These carbon atoms? And Harry, what's name? I can't Transfigure I know called."  Harry made disgusted face. He still trouble getting used sort thing, matter something named knew was. "They're called buckytubes, carbon nanotubes. It's kind fullerene discovered year. It's hundred times stronger steel sixth weight."  Hermione looked graph paper, face surprised. "That's real?"  "Yeah," Harry said, "just hard make Muggle way. If could get enough stuff, could use build space elevator way geosynchronous orbit higher, terms delta-v that's halfway anywhere Solar System. Plus could throw solar power satellites like confetti."  Hermione frowning again. "Is stuff safe?"  "I see be," Harry said. "A buckytube graphite sheet wrapped circular tube, basically, graphite stuff used pencils -"  "I know graphite is, Harry," Hermione said. She brushed hair back absentmindedly, eyebrows furrowed stared sheet paper.  Harry reached pocket robes, produced white thread tied two small gray plastic rings either end. He'd added drops superglue thread met either ring, make single object could Transfigured whole. Cyanoacrylate, Harry remembered correctly, worked covalent bonds, close "solid object" ever got world ultimately composed tiny individual atoms. "When ready," Harry said, "try Transfigure set aligned buckytube fibers embedded two solid diamond rings."  "All right..." Hermione said slowly. "Harry, I feel like I missed something."  Harry shrugged helplessly. Maybe tired. He knew better say loud, though.  Hermione laid wand one plastic ring, stared while.  Two small circles glittering diamond lay table, connected long black thread.  "It changed," said Hermione. She sounded like trying enthusiastic run energy. "Now what?"  Harry felt bit deflated research partner's lack passion, best show it; maybe process would work reverse cheer up. "Now I test see holds weight."  There A-frame Harry rigged earlier experiment diamond rods - could make solid diamond objects easily, using Transfiguration, last. The earlier experiment measured whether Transfiguring long diamond rod shorter diamond rod would allow lift suspended heavy weight contracted, i.e., could Transfigure tension, fact could.  Harry carefully looped one circle glittering diamond thick metal hook top rig, attached thick metal hanger bottom ring, started attaching weights hanger.  (Harry asked Weasley twins Transfigure apparatus him, Weasley twins given incredulous look, like figure sort prank could possibly want for, asked questions. And Transfigurations, according them, lasted around three hours, Harry Hermione still left.)  "One hundred kilograms," Harry said minute later. "I think steel thread thin would hold that. It go much higher, that's weight I've got."  There silence.  Harry straightened up, went back table, sat chair, ceremoniously made check mark next 'Buckytubes'. "There," Harry said. "That one worked."  "But really useful, Harry, it?" Hermione said sitting head resting hands. "I mean, even gave scientist learn make lots buckytubes studying ours."  "They might able learn something," Harry said. "Hermione, look it, little tiny thread holding weight, made something Muggle laboratory could make -"  "But witch could make it," Hermione said. Her exhaustion coming voice, now. "Harry, I think working out."  "You mean relationship?" Harry said. "Great! Let's break up."  That got slight grin her. "I mean research."  "Oh, Hermione, could you?"  "You're sweet mean," said. "But Harry, nuts, I'm twelve, eleven, silly think we're going discover anything one's ever figured before."  "Are really saying give unraveling secrets magic trying less one month?" Harry said, trying put note challenge voice. Honestly feeling fatigue Hermione. None good ideas ever worked. He'd made one discovery worth mentioning, Mendelian pattern, tell Hermione without breaking promise Draco.  "No," Hermione said. Her young face looking serious adult. "I'm saying right studying magic wizards already know, sort thing graduate Hogwarts."  "Um..." Harry said. "Hermione, I hate put way, imagine we'd decided hold research later, first thing tried graduated Transfiguring Alzheimer's cure, worked. We'd feel... I think word stupid would adequately describe we'd feel. What there's something else like work?"  "That's fair, Harry!" Hermione said. Her voice trembling like verge breaking crying. "You can't put people! It's job sort thing, we're kids!"  For moment Harry wondered would happen someone told Hermione fight immortal Dark Lord, would turn one whiny self-pitying heroes Harry could never stand reading books.  "Anyway," Hermione said. Her voice shook. "I want keep this. I believe children things grownups can't, that's stories."  There silence classroom.  Hermione started look little scared, Harry knew expression gotten colder.  It might hurt much thought already come Harry - that, thirty might old scientific revolutionary twenty right, people got doctorates seventeen fourteen-year-old heirs who'd great kings generals, really anyone who'd made history books eleven.  "All right," Harry said. "Figure something grownup can't. Is challenge?"  "I mean like that," Hermione said, voice coming frightened whisper.  With effort, Harry wrenched gaze away Hermione. "I'm angry you," Harry said. His voice cold, despite best efforts. "I'm angry at, I know, everything. But I'm willing lose, Hermione. Losing always right thing do. I'll figure something grown wizard can't do, I'll get back you. How's that?"  There silence.  "Okay," said Hermione, voice wavering little. She pushed chair, went door abandoned classroom they'd working in. Her hand went onto doorknob. "We're still friends, right? And can't figure anything -"  Her voice halted.  "Then we'll study together," Harry said. His voice even colder now.  "Um, bye now, then," Hermione said, quickly went room shut door behind her.  Sometimes Harry hated dark side, even inside it.  And part thought exactly thing Hermione, no, children grownups couldn't, saying things Hermione frightened say, like, That's one hell difficult challenge grabbed boy going end egg face time least way know failed.  And part enjoy losing replied, cold voice, Fine, shut watch.   It almost lunchtime, Harry care. He even bothered grabbing snack bar pouch. His stomach could stand little starving.  The wizarding world tiny, think like scientists, know science, question they'd grown with, put protective shells time machines, played Quidditch, magical Britain smaller small Muggle city, greatest wizarding school educated age seventeen, silly challenging eleven, silly assuming wizards knew already exhausted low-hanging fruit scientific polymath would see.  Step One make list every magical constraint Harry could remember, things supposedly do.  Step Two, mark constraints seemed make least sense scientific perspective.  Step Three, prioritize constraints wizard would unlikely question know science.  Step Four, come avenues attacking them.   Hermione still felt little shaky sat next Mandy Ravenclaw table. Hermione's lunch two fruits (tomato slices peeled tangerines), three vegetables (carrots, carrots, carrots), one meat (fried Diricawl drumsticks whose unhealthy coating would carefully remove), one little piece chocolate cake would earn eating parts.  It bad Potions class, sometimes still nightmares that. But time made happen she'd felt like target. Just moment, terrible cold darkness looked away said angry her, wanted scare her.  And still feeling like she'd missed something earlier, something really important.  But violated rules Transfiguration... they? They made liquids, gases, taken orders Defense Professor...  The pill! That something eaten!  ...well, no, nobody would eat pill lying around, worked actually, could Finite Incantatemed had, would still tell Harry make sure mention front Professor McGonagall, case never allowed study Transfiguration again...  Hermione starting get really sick feeling stomach. She pushed back plate table, eat lunch like this.  And closed eyes began mentally recite rules Transfiguration.  "I never Transfigure anything liquid gas."  "I never Transfigure anything looks like food anything else goes inside human body."  No, really tried Transfigure pill, least realized... she'd caught Harry's brilliant idea thought...  The sick feeling Hermione's stomach getting worse. There feeling mind something hovering edge recognition, perception invert itself, young woman become crone, vase become two faces...  And went remembering rules Transfiguration.   Harry's knuckles gone white wand time stopped trying Transfigure air front wand paperclip. It safe Transfigure paperclip gas, course, Harry see reason would unsafe way around. It supposed possible. But not? Air real substance anything else...  Well, maybe limitation make sense. Air disorganized, molecules constantly changing relation other. Maybe impose new form substance unless substance staying still long enough master it, even though atoms solids also constantly vibrating time...  The Harry failed, colder felt, clearer everything seemed become.  All right. Next list.  You could Transfigure whole objects wholes. You Transfigure half match needle, Transfigure whole thing. Back Harry trapped classroom Draco, reason Transfigure thin cylindrical cross-section walls sponge, punch chunk stone large enough fit hole. He would needed impose new form whole wall, maybe whole section Hogwarts, order change little cross-section.  And ridiculous.  Things made atoms. Lots little tiny dots. There contiguity, solidity, electromagnetic forces holding little dots related other...   Mandy Brocklehurst paused fork way mouth. "Huh," said Su Li, sitting across now-empty space beside her, "what got Hermione?"   Harry wanted kill eraser.  He'd trying change single spot pink rectangle steel, apart rest rubber, eraser cooperating.  It conceptual limitation, real one. Had be.  Things made atoms, every atom tiny separate thing. Atoms held together quantum mist shared electrons, covalent bonds, sometimes magnetism close ranges, ionic bonds van der Waals forces.  If came that, protons neutrons inside nuclei tiny separate things. The quarks inside protons neutrons tiny separate things! There simply anything reality, world-out-there, corresponded people's conceit solid objects. It little dots.  And free Transfiguration mind begin with, it? No words, gestures. Only pure concept form, kept strictly separate substance, imposed substance, conceived apart form. That wand whatever made wizard.  The wizards transform parts things, could transform minds perceived wholes, know bones atoms deep down.  Harry focused knowledge hard could, true fact eraser collection atoms, everything collections atoms, atoms little patch trying Transfigure formed valid collection collection cared think about.  And Harry still able change single part eraser, Transfiguration going anywhere.  This. Was. Ridiculous.  Harry's knuckles whitening wand again. He sick getting experimental results make sense.  Maybe fact part mind still thinking terms objects stopping Transfiguration going through. He thought collection atoms eraser. He thought collection little patch.  Time kick notch.  Harry pressed wand harder tiny section eraser, tried see illusion nonscientists thought reality, world desks chairs, air erasers people.  When walked park, immersive world surrounded something existed inside brain pattern neurons firing. The sensation bright blue sky something high you, something visual cortex, visual cortex back brain. All sensations bright world really happening quiet cave bone called skull, place lived never, ever left. If really wanted say hello someone, actual person, shake hand, knock gently skull say "How there?" That people were, really lived. And picture park thought walking something visualized inside brain processed signals sent eyes retina.  It lie like Buddhists thought, something terribly mystical unexpected behind veil Maya, lay beyond illusion park actual park, still illusion.  Harry sitting inside classroom.  He looking eraser.  Harry inside Harry's skull.  He experiencing processed picture brain decoded signals sent retina.  The real eraser somewhere else, somewhere picture.  And real eraser like picture Harry's brain it. The idea eraser solid object something existed inside brain, inside parietal cortex processed sense shape space. The real eraser collection atoms held together electromagnetic forces shared covalent electrons, nearby, air molecules bounced bounced eraser-molecules.  The real eraser far away, Harry, inside skull, could never quite touch it, could imagine ideas it. But wand power, could change things reality, Harry's preconceptions limiting it. Somewhere beyond veil Maya, truth behind Harry's concept "my wand" touching collection atoms Harry's mind thought "a patch eraser", wand could change collection atoms Harry considered "the whole eraser", absolutely reason change collection too...  The Transfiguration still going through.  Harry's teeth clenched together, kicked another notch.  The concept Harry's mind eraser single object obvious nonsense.  It map match territory.  Human beings modeled world using stratified levels organization, separate thoughts countries worked, people worked, organs worked, cells worked, molecules worked, quarks worked.  When Harry's brain needed think eraser, would think rules governed erasers, like "erasers get rid pencil-marks". Only Harry's brain needed predict would happen lower chemical level, would Harry's brain start thinking - though separate fact - rubber molecules.  But mind.  Harry's mind might separate beliefs rules governed erasers, separate law physics governed erasers.  Harry's mind modeled reality using multiple levels organization, different beliefs level. But map, true territory like that, reality single level organization, quarks, unified low-level process obeying mathematically simple rules.  Or least Harry believed he'd found magic, eraser magical.  And even eraser magical, idea could really exist single solid eraser impossible. Things like erasers basic elements reality, big complicated atoms, made parts. You things fundamentally complicated. The implicit belief Harry's brain eraser single object wrong, map-territory confusion, eraser existed separate concept Harry's multi-level model world, separate element single-level reality.  ...the Transfiguration still happening.  Harry breathing heavily, failed Transfiguration almost tiring successful Transfiguration, damned he'd give now.  All right, screw nineteenth-century garbage.  Reality atoms, set tiny billiard balls bopping around. That another lie. The notion atoms little dots another convenient hallucination people clung want confront inhumanly alien shape underlying reality. No wonder, then, attempts Transfigure based worked. If wanted power, abandon humanity, force thoughts conform true math quantum mechanics.  There particles, clouds amplitude multiparticle configuration space brain fondly imagined eraser nothing except gigantic factor wavefunction happened factorize, separate existence particular solid factor 3 hidden inside number 6, wand capable altering factors approximately factorizable wavefunction damn well able alter slightly smaller factor Harry's brain visualized patch material eraser -   Hermione tore hallways, shoes pounding hard stone, breath coming pants, shock adrenaline still racing blood.  Like picture young woman turning old crone, like cup becoming two faces.  What doing?  What doing?  She came classroom fingers slipped doorknob first, sweaty, grabbed harder door opened -  - single flash perception saw Harry staring small pink rectangle table front -  - paces away tiny black thread, almost invisible distance, supported weight -  "Harry get classroom!"  Pure shock crossed Harry's face, stood fast almost fell over, stopping grab small pink rectangle table, tore door, she'd already stepped aside, wand already hand coming pointing thread -  "Finite Incantatem!"  And Hermione slammed door shut again, gigantic crash hundred kilograms falling metal came inside.  She panting, gasping air, she'd run way without stopping, soaked sweat legs thighs burned like living flames, answered Harry's questions Galleons world.  Hermione blinked, realized started fall, Harry caught her, lowering gently sit floor.  "...healthy..." managed whisper.  "What?" said Harry, looking paler she'd ever seen him.  "...are you, feeling, healthy..."  Harry started looking even frightened question sank in. "I, I think I symptoms -"  Hermione closed eyes moment. "Good," whispered. "Catch, breath."  That took while. Harry still looking scared. That good too, maybe would teach lesson.  Hermione reached pouch Harry bought her, whispered "water" parched throat, took bottle drank great huge gulps.  And still could talk again.  "We broke rules, Harry," said hoarse voice. "We broke rules."  "I..." Harry swallowed. "I still see how, I've thinking -"  "I asked Transfiguration safe answered me!"  There pause.  "That's it?" Harry said.  She could screamed.  "Harry, get it?" said. "It's made tiny fibers, unraveled, knows could go wrong, ask Professor McGonagall! Don't see doing? We experimenting Transfiguration. We experimenting Transfiguration!"  There another pause.  "Right..." Harry said slowly. "That's probably one things even bother telling obvious. Don't test brilliant new ideas Transfiguration unused classroom without consulting professors."  "You could gotten us killed, Harry!" Hermione knew fair, she'd made mistake too, still felt angry him, always sounded confident dragged unthinkingly along wake. "We could spoiled Professor McGonagall's perfect record!"  "Yes," said Harry, "let's tell this, shall we?"  "We stop," Hermione said. "We stop we're going get hurt. We're young, Harry, can't this, yet."  A weak grin crossed Harry's face. "Um, sort wrong that."  And held small pink rectangle, rubber eraser bright metal patch it.  Hermione stared it, puzzled.  "Quantum mechanics enough," Harry said. "I go way timeless physics took. Had see wand enforcing relation separate past future realities, instead changing anything time - I it, Hermione, I saw past illusion objects, I bet there's single wizard world could have. Even Muggleborn knew timeless formulations quantum mechanics, would weird belief strange distant quantum stuff, see reality, accept world knew hallucination. I Transfigured part eraser without changing whole thing."  Hermione raised wand again, pointed eraser.  For moment anger crossed Harry's face, make move stop her.  "Finite Incantatem," said Hermione. "Check Professor McGonagall try again."  Harry nodded, though face still bit tight.  "And still stop," said Hermione.  "Why?" said Harry. "Don't see means, Hermione? Wizards know everything! There's them, even fewer know science, exhausted low-hanging fruit -"  "It's safe," Hermione said. "If find new things even less safe! We're young! We made one big mistake already, next time could die!"  Then Hermione flinched.  Harry looked away her, started taking slow, deep breaths.  "Please try alone, Harry," Hermione said, voice trembling. "Please."  Please make decide whether tell Professor Flitwick.  There long pause.  "So want us study," Harry said. She could tell trying keep anger voice. "Just study."  Hermione sure say anything, but... "Like studied, um, timeless physics, right?"  Harry looked back her.  "That thing did," Hermione said, voice tentative, "it experiments, right? You could read lots books."  Harry opened mouth, shut again. There frustrated look face.  "All right," Harry said. "How this. We study, I think anything seems really worth trying, we'll try I ask professor."  "Okay," Hermione said. She fall relief, already sitting down.  "Shall get lunch?" Harry said cautiously.  Hermione nodded. Yes. Lunch sounded good. For real, time.  She carefully began push stone floor, wincing body screamed -  Harry pointed wand said "Wingardium Leviosa."  Hermione blinked huge weight legs diminished something bearable.  A smile quirked across Harry's face. "You lift something without able Hover completely," said. "Remember experiment?"  Hermione smiled back helplessly, although thought ought still angry.  And started walking back toward Great Hall, feeling remarkably wonderfully light feet, Harry carefully kept wand trained her.  He managed keep five minutes, thought counted.   Minerva looked Dumbledore.  Dumbledore gazed back inquiringly her. "Did understand that?" Headmaster said, sounding bemused.  It complete utter gibberish Minerva could ever remember hearing. She feeling bit embarrassed summoned Headmaster hear it, she'd given explicit instructions.  "I'm afraid not," Professor McGonagall said primly.  "So," Dumbledore said. The silver beard swung away her, old wizard's twinkling gaze looked elsewhere more. "You suspect might able something wizards can't do, something think impossible."  The three stood within Headmaster's private Transfiguration workroom, shining phoenix Dumbledore's Patronus told bring Harry, moments Patronus reached him. Light shone skylights illuminated great seven-pointed alchemical diagram drawn center circular room, showing little dusty, saddened Minerva. Transfiguration research one Dumbledore's great enjoyments, she'd known pressed time he'd lately, pressed.  And Harry Potter going waste even Headmaster's time. But certainly blame Harry that. He'd done proper thing coming to say he'd idea something Transfiguration currently believed impossible, done exactly she'd told do: she'd ordered Harry quiet discuss anything consulted Headmaster they'd finished moving secure location.  If Harry started saying specifically thought could do, bothered.  "Look, I know hard explain," Harry said, sounding little embarrassed. "What adds believe conflicts scientists believe, case I'd genuinely expect scientists know wizards."  Minerva would sighed loud, Dumbledore seemed taking whole thing seriously.  Harry's idea stemmed simple ignorance, nothing more. If changed half metal ball glass, whole ball different Form. To change part change whole, meant removing whole Form replacing different one. What would even mean Transfigure half metal ball? That metal ball whole Form before, half ball different Form?  "Mr. Potter," said Professor McGonagall, "what want impossible, illogical. If change half something, change whole."  "Indeed," said Dumbledore. "But Harry hero, may able things logically impossible."  Minerva would rolled eyes, gone numb long time ago.  "Supposing possible," said Dumbledore, "can think reason results would differ way ordinary Transfiguration?"  Minerva frowned. The fact concept literally unimaginable presenting difficulty, tried take face value. A Transfiguration imposed half metal ball...  "Strange things happening interface?" said Minerva. "But different Transfiguring object whole, Form two different parts..."  Dumbledore nodded. "That thought well. And Harry, theory correct, implies want exactly like Transfiguration, applied part subject rather whole? No changes all?"  "Yes," Harry said firmly. "That's whole point."  Dumbledore looked again. "Minerva, think reason whatsoever would dangerous?"  "No," said Minerva, finished searching memory.  "Likewise myself," said Headmaster. "All right, then, since ought exactly analogous ordinary Transfiguration respects, since cannot think reason whatsoever would dangerous, I think second degree caution suffice."  Minerva surprised, object. Dumbledore far senior Transfiguration, tried literally thousands new Transfigurations without ever choosing degree caution low. He used Transfiguration combat still alive. If Headmaster thought second degree enough, enough.  That Harry certainly going fail was, course, completely irrelevant.  The two started setting wards detection webs. The important web one checked make sure Transfigured material entered air. Harry would enclosed separate shell force air supply certain, wand allowed leave shield, interface tight. They inside Hogwarts automatically Apparate material showed signs spontaneous combustion, could launch skylight almost fast, windows folded outward exactly reason. Harry would go different skylight first sign trouble.  Harry watched working, face looking little frightened.  "Don't worry," said Professor McGonagall middle running description, "this almost certainly necessary, Mr. Potter. If expected anything go wrong would allowed try. It's ordinary precautions Transfiguration one ever tried before."  Harry swallowed nodded.  And minutes later, Harry strapped safety chair resting wand metal ball - one that, based current test scores, large Transfigure less thirty minutes.  And minutes that, Minerva leaning wall, feeling faint.  There small patch glass ball Harry's wand rested.  Harry say I told so, smug look sweating face said him.  Dumbledore casting analytic Charms ball, looking more intrigued moment. Thirty years melted face.  "Fascinating," said Dumbledore. "It's exactly claimed. He simply Transfigured part subject without Transfiguring whole. You say really conceptual limitation, Harry?"  "Yes," Harry said, "but deep one, knowing conceptual limitation enough. I suppress part mind making error think instead underlying reality scientists figured out."  "Truly fascinating," Dumbledore said. "I take wizard would require months study could all? And may I ask partially Transfigure subjects?"  "Probably yes course," Harry said.  Half hour later, Minerva feeling equally bewildered, considerably reassured safety issues.  It same, aside logically impossible.  "I believe that's enough, Headmaster," Minerva said finally. "I suspect partial Transfiguration tiring ordinary sort."  "Getting less practice," said exhausted pale boy, voice unsteady, "but yeah, got right."  The process extracting Harry wards took another minute, Minerva escorted much comfortable chair, Dumbledore produced ice-cream soda.  "Congratulations, Mr. Potter!" said Professor McGonagall, meant it. She would bet almost anything working.  "Congratulations indeed," said Dumbledore. "Even I make original discoveries Transfiguration age fourteen. Not since day Dorotea Senjak genius flowered early."  "Thanks," Harry said, sounding little surprised.  "Nonetheless," Dumbledore said thoughtfully, "I think would wise keep happy event secret, least now. Harry, discuss idea person spoke Professor McGonagall?"  There silence.  "Um..." Harry said. "I want turn anyone Inquisition, I tell one student -"  The word almost exploded Professor McGonagall's lips. "What? You discussed completely novel form Transfiguration student consulting recognized authority? Do idea irresponsible was?"  "I'm sorry," said Harry. "I realize."  The boy looked appropriately frightened, Minerva felt something inside relax. At least Harry understood foolish he'd been.  "You must swear Miss Granger secrecy," Dumbledore said gravely. "And tell anyone else unless extremely good reason it, sworn."  "Ah... why?" Harry said.  Minerva wondering thing. Once Headmaster thinking far ahead keep up.  "Because something one else believe do," Dumbledore said. "Something completely unexpected. It may prove critical advantage, Harry, must preserve it. Please, trust this."  Professor McGonagall nodded, firm face showing nothing inner confusion. "Please do, Mr. Potter," said.  "All right..." Harry said slowly.  "Once finished examining materials," Dumbledore added, "you may practice partial Transfiguration, glass steel steel glass only, Miss Granger act spotter. Naturally, either suspect symptom form Transfiguration sickness, inform professor once."  Just Harry left workroom, hand doorhandle, boy turned back said, "As long we're here, either noticed anything different Professor Snape?"  "Different?" said Headmaster.  Minerva let wry smile show face. Of course boy apprehensive 'evil Potions Master', since way knowing Severus trusted. It would odd say least, explaining Harry Severus still love mother.  "I mean, behavior changed recently way?" said Harry.  "Not I seen..." Headmaster said slowly. "Why ask?"  Harry shook head. "I want prejudice observations saying. Just keep eye out, maybe?"  That sent quiver unease Minerva way outright accusation Severus could have.  Harry bowed respectfully, took leave.   "Albus," Minerva said boy gone, "how know take Harry seriously? I would thought idea merely impossible!"  The old wizard's face turned grave. "The reason must kept secret, Minerva. The reason I told come me, Harry made claim. Because power Voldemort knows not."  The words took seconds sink in.  And cold shiver went spine, always remembered.  It started ordinary job interview, Sybill Trelawney applying position Professor Divination.  THE ONE WITH THE POWER TO VANQUISH THE DARK LORD APPROACHES,   BORN TO THOSE WHO HAVE THRICE DEFIED HIM,   BORN AS THE SEVENTH MONTH DIES,   AND THE DARK LORD WILL MARK HIM AS HIS EQUAL,   BUT HE WILL HAVE POWER THE DARK LORD KNOWS NOT,   AND EITHER MUST DESTROY ALL BUT A REMNANT OF THE OTHER,   FOR THOSE TWO DIFFERENT SPIRITS CANNOT EXIST IN THE SAME WORLD.  Those dreadful words, spoken terrible booming voice, seem fit something like partial Transfiguration.  "Perhaps not, then," Dumbledore said Minerva tried explain. "I confess I hoping something would help finding Voldemort's horcrux, wherever may hidden it. But..." The old wizard shrugged. "Prophecies tricky things, Minerva, best take chances. The smallest thing may prove decisive remains unexpected."  "And suppose meant Severus?" said Minerva.  "There I idea," sighed Dumbledore. "Unless Harry making move Severus, thought open question might taken seriously direct allegation would dismissed. And indeed happened, Harry correctly reasoned I would trust so. Let us simply keep watch, without prejudice, asks."   Aftermath, 1:  "Um, Hermione?" Harry said small voice. "I think I owe really, really, really big apology."   Aftermath, 2:  Alissa Cornfoot's eyes slightly glazed gazed upon Potions Master giving class stern lecture, holding tiny bronze bean saying something screaming puddles human flesh. Ever since start year she'd trouble listening Potions. She kept staring awful, mean, greasy professor fantasizing special detentions. There probably something really wrong seem stop -  "Ow!" Alissa said then.  Snape flicked bronze bean unerringly Alissa's forehead.  "Miss Cornfoot," said Potions Master, voice cutting, "this delicate potion cannot pay attention hurt classmates, yourself. See class."  The last four words help any, tried harder, managed get day without melting anyone.  After class, Alissa approached desk. Part wanted stand meekly face abashed hands clasped penitently behind back, case, quiet instinct told might bad idea. So instead stood face neutral, posture proper young lady, said, "Professor?"  "Miss Cornfoot," Snape said without looking sheets grading, "I return affections, I begin find stares disturbing, restrain eyes henceforth. Is quite clear?"  "Yes," said Alissa strangled squeak, Snape dismissed her, fled classroom cheeks flaming like molten lava.   Chapter 29: Egocentric Bias  Unfortunately, one told J. K. Rowling is. You see yourself.  Science disclaimers: Luosha points theory empathy Ch. 27 (you use brain simulate others) quite known scientific fact. The evidence far points direction, analyzed brain circuitry proven it. Similarly, timeless formulations quantum mechanics (alluded Ch. 28) elegant I'd shocked find final theory time it, they're established yet either.   There'd sinking feeling Hermione's stomach lately, every time heard students talking Harry. She'd shower stall morning she'd overheard conversation Morag Padma last straw piled top quite lot straws.  She starting think getting involved rivalry Harry Potter terrible mistake.  If she'd stayed away Harry Potter, could Hermione Granger, brightest academic star Hogwarts, earning points Ravenclaw anyone. She famous Boy-Who-Lived, would famous herself.  Instead Boy-Who-Lived academic rival, name happened Hermione Granger.  And worse, gone date him.  The idea getting Romance Harry seemed like appealing idea first. She'd read books like that, anyone Hogwarts candidate heroine's love interest obviously Harry Potter. Bright, funny, famous, sometimes scary...  So she'd forced Harry going date her.  And love interest.  Or worse, one options dinner menu.  She'd shower stall morning turn water, she'd heard giggles coming outside. And she'd heard Morag talking Muggleborn girl probably fight hard enough win Ginevra Weasley, Padma speculating Harry Potter might decide wanted both.  It like understand GIRLS options dinner menu BOYS fought them.  But even part hurt, really. It scored 98 one Professor McGonagall's tests, news Hermione Granger scored highest class, news Harry Potter's rival scored seven points him.  If got close Boy-Who-Lived, became part story.  You get own.  And thought come Hermione walk away, would've sad.  But want get back she'd accidentally given away letting become known Harry's rival. She wanted separate person instead Harry Potter's third leg, much ask?  It hard trap climb fell in. No matter high scored class, even something deserved special dinnertime announcement, meant rivaling Harry Potter again.  But thought she'd come way.  Something seen pushing opposite end Harry Potter's seesaw.  It would hard.  It would go nature.  She would fight someone evil.  And would need ask someone even evil help.  Hermione raised hand knock upon terrible door.  She hesitated.  Hermione realized silly, raised hand bit higher.  She tried knock again.  Her hand quite failed touch door.  And door swung open anyway.  "Dear me," said spider, sitting web. "Was really hard lose single Quirrell point, Miss Granger?"  Hermione stood hand raised, cheeks growing pink. It been.  "Well, Miss Granger, I shall merciful," said evil Professor Quirrell. "Consider already lost. There, I taken hard choice you. Are grateful?"  "Professor Quirrell," Hermione managed say voice squeaked little. "I lot Quirrell points, I?"  "You indeed," said Professor Quirrell. "Though one less before. Terrible, it? Just think, I like reason coming here, could lose another fifty. Maybe I'd take away one... one... one..."  Hermione's cheeks going even redder. "You're really evil, anyone ever tell that?"  "Miss Granger," Professor Quirrell said gravely, "it dangerous give people compliments like truly earned. The recipient might feel bashful undeserving want something worthy praise. Now wanted talk about, Miss Granger?"   It lunch Thursday afternoon, Hermione Harry ensconced little library nook, Quietus field could talk. Harry lying stomach-down ground elbows resting floor head hands feet kicking casually behind him. Hermione occupying stuffed chair much large her, like Hermione center candy shell.  Harry suggested could, first pass, read titles books library, Hermione could read tables contents.  Hermione thought brilliant idea. She'd never done library before.  Unfortunately slight flaw plan.  Namely, Ravenclaws.  Hermione reading book called Magical Mnemonics.     Harry reading book called The Skeptical Wizard.     Each thought one special exception would make one time, neither yet realized impossible either ever finish reading book titles matter hard tried.  The quiet little nook broken two words.  "Oh, no," Harry suddenly said loud, sounding like words torn him.  There bit quiet.  "He didn't," Harry said, voice.  Then heard Harry start giggling helplessly.  Hermione looked book.  "All right," said, "what it?"  "I found never ask Weasleys family rat," Harry said. "It's really awful I laughing I'm terrible person."  "Yes," Hermione said primly, "you are. Tell too."  "Okay, first background. There's whole chapter book Sirius Black conspiracy theories. You remember is, right?"  "Of course," said Hermione. Sirius Black traitor, friend James Potter who'd betrayed location Harry's parents Voldemort.  "So turns number of, shall say, irregularities, associated Black going Azkaban. He get trial, Junior Minister charge Aurors arrested Black none Cornelius Fudge, became current Minister Magic."  That sounded little suspicious Hermione too, said much.  Harry made shrugging motion shoulders, lay floor looking book. "Suspicious things happen time, conspiracy theorist always find something."  "But trial?" said Hermione.  "It right Dark Lord's defeat," Harry said, voice serious said it. "Things incredibly chaotic, Aurors tracked Black standing laughing street ankle-deep blood, twenty eyewitnesses recount he'd killed friend father's named Peter Pettigrew plus twelve bystanders. I'm saying I approve Black getting trial. But wizards we're talking here, really suspicious than, I know, sort thing people point want argue shot John F. Kennedy. So anyway, Sirius Black wizarding Lee Harvey Oswald. There's sorts conspiracy theories really betrayed parents instead him, one favorites Peter Pettigrew, starts getting complicated."  Hermione listened, fascinated. "But go Weasleys' pet rat -"  "Hold on," said Harry, "I'm getting there. Now, Pettigrew's death came he'd spy Light - double agent, someone snuck around found things out. He'd good since teenager, even Hogwarts reputation finding sorts secrets. So conspiracy theory Pettigrew became unregistered Animagus still Hogwarts, Animagus something small could scurry around listen conversations. The main problem successful Animagi rare teenager would really unlikely, course conspiracy theory says father Black unregistered Animagi too. And conspiracy theory, Pettigrew killed twelve bystanders, turned small Animagus form, ran. So Michael Shermer says four additional problems this. One, Black one knew parents were." (Harry's voice little hard said that.) "Two, Black likely suspect start Pettigrew, there's rumor Black deliberately tried get student killed time Hogwarts, really nasty pureblood family, Bellatrix Black literally cousin. Three, Black twenty times fighting wizard Pettigrew was, even smart. The duel would like Professor Quirrell versus Professor Sprout. Pettigrew probably even get chance draw wand, let alone fake evidence conspiracy theory requires. And four, Black standing street laughing."  "But rat -" said Hermione.  "Right," Harry said. "Well, make long story short, Bill Weasley decided little brother Percy's pet rat Pettigrew's Animagus form -"  Hermione's jaw dropped.  "Yes," Harry said, "you exactly expect Evil Pettigrew living sad furtive life pet rat enemy wizarding family, he'd either Malfoys or, likely, Carribean bit plastic surgery. Anyway, Bill knocks little brother Percy, stuns grabs rat, sends emergency owl messages -"  "Oh, no!" Hermione said, words torn her.  "- somehow manages gather Dumbledore, Minister Magic, Head Auror -"  "He didn't!" said Hermione.  "And course get think he's crazy, use Veritas Oculum rat anyway, sure, discover?"  She would've died. "A rat."  "You win cookie! So dragged poor Bill Weasley St. Mungo's turned pretty standard schizophrenic break, happens people, especially young men around we'd consider college age. Guy convinced ninety-seven years old died gone back time younger self via train station. And responded perfectly well antipsychotics back normal everything's fine now, except people talk much anymore Sirius Black conspiracy theories, ever ask Weasleys family rat."  Hermione giggling helplessly. It really awful laughing terrible person.  "The thing I understand," Harry said, giggles died down, "is Black would hunt Pettigrew instead running fast could. He know Aurors would him. I wonder got reason Black took Azkaban? See, people absolutely positively guilty still go legal system get trials."  Hermione agree that.  Soon Harry done book Hermione halfway - much difficult book Harry's, still felt embarrassed that. And put Magical Mnemonics back shelf drag away, time face dreaded class Hogwarts, BROOMSTICK RIDING.  Harry tagged along walked there, even though class hour half later, like fighter jet escorting sad little propeller plane way funeral.  The boy wished goodbye quiet, sympathetic voice, walked onto grassy fields Doom.  And much shrieking almost falling horrible brushes death ground completely wrong place sun getting eyes Morag buzzing Mandy thinking subtle always near enough catch fell knew students laughing never said anything Mandy actually want die.  After ten million years class ended, back ground belonged next Thursday. Sometimes nightmares always Thursday.  Why everyone learn this, going Apparate Floo portkey everywhere grew up, complete utter mystery Hermione. Nobody actually needed ride broomsticks adult, like forced play dodgeball P.E.  At least Harry decency ashamed good it.   It couple hours later, Hufflepuff study hall Hannah, Susan, Leanne, Megan. Professor Flitwick, surprisingly diffident teacher, asked might possibly maybe help four Charms homework while, even though Ravenclaws, Hermione felt proud she'd almost burst.  Hermione took piece parchment, spilled little bit ink it, tore four pieces, crumpled them, tossed pieces table.  She could gotten crumpling it, made like garbage, helped someone first practicing Disposal Charm.  Hermione sharpened ears eyes, said, "Okay, try it."  "Everto."  "Everto."  "Everto."  "Everto."  Hermione think she'd quite caught problems. "Can try again?"  An hour later Hermione concluded (1), Leanne Megan sort sloppy, asked keep practicing something, would, (2) Hannah Susan focused driven point keep telling slow relax think things instead trying hard - odd think two would soon - (3) liked helping Hufflepuffs, whole study hall cheerful atmosphere.  When left dinner, found Boy-Who-Lived reading book waited escort her. It made feel flattered, also little worried Harry seem really talk anyone besides her.  "Did know there's girl Hufflepuff who's Metamorphmagus?" said Hermione headed toward Great Hall. "She makes hair really red, like stopsign red Weasley red, spilled hot tea turned black-haired boy got control again."  "Really? Cool," said Harry, sounding bit distracted. "Um, Hermione, check, know tomorrow last day sign Professor Quirrell's armies, right?"  "Yes," Hermione said. "The armies evil Professor Quirrell." Her voice little angry, though Harry know why, course.  "Hermione," Harry said, voice exasperated, "he's evil. He's little bit Dark whole lot Slytherin. It's evil."  Harry Potter many words things, problem. He would better he'd divided universe Good Bad. "Professor Quirrell called front whole class told shoot someone!"  "He right," Harry said, face sober. "I'm sorry, Hermione, was. You shot me, I minded. You can't learn Battle Magic can't practice real opponents using real spells. And okay sparring, you?"  Hermione twelve, knew, put words, find thing say would convince Harry.  Professor Quirrell taken young girl called girl front everyone, ordered open fire without provocation classmate.  It matter Professor Quirrell right needing learn it.  Professor McGonagall ever done that.  Professor Flitwick ever done that.  Maybe even Professor Snape would done that.  Professor Quirrell EVIL.  But find words, knew Harry would never believe her.  "Hermione, I've talked older students," Harry said. "Professor Quirrell could competent Defense Professor get seven years Hogwarts. Anything else learn later. If want study Defense, year. The students sign extracurricular stuff going learning huge amounts, way beyond Ministry thinks first-years supposed study - know we're going learning Patronus Charm? In January?"  "The Patronus Charm?" Hermione said, voice going surprise.  Her books said one brightest magics known, weapon Darkest creatures, cast pure positive emotions. It something she'd expect evil Professor Quirrell teach - arrange taught, since Hermione imagine could spell himself.  "Yes," Harry said. "Students usually learn Patronus Charm fifth years even later! But Professor Quirrell says Ministry schedules made talking Flobberworms, ability cast Patronus Charm depends emotions magical strength. Professor Quirrell says thinks students way less can, year he's going prove it."  There usual tone awed worship Harry's voice talked Professor Quirrell, Hermione gritted teeth kept walking.  "I already signed up, actually," Hermione said, voice little quiet. "I morning. For everything, like said."  In penny, pound usual expression.  Besides, want lose, wanted win learn.  "So armies, then?" Harry's voice suddenly enthusiastic. "That's awesome, Hermione! I've already gotten list soldiers, I'm sure Professor Quirrell let add one more, trade -"  "I'm joining army." Hermione's voice sharp. She knew reasonable assumption still annoyed her.  Harry blinked. "Not Draco Malfoy's, surely. So want third army? Even though know general yet?" Harry sounded surprised little wounded, blame him, though course blame him, since fact fault. "But mine?"  "Think it," Hermione snapped, "and maybe work out!"  And sped stride left Harry gaping behind her.   "Professor Quirrell," Draco said formal voice, "I must protest appointment Hermione Granger third general."  "Oh?" said Professor Quirrell, leaning back chair casual relaxed manner. "Protest away, Mr. Malfoy."  "Granger unfit position," said Draco.  Professor Quirrell tapped finger cheek thoughtfully. "Why yes, yes is. Do protests?"  "Professor Quirrell," said Harry Potter beside him, "with due respect Miss Granger's many outstanding academic talents Quirrell points justly earned classes, personality suited military command."  Draco relieved Harry agreed accompany Professor Quirrell's office. It Harry gigantic blatant teacher's pet Professor Quirrell concerned. Draco also started worry Harry actually friends Granger, still made move... like it.  "I agree Mr. Potter," said Draco. "Appointing general turns farce."  "Harshly put," said Harry, "but I cannot bring disagree Mr. Malfoy. To blunt, Professor Quirrell, Hermione Granger around much intent kill bowl wet grapes."  "That," said Professor Quirrell mildly, "is thing I would fail notice myself. You telling nothing I already know."  It Draco's turn say something, conversation suddenly hiccupped. That answer possibilities Harry brainstormed coming here. What say teacher said knew everything knew still going commit obvious mistake?  The silence stretched.  "Is sort plot?" Harry said slowly.  "Must everything I sort plot?" said Professor Quirrell. "Can't I ever create chaos sake chaos?"  Draco almost choked.  "Not Battle Magic class," Harry said calm certainty. "Other places, maybe, there."  Professor Quirrell slowly raised eyebrows.  Harry gazed steadily back him.  Draco shivered.  "Well then," Professor Quirrell said. "Neither seem considered simple question. Who could I appoint instead Miss Granger?"  "Blaise Zabini," Draco said without hesitation.  "Any suggestions?" said Professor Quirrell, sounding quite amused.  Anthony Goldstein Ernie Macmillan, came thought, Draco's common sense kicked ruled mudbloods Hufflepuffs matter aggressively dueled. So instead Draco said, "What's wrong Zabini?"  "I see..." Harry said slowly.  "I don't," said Draco. "Why Zabini?"  Professor Quirrell looked Draco. "Because, Mr. Malfoy, matter hard tries, he'll never able keep Mr. Potter."  The shock staggered Draco. "You can't believe Granger going -"  "He's gambling her," Harry said quietly. "It's guaranteed. The odds even good. She'll probably never give us good fight, even does, may take months learn. But one year chance growing beat us."  Draco's hands twitched clench fists. Showing supporter backing classic undermining tactic, Harry Potter Granger implied -  "But Professor," Harry went smoothly, "I'm worried Hermione miserable general army. I'm speaking friend now, Professor Quirrell. The competition might good Draco me, asking good her!"  Never mind.  "Your friendship Hermione Granger credit," Professor Quirrell said dryly. "Especially able friends Draco Malfoy time. Quite feat, that."  Harry suddenly looked little nervous, meaning probably felt lot nervous, Draco silently swore himself. Of course Harry going fool Professor Quirrell.  "And I doubt Miss Granger would appreciate friendly concern," said Professor Quirrell. "She asked position, Mr. Potter, I ask her."  Harry quiet moment. Then flashed Draco quick look mixed apology warning, saying time, Sorry, I best We'd better press further.  "As miserable," Professor Quirrell went on, slight smile playing lips, "I suspect much easier time rigors position either suspect, put good fight much sooner think."  Harry Draco gasped horror.  "You're going advise her, you?" said Draco, utterly aghast.  "I never signed fight you!" said Harry.  The smile playing around Professor Quirrell's lips grew wider. "As matter fact, I offer share suggestions regarding Miss Granger's first battles."  "Professor Quirrell!" said Harry.  "Oh, worry," Professor Quirrell said. "She turned down. Just I expected."  Draco's eyes narrowed.  "Dear me, Mr. Potter," said Professor Quirrell, "didn't anyone ever tell rude stare?"  "You're going secretly help way, you?" said Harry.  "Would I that?" said Professor Quirrell.  "Yes," said Draco Harry time.  "I wounded lack trust. Well then, I promise help General Granger way two know about. And I suggest military affairs. November approaches, swiftly."   Draco saw implications door closed way behind way Professor Quirrell's office.  Harry spoken dismissively "people stuff".  And Draco's hope.  Let realize, let realize...  "We attack Granger girl first get way," said Draco. "After crush her, contest without distractions."  "Now really seem fair her, it?" said Harry mild voice.  "What care?" said Draco. "She's rival, right?" Then, right note suspicion voice, "Don't tell started really liking her, rival time..."  "Founders forbid," said Harry. "What I say, Draco? I merely natural sense justice. Granger too, know. She firm grasp good evil, probably going attack evil first. Having name like 'Malfoy' asking it, know."  DAMN IT!  "Harry," said Draco, sounding wounded maybe little superior, "don't want fight fairly me?"  "You mean rather attacking already lost forces beating Granger?" said Harry. "Oh, I know. Maybe I get bored winning I'll try 'fair' thing."  "Maybe she'll attack you," Draco said. "You're rival."  "But I'm friendly rival," Harry said evil grin. "I bought nice birthday present everything. You go around sabotaging friendly rival like that."  "What sabotaging friend's chance fair fight?" said Draco angrily. "I thought friends!"  "Let rephrase that," said Harry. "Granger sabotage friendly rival. But that's killing intention bowl wet grapes. You would. You totally would. And guess what, would I."  DAMN IT!   If play, would dramatic music.  The hero, impeccably turned green-trimmed robes perfectly combed white-blonde hair, faced villain.  The villain, leaning back simple wooden chair buckteeth clearly visible stray chestnut curls drifting cheeks, faced hero.  It Wednesday, October 30th, first battle coming Sunday.  Draco standing General Granger's office, room size small classroom. (Why general's office large, Draco quite sure. A chair desk would worked him. He even clear generals needed offices all, soldiers knew find him. Unless Professor Quirrell deliberately arranged huge offices sign status, case Draco it.)  Granger sat room's single chair like throne, way end office door opened. There long oblong table stretched across middle room them, four small circular tables scattered around corners, one single chair, way opposite end. The room windows along one wall, one beam sunlight touched top Granger's hair like glowing crown.  It would nice Draco could walked slowly forward. But table way, Draco go around diagonally, good way dramatic dignified fashion. Had deliberate? If father, surely would been; Granger, surely not.  There nowhere sit, Granger stood up, either.  Draco kept outrage entirely face.  "Well, Mr. Draco Malfoy," Granger said stood her, "you requested audience I gracious grant it. What plea?"  Come visit Malfoy Manor, father I would like show interesting spells.     "Your rival, Potter, came offer," said Draco, putting serious look face. "He mind losing me, would humiliated won. So wants join wipe immediately, first battle, them. If I that, Potter wants hold back harass you, launches all-out attack first move."  "I see," Granger said, looking surprised. "And offering help him?"  "Of course," said Draco smoothly. "I think wanted to fair."  "Why, that's nice you, Mr. Malfoy," said Granger. "I'm sorry I spoke earlier. We friends. Can I call Drakey?"  Alarm bells started sound Draco's head, chance meant it...  "Of course," said Draco, "if I call Hermy."  Draco pretty sure saw expression flicker.  "Anyway," Draco said, "I thinking would serve Potter right attacked wiped out."  "But fair Mr. Potter, would it?" said Granger.  "I think it'd fair," Draco said. "He planning to first."  Granger giving stern look could possibly intimidated he'd Hufflepuff instead Malfoy. "You think I'm pretty stupid, you, Mr. Malfoy?"  Draco smiled charmingly. "No, Miss Granger, I thought I'd least check. So, want?"  "Are offering bribe me?" said Granger.  "Sure," said Draco. "Can I slip Galleon beat Potter instead rest year?"  "Nope," said Granger, "but offer ten Galleons attack equally, instead you."  "Ten Galleons lot money," Draco said cautiously.  "I know Malfoys poor," said Granger.  Draco stared Granger.  He starting get strange feeling this.  That particular reply seem like come particular girl.  "Well," said Draco, "you get rich wasting money, know."  "I know know dentist is, Mr. Malfoy, parents dentists anything less ten Galleons worth time all."  "Three Galleons," Draco said, probe anything else.  "Nope," said Granger. "If want equal fight all, I believe Malfoy wants equal fight less wants ten Galleons."  Draco starting get strange feeling this.  "No," said Draco.  "No?" said Granger. "This limited time offer, Mr. Malfoy. Are sure want risk whole year miserably crushed Boy-Who-Lived? That would pretty embarrassing House Malfoy, it?"  It persuasive argument, one hard refuse, get rich spending money heart told setup.  "No," said Draco.  "See Sunday," said Granger.  Draco turned walked office without another word.  That right...   "Hermione," Harry said patiently, "we're supposed plotting other. You could even betray mean anything outside battlefield."  Hermione shook head. "It nice, Harry."  Harry sighed. "I think getting spirit all."  It nice. She'd actually said that. Hermione know whether insulted Harry thought her, worried whether really sound like much goody-two-shoes usually.  It probably time change subject.  "Anyway, anything special tomorrow?" said Hermione. "It's -"  Her voice cut abruptly realized.  "Yes, Hermione," Harry said little tightly, "what day it?"   Interlude:  There time October 31st called Halloween magical Britain.  Now Harry Potter Day.  Harry turned offers, even one Minister Fudge might good future political favors really gritted teeth taken. But Harry, October 31st would always The Dark Lord Killed My Parents Day. There quiet, dignified memorial service somewhere, one, invited.  Hogwarts got day celebrate. Even Slytherins dare wear black outside dorm. There special events special foods teachers looked way anyone ran hallways. It tenth anniversary, all.  Harry spent day trunk spoil anyone else, eating snack bars place meals, reading sadder science fiction books (no fantasy), writing letter Mum Dad much longer ones usually sent.   Chapter 30: Working Groups, Pt 1  J. K. Rowling man tries bother you, think blue, count two, look red shoe.   The day Sunday, November 3rd, soon three great powers school year, Harry Potter, Draco Malfoy, Hermione Granger, would begin struggle supreme dominance.  (Harry slightly annoyed way Boy-Who-Lived demoted supreme dominance one three equal rivals entering contest, expected get back soon.)  The battleground section non-Forbidden forest, dense trees, Professor Quirrell thought able see enemy forces boring even first battle.  All students actually first-year army camped nearby watching screens Professor Quirrell set up. Except three Gryffindors fourth year, currently sick confined healer's beds Madam Pomfrey. Aside that, everyone there.  The students dressed, ordinary school robes, Muggle camouflage uniforms Professor Quirrell obtained somewhere supplied sufficient quantity variety fit everyone. It students would worried stains rips, Charms for. But Professor Quirrell explained surprised wizardborns, nice dignified clothing efficient hiding forests dodging around trees.  And uniform's breast, patch bearing name insignia army. A small patch. If wanted soldiers wear, say, colored ribbons could identify distance, risk enemy getting hands ribbons, you.  Harry tried get name Dragon Army.  Draco pitched fit said would confuse everyone completely.  Professor Quirrell ruled Draco could lay prior claim name, wished.  So Harry fighting Dragon Army.  This probably good sign.  For insignia, instead too-obvious dragon's head breathing fire, Draco elected simply go fire. Elegant, understated, deadly: This what's left we've passed. Very Malfoy.  Harry, considering alternate choices 501st Provisional Battalion Harry's Minions o' Doom, decided army would known simple dignified appellation Chaos Legion.  Their insignia hand poised fingers ready snap.  It universally agreed good sign.  Harry earnestly advised Hermione young boys serving probably nervous girl reputation nice, pick something scary would reassure toughness make proud part army, like Blood Commandos something.  Hermione named army Sunshine Regiment.  Their insignia smiley face.  And ten minutes, would war.  Harry stood bright forest clearing assigned starting location, area open space old rotting tree stumps cleared away unknown purpose, ground coated small scattering blown leaves dried grey remnants grass failed test summer's heat, sun shining brilliantly above.  Around twenty-three soldiers Professor Quirrell assigned him. Nearly Gryffindor signed up, course, half Slytherin, less half Hufflepuff, handful Ravenclaw. In Harry's army twelve Gryffindors six Slytherins four Hufflepuffs one Ravenclaw besides himself... way tell looking uniforms. No red, green, yellow, blue. Just Muggle camouflage patterns, patch breast device hand poised snap fingers.  Harry looked upon twenty-three soldiers, wearing uniforms marks group identity save single patch.  And lo, Harry smiled, understood part Professor Quirrell's master plan about; Harry taking full advantage purposes, too.  There legendary episode social psychology called Robbers Cave experiment. It set bewildered aftermath World War II, intent investigating causes remedies conflicts groups. The scientists set summer camp 22 boys 22 different schools, selecting stable middle-class families. The first phase experiment intended investigate took start conflict groups. The 22 boys divided two groups 11 -  - quite sufficient.  The hostility started moment two groups become aware others' existences state park, insults hurled first meeting. They'd named Eagles Rattlers (they needed names thought ones park) proceeded develop contrasting group stereotypes, Rattlers thinking rough-and-tough swearing heavily, Eagles correspondingly deciding think upright-and-proper.  The part experiment testing resolve group conflicts. Bringing boys together watch fireworks worked all. They'd shouted stayed apart. What worked warning might vandals park, two groups needing work together solve failure park's water system. A common task, common enemy.  Harry strong suspicion Professor Quirrell understood principle well indeed chosen create three armies per year.  Three armies.  Not four.  And definitely segregated House... except Slytherins assigned Draco besides Mr. Crabbe Mr. Goyle.  It things like reassured Harry Professor Quirrell, despite affected Dark atmosphere pretense neutrality conflict Good Evil, secretly backing Good, Harry would ever dare say loud.  And Harry decided take full advantage Professor Quirrell's plan define group identity way.  The Rattlers, they'd met Eagles, started thinking rough-and-tough, they'd conducted accordingly.  The Eagles thought good-and-proper.  And bright forest clearing, scattered around old rotting tree stumps, outlined sun shining brilliantly above, General Potter twenty-three soldiers arranged nothing remotely resembling formation. Some soldiers stood, soldiers sat, stood one leg different.  It Chaos Legion, all.  And reason stand neat little lines, Harry said disdainfully, going neat little lines.  Harry divided army 6 squads 4 soldiers each, squad commanded Squad Suggester. All troops strict orders disobey orders given seemed like good idea time, including one... unless Harry Squad Suggester prefixed order "Merlin says", case supposed actually obey.  The Chaos Legion's chief attack split run multiple directions, randomly changing vectors firing approved sleep spell rapidly could rebuild magical strength. And saw chance distract confuse enemy, took it.  Fast. Creative. Unpredictable. Non-homogenous. Don't obey orders, think whether right makes sense.  Harry quite sure he'd pretended optimum military efficiency... he'd given golden opportunity change students thought themselves, intended use it.  Five minutes wartime, according Harry's watch.  General Potter walked (not marched) air force waiting tensely, broomsticks already clutched firmly hands.  "All wings report in," said General Potter. They'd rehearsed one training session Saturday.  "Red Leader standing by," said Seamus Finnigan, idea meant.  "Red Five standing by," said Dean Thomas, who'd waited entire life say it.  "Green Leader standing by," Theodore Nott said rather stiffly.  "Green Forty-One standing by," Tracey Davis said.  "I want air instant hear bell," said General Potter. "Do engage, repeat, engage. Evade fire." (Of course aim sleep spells broomsticks; fired spell gave temporary red glow whatever hit. If hit broomstick rider, war.) "Red Leader Red Five, fly toward Malfoy's army fast can, stay high still seeing them, return instant know sure they're doing. Green Leader, Granger's army. Green Forty-One, fly us watch approaching broomsticks soldiers, authorized fire. And remember, I say 'Merlin says' that, really need information. For Chaos!"  "For Chaos!" four echoed varying degrees enthusiasm.  Harry expected Hermione launch immediate attack Draco, case he'd move troops position start supporting her, she'd taken severe losses caused damage. He would frame heroic rescue, possible; Sunshine thinking Chaos friend, all.  But case didn't... well, Chaos Legion staying put Green Leader reported back.  Draco's moves would self-interest. He would predictably ready army defend Hermione; might might realize Harry lying waiting attack battle finished. Harry still put two broomsticks Dragon Army, case something, case Draco Mr. Goyle Mr. Crabbe good enough shoot broomstick sky.  But General Granger unpredictable one, Harry move knew moving.   In heart forest, shadow patterns dancing ground leafy canopies swayed high above, General Malfoy stood trees relatively sparser, looked troops calm satisfaction. Six units three troops each, Aerial Unit four (to Gregory assigned), Command Unit, Vincent. They'd drilled short time previous Saturday, Draco confident he'd managed explain basics. Stay mates, watch back trust watch yours. Move single body. Obey orders show fear. Aim, fire, move, aim again, fire again.  The six units formed defensive perimeter around Draco, watchfully gazing outward forest. Back-to-back stood, wands gripped low needed strike.  They already looked remarkably like Auror units whose training Draco watched father's inspections.  Chaos Sunshine going know hit them.  "Attention," said General Malfoy.  The six units unfolded spun toward Draco; faces broomstick riders turned stood broomsticks already hand.  Draco decided wait demanding salutes first battle, Gryffindors Hufflepuffs would willing salute Malfoy.  But soldiers already standing straight enough, especially Gryffindors, Draco wondered he'd even needed delay. Gregory quietly listened, reported back Draco's volunteering stand Harry Potter Defense class, time Professor Quirrell taught Harry lose, marked Draco acceptable commander. At least happened assigned army. Not Slytherins alike; Slytherins, Slytherins Gryffindors Draco's army quoting Housemates.  Draco frankly astounded incredibly easy been. Draco protested first assigned Slytherins, Professor Quirrell told wanted first Malfoy gain complete political control country, needed learn govern three-quarters population. It things like reassured Draco Professor Quirrell great deal sympathy good guys Professor Quirrell letting on.  The actual battle easy, especially Granger attack Dragons first. Draco agonized whether commit forces Granger immediately preemptive strike, worried (1) Harry misleading completely Granger likely do, (2) Harry misleading waiting Granger's attack join battle.  Though Dragon Army secret weapon, three fact, might enough win even attacked armies once...  It almost time, meant time pre-battle speech Draco composed memorized.  "The battle begin," Draco said. His voice calm precise. "Remember everything I Mr. Crabbe Mr. Goyle showed you. An army wins disciplined deadly. General Potter Chaos Legion disciplined. Granger Sunshine Regiment deadly. We disciplined, deadly, Dragons. The battle begin, win it."   (Ex tempore speech given General Potter Chaos Legion, immediately first battle, November 3rd, 1991, 2:56pm:)  My troops, I'm going lie you, situation today grim. Dragon Army never lost single battle. And Hermione Granger... good memory. The truth is, probably going die. And survivors envy dead. But win this. We win someday, children enjoy taste chocolate again. Everything stake here. Literally everything. If lose, whole universe blinks like light bulb. And I realize know light bulb is. Well, take me, bad. But go down, let's go fighting, like heroes, darkness closes in, think ourselves, least fun. Are afraid die? I know I am. I feel cold shivers fear like someone pumping ice cream shirt. But I know... history watching us. It watching us changed uniforms. It probably taking pictures. And history, troops, written victors. If win this, write history. A history Hogwarts founded four renegade house elves. We make everyone study history, even though true, answer right way tests... they'll fail class. Isn't worth dying for? No, answer that. Some things better left unknown. None us know we're here. None us know we're fighting. We woke uniforms mysterious forest, knowing way get names memories back except victory. The students armies there... they're like us. They want die. They're fighting protect other, friends left. They're fighting know families who'll miss them, even can't remember now. They may even fighting save world. But better reason fight do. We fight like it. We fight amuse eldritch monstrosities beyond Space Time. We fight we're Chaos. Soon final battle begin, let say now, I get chance later, honor commander, however briefly. Thank you, thank all. And remember, goal cut enemy, make afraid.   A great booming gong echoed forest.  And Sunshine Regiment began march.   The tension rose rose, Harry nineteen soldiers remained waited aerial warriors report back. It take long, broomsticks fast distances forest great -  Two broomsticks approached, speed, direction Draco's camp, soldiers tensed. They executing maneuvers today's code friendly broomstick.  "Scatter fire!" roared General Potter, suited action words, scurrying top speed toward forest cover; soon Harry among trees, spun back, raised wand, tried seek broomstick sky -  "Clear!" shouted voice. "They're heading back!"  Harry gave mental shrug. There'd way prevent Draco obtaining information, he'd learn they'd standing still.  And Chaotics slowly emerged forest -  "Broomstick approaching Granger's direction!" yelled another voice. "I think Green Leader, dip roll!"  Moments later Theodore Nott dived sky pulled midst soldiers.  "Granger divided forces two!" yelled Nott hovered broomstick. There sweat staining uniform, reserve gone voice. "She's attacking armies! Two brooms covering force, pursued halfway here!"  Divided army, Earth -  A large force concentrating fire small force could deplete force rapidly without taking much damage return. If twenty soldiers faced ten soldiers, twenty sleep spells would aimed ten soldiers ten sleep spells going way, unless every one first sleep spells hit target, smaller force would lose people could manage take them. Defeated detail military term happened divided forces like that. What could Hermione possibly thinking...  Then Harry realized.  She's fair.  It going long year Defense class.  "All right," Harry said loudly, army could hear. "We'll wait Red Wing reports in, we'll go cloud Sunshine."   Draco listened flyers' reports face calm, shock concealed inside. What could Granger possibly thinking?  Then Draco realized.  It's feint.  One Sunshine's two forces would change direction, would converge on... who?   Neville Longbottom marched forest toward approaching Sunny force, occasionally glancing sky broomsticks. Beside marched squad comrades, Melvin Coote Lavender Brown Gryffindor, Allen Flint Slytherin. Allen Flint Squad Suggester, though Harry first said Neville, private, position wanted it.  Harry said quite lot things Neville private, starting "You know, Neville, want become awesome imaginary Neville lives head allowed anything scared, really sign Professor Quirrell's armies."  Neville sure Boy-Who-Lived could read minds. There way Harry Potter could've known. Neville never talked anyone, given sign; people like that, Neville ever noticed.  And Harry's promise come true, feel different sparring Defense class. Neville hoped sparring would fix everything wrong him, and, well, hadn't. Even could fire spells another student class Professor Quirrell watching make sure nothing went wrong, even could dodge fire back allowed everyone else expecting would stare funny it, none able stand himself.  But part army...  Something strange stirring inside Neville, marched forest alongside comrades, upon uniforms insignia fingers poised snap.  He allowed walk wanted to, felt like marching.  Beside him, Melvin Lavender Allen seemed feel like marching too.  And Neville softly began sing Song Chaos.  The tune Muggle would identified John Williams's Imperial March, also known "Darth Vader's Theme"; words Harry added easy remember.  Doom doom doom   Doom doom doom doom doom doom   Doom doom doom   Doom doom doom doom doom doom   DOOM doom DOOM   Doom doom doom-doom-doom doom doom   Doom doom-doom-doom doom doom   Doom doom doom, doom doom doom.  By second line others joined in, soon could hear soft chant coming nearby parts forest.  And Neville marched alongside fellow Chaos Legionnaires,   strange feelings stirring heart,   imagination becoming reality,   lips poured fearful song doom.   Harry stared bodies scattered across forest. Something inside felt bit queasy, remind hard sleeping. There girls among fallen, made lot worse somehow, would careful never mention front Hermione Aurors would find remains stuffed small teapot.  Half Sunshine army put much fight Chaos. The nine ground soldiers run screaming inarticulately Simple Shields raised, circular screens protect faces chests. But fire hold shield time, Harry's soldiers simply aimed legs. All one Sunnies fallen soon cries "Somnium!" filled air. That last one dropped shield managed take one Harry's soldiers hit second wave sleep spells (the Sleep Hex safe multiple hits). The two Sunny broomsticks much harder take accounted three Chaotics auraed massed ground fire.  Hermione among fallen. Draco must gotten making Harry feel angry completely incomprehensible level, sure feeling protective toward Hermione, cheated one it, maybe both.  "All right," Harry said, raising voice. "Let's everyone clear one thing, real fight. That General Granger making mistake first battle. Today's actual fight Dragon Army going anything like this. It's going lot fun. Let's move out."   A broomstick fell sky, approaching terrifyingly fast, spun end decelerated hard could almost hear air screaming protest, came halt directly beside Draco.  It dangerous showing-off. Gregory Goyle simply good waste time.  "Potter's coming," Gregory said trace usual fake drawl. "They've still got four brooms, want take out?"  "No," Draco said sharply. "Fighting army gives much advantage, they'll fire ground even might able dodge all. Wait forces engage."  Draco lost four Dragons exchange twelve Sunnies. Apparently General Granger actually incredibly stupid, though among attackers, Draco gotten chance taunt ask Merlin's name thinking.  The true battle, knew, would Harry Potter.  "Prepare yourselves!" roared Draco troops. "Stay together mates, act unit, fire soon enemy range!"  Discipline Chaos.  It much fight.   The adrenaline pumping pumping Neville's blood felt like could hardly breathe.  "We're closing in," said General Potter voice barely loud enough carry whole army. "Time spread out."  Neville's comrades moved away him. They would still support other, clustered together, enemy would much easier time hitting you; fire aimed one comrades might miss get instead. You would lot harder hit spread moved fast could.  The first thing General Potter done, training session, get fire sides running fast, stood still took time aim, one moving one standing still - reverse charm Sleep Hex simple, though allowed use real battles. General Potter carefully recorded everything happened, done figuring ciphering, announced made sense focus, slowing aim carefully, moving fast get hit.  It still bothered Neville little marching side-by-side comrades, scary battlecries they'd learned already thundering head made lot.  This time, Neville silently vowed himself, voice absolutely positively going squeak.  "Shields up," said General Potter, "power forward deflectors."  "Contego," murmured army, circular screens sprang existence heads chests.  A sharp taste filled Neville's mouth. General Potter ordered cast shields unless almost range. Neville could see uniformed shapes Dragons moving dense screens trees, Dragons would seeing well -  "Attack!" came cry distance, voice Draco Malfoy, General Potter bellowed, "Charge -"  All adrenaline Neville's blood unleashed, legs took over, sending flying faster he'd ever run before, straight toward enemy, knowing without needing look comrades same.  "Blood blood god!" screamed Neville. "Skulls skull throne! Ia! Shub-Niggurath! The enemy's gate sideways!"  There soundless impact sleep spell wasted Neville's shield. If there'd spells fired, hit.  Neville saw brief look fear Wayne Hopkins's face, stood besides two Gryffindors Neville recognize, -  - Neville dropped Simple Shield fired Wayne -  - missed -  - racing legs went straight past enemy grouping toward another three Dragons, wands coming him, mouths opening -  - even thinking it, Neville dived forest floor three voices cried "Somnium!"  It hurt, hard stones hard twigs digging Neville rolled, bad falling broomstick he'd still hit ground pretty hard, Neville, sudden insight, lay still closed eyes.  "Stop that!" screamed voice. "Don't shoot us, we're Dragons!"  With flash glorious satisfaction, Neville realized he'd managed get two groups Dragons one group fired him. Harry talked tactic making enemy afraid fire, apparently worked bit better that.  And that, Dragons believed they'd gotten him, since they'd seen Neville fall fired.  Neville counted twenty inside head, opened eyes crack.  The three Dragons near him, heads spinning rapidly cries "Somnium!" "Skulls skull throne!" filled air around them. All three Simple Shields now.  Neville's wand still hand, take much effort point one boy's boots whisper "Somnium."  Neville quickly closed eyes relaxed hand heard boy fall ground.  "Where'd come from?" screamed Justin Finch-Fletchley's voice, Neville heard rustles leafy forest floor, two Dragons spinning around looking enemy.  "Reform ranks!" bellowed Malfoy's voice. "To me, everyone, let scatter you!"  Neville's ears heard two Dragons actually jump prone body ran off.  Neville opened eyes, pushed feet bit painfully, pointed wand said new charm General Potter taught all. They real illusion spells confuse enemy, even age could -  "Ventriliquo," whispered Neville, pointing wand one side Justin boy, yelled, "For Cthulhu glory!"  Justin boy stopped abruptly, turning shields toward Neville moved battlecry, multiple cries "Somnium!" filled air boy dropped Neville finished aiming.  "The last one's mine!" yelled Neville, started sprinting straight toward Justin, who'd mean older Hufflepuffs straightened out. Neville surrounded comrades meant -  "Special attack, Chaotic Leap!" howled Neville ran, felt body lighten, lighten twice again, comrades got wands turned toward quietly cast Hover Charm, Neville raised left hand snapped fingers used legs push ground hard could soared air. Sheer shock painted Justin's face Neville went boy's shield pointed wand form passing beneath cried "Somnium!"  Because he'd felt like it, why.  Neville quite get feet turned around properly rather plowed ground landed, two three Chaos Legionnaires managed hold wands throughout hit hard.  And Neville got feet, panting. He knew moving, people yelling "Somnium!" place -  "I Neville, last scion Longbottom!" screamed Neville sky above, holding wand pointed straight though challenge blazing blue heaven itself, knowing nothing day would ever again. "Neville Chaos! Face da-"  (When Neville woke afterward, told Dragon Army taken cue counterattack.)   The girl beside Harry slumped ground, taking shot meant him, could hear Mr. Goyle's distant gloating laugh broomstick blasted past them, cutting air hard shattered wake.  "Luminos!" cried one boys next Harry, able rebuild magical strength fast enough earlier, Mr. Goyle dodged without pause.  Chaos six soldiers left, now, Dragon Army two, problem one soldiers invincible, one using three soldiers cover inside shield.  They'd lost soldiers Mr. Goyle Dragons put together, weaving dodging air fast one could hit him, could shoot people that.  Harry thought sorts ways stop Mr. Goyle none safe, even using Hover Charm slow (it continuous beam much easier aim) safe might fall broomstick, throwing things way safe, getting harder harder remember Harry's blood froze over.  It's game. You're trying kill him. Don't throw away future plans game...  Harry could see pattern, could see Mr. Goyle weaving, could see needed fire order create web shots Mr. Goyle able dodge, able explain fast enough soldiers, coordinate shots well enough, enough people left -  I refuse lose, like this, whole army one soldier!  Mr. Goyle's broomstick turned faster anything able turn started angle toward Harry surviving troops, could sense boy beside tensing, getting ready throw front general.  SCREW THIS.  Harry's wand came up, focusing Mr. Goyle, Harry's mind visualized pattern, Harry's lips opened voice screamed -  "Luminosluminosluminosluminosluminosluminosluminosluminosluminosluminosluminosluminos-"      When Harry's eyes opened again, found resting comfortable position hands folded chest, holding wand like fallen hero.  Slowly, Harry sat up. His magic aching, strange sensation entirely unpleasant one, much like burn lethargy followed hard physical exercise.  "The general's awake!" cried voice, Harry blinked focused direction.  Four soldiers held wands shimmering prismatic hemisphere, Harry realized battle over. Right... hit Sleep Hex, exhausted himself, woke up, still game.  Harry suspected going get lecture someone-or-other exhausting magic point unconsciousness children's game. But hurt Mr. Goyle he'd lost temper, important thing.  Then Harry's mind clicked another implication, looked steel ring left hand's pinky finger, almost swore loud saw tiny diamond missing marshmallow lying ground near he'd fallen.  He'd sustained Transfiguration seventeen days, would need start over.  Could've worse. He could've done fourteen days later, Professor McGonagall approved Transfigure father's rock. That one good lesson learn easy way.  Note self: Always remove ring finger completely exhausting magic.  Harry pushed up, making rather hard going it. Using magic exhaust muscles, dodging around trees certainly did.  He staggered iridescent hemisphere contained Draco Malfoy, holding wand aloft sustain shield, smiling coldly Harry.  "Where's fifth soldier?" said Harry.  "Um..." said boy whose name Harry remember moment. "I fired Sleep Hex shield bounced hit Lavender, I mean angle right did..."  Draco smirking inside shield.  "So let guess," Harry said, looking Draco directly eyes, "those neat little trios formation used professional magical militaries? Made trained soldiers easily hit moving targets hands steady, combine defensive powers long stay together? Unlike soldiers?"  The smirk vanished Draco's face, hard grim.  "You know," Harry said lightly, knowing none others would understand real message passing them, "it goes show always question everything see role models doing, ask done, whether makes sense context too. Don't forget apply advice real life, way. And thanks slow-moving clustered targets."  Because Draco already gotten lecture, and, Harry suspected, discounted suspicion Harry trying shift loyalties away pureblood tradition. Which course Harry was. But example would make excellent excuse, next Saturday, claim questioning authority merely practical technique real life. And Harry would also mention experiments he'd run, first individuals groups, check ideas importance speed actually correct, way hammering home point Draco needing keep eye times chances apply methods everyday practice.  "You yet, General Potter!" snarled Draco. "Maybe we'll run time, Professor Quirrell call draw."  A fair worrisome point. The war ended Professor Quirrell, personal judgment, decided one army practical real-world standards. There formal victory condition, Professor Quirrell explained, Harry would figure game rules. Harry admit fair cop.  And Harry blame Professor Quirrell calling end, plausible last soldier Dragon Army could take five survivors Chaos Legion.  "All right," Harry said. "Does anyone know anything General Malfoy's shield spell?"  It developed Draco's shield version standard Protego several disadvantages, important shield move caster.  The upside - Harry's perspective, downside - was easier learn, easier cast, much easier sustain long times.  They would need hammer shield attack spells order bring down.  And Draco could apparently exert control angle reflection spells would bounce off.  The thought occurred Harry could use Wingardium Leviosa pile heavy rocks shield Draco sustain pressure... rocks might fall afterward hit Draco, injuring enemy general real among today's goals.  "So," said Harry. "Are things specialized shield-piercing spells?"  There were.  Harry asked soldiers knew them.  No one did.  Draco smirking again, inside shield.  Harry asked sort attack spell bounce.  Lightning bolts, seemed, usually absorbed shields instead bouncing them.  ...No one knew cast sort lightning-related spell.  Draco sniggered.  Harry sighed.  He quite deliberately laid wand ground.  And Harry announced, weariness voice, would go ahead take shield himself, using method would remain mysterious; everyone else fire Draco soon shield went down.  The Chaos Legionnaires looked nervous.  Draco looked calm, say, controlled.  A thin, folded blanket came Harry's pouch.  Harry sat next shimmering shield, pulled blanket head one could see - except Draco, course.  From Harry's pouch came car battery set jumper cables.  ...it like he'd leave Muggle world start new era magical research, take along way generating electricity.  Shortly after, Chaos Legionnaires heard sound fingers snapping, followed crackling noise beneath blanket. The shield started glowing brightly, Harry's voice said, "Don't distracted please, eyes General Malfoy."  The strain showing Draco's face, along fury annoyance frustration.  Harry smiled him, mouthed, Tell later.  And spiral green energy shot forest smashed Draco's shield, shrieked like pieces sharp glass rubbed together, Draco staggered.  In sudden, frantic panic, Harry took jumper cables battery fed pouch, fed battery pouch, tore blanket grabbed wand stood up.  All soldiers still glancing around frantically.  "Contego," Harry said, soldiers followed suit, Harry even know direction shield ought pointing in. "Did anyone see came from?" Shaken heads. "And General Malfoy, would mind telling got General Granger?"  "Why yes," Draco said acidly, "I mind."  Oh, hell.  Harry's mind began calculating, Draco inside shield, Draco worn degree, Harry worn too, Hermione woods who-knew-where, Harry four Chaotics left...  "You know, General Granger," Harry said loud, "you really waited attack I'd fought General Malfoy. You might've able get survivors."  From somewhere came girl's high-pitched laughter.  Harry froze.  That Hermione.  And dreadful, eerie, cheerful chant began rise, coming around them.  "Don't frightened, sad,   We'll hurt bad..."  "Granger cheated!" burst Draco inside shield. "She woke soldiers! Why Professor Quirrell -"  "Let guess," Harry said, sickness already churning stomach. He really hated losing. "It easy battle, right? They dropped like flies?"  "Yes," Draco said. "We got first shot -"  The look horrified realization spread Draco Chaos Legionnaires.  "No," Harry said, "we didn't."  Camouflaged forms appearing among trees.  "Allies?" Harry said.  "Allies," Draco said.  "Good," said General Granger's voice, spiral green energy blazed woods shattered Draco's shield splinters.   General Granger surveyed battlefield definite feeling satisfaction. She nine Sunshine Soldiers, probably enough handle last survivor enemy forces, especially Parvati Anthony Ernie already holding wands General Potter, she'd ordered taken alive (well, conscious).  It Bad, knew, she'd really really really wanted gloat.  "There's trick, there?" said Harry, strain showing voice. "There trick. You can't turn perfect general. Not top everything else. You're Slytherin! You write creepy poetry! No one's good everything!"  General Granger glanced around Sunshine Soldiers, looked back Harry. Everyone probably watching screens outside.  And General Granger said, "I anything I study hard enough."  "Oh that's bu-"  "Somnium."  Harry slumped ground mid-sentence.  "SUNSHINE WINS," intoned huge voice Professor Quirrell, seeming come everywhere nowhere.  "Niceness triumphed!" cried General Granger.  "Hooray!" shouted Sunshine Soldiers. Even Gryffindor boys said it, said pride.  "And what's moral today's battle?" said General Granger.  "We anything study hard enough!"  And survivors Sunshine Regiment marched toward victory field, singing marching song went:  Don't frightened, sad,   We'll hurt bad,   And send home that's true,   With new friends watch you,   Be sure tell sent   By Granger's Sunshine Regiment!   Chapter 31: Working Groups, Pt 2  Aftermaths:   Harry paced backward forward general's office, made wonderful room pacing, uses far could tell.  How?  How?  Hermione battle! Not first try, violent nature, automatically great military commander top everything else much even her.  Had read tactic military history book? But one tactic, she'd forces perfectly positioned block retreat, troops better coordinated Draco's...  Had Professor Quirrell broken promise help her? Had given diary General Tacticus something?  Harry missing something here, something really important, mind went around around circles, still figure out.  Finally Harry sighed. He getting anywhere this, go learn Breaking Drill Hex Hermione someone next battle - Professor Quirrell explained Harry, voice amused sharp undertone warning, "no magical items except ones I give you" included Muggle technology matter much magic. Plus Harry also needed figure bring Mr. Goyle next time...  Battles counted lot Quirrell points general, Harry needed get cracking wanted win Professor Quirrell's Christmas wish.   In private room Slytherin, Draco Malfoy stared space, though wall front desk fascinating surface world.  How?  How?  In retrospect obvious sort idea cunning plots went, Granger supposed cunning! She'd much Hufflepuff use Simple Strike Hex! Had Professor Quirrell advising despite promise, or...  And Draco finally done much earlier.  What done first time met Granger.  What Harry Potter told do, trained do, yet Harry also warned Draco would take time make brain realize methods applied real life, Draco understood today. He could avoided every single one mistakes he'd applied things Harry already told -  Draco said loud, "I notice I confused."  Your strength rationalist ability confused fiction reality...  Draco confused.  Therefore, something believed fiction.  Granger able that.  Therefore, probably hadn't.  I promise help General Granger way two know about.  With sudden horrified realization, Draco swept papers way, hunting mess desk, found it.  And was.  Right list people equipment assigned three armies.  Curse Professor Quirrell!  Draco read still seen -   The afternoon sunlight poured office Sunshine Regiment, illuminating General Granger chair though glowed golden aura.  "How long think take Malfoy figure out?" said General Granger.  "Not long," said Colonel Blaise Zabini. "He may already. How long take Potter figure out?"  "Forever," said General Granger, "unless Malfoy tells him, one soldiers realizes. Harry Potter think like that."  "Really?" said Captain Ernie Macmillan, looking one corner tables crushed chess Captain Ron Weasley. (They'd brought back chairs Malfoy left, course.) "I mean seems kind obvious me. Who would try come ideas themselves?"  "Harry," said Hermione, exactly time Zabini said, "Malfoy."  "Malfoy thinks he's way better everyone else," said Zabini.  "And Harry... really see people like that," said Hermione.  It kind sad, actually. Harry grown very, alone. It went around thinking words geniuses right exist. It occur anyone Hermione's army besides Hermione could good ideas.  "Anyhow," Hermione said. "Captains Goldstein Weasley, duty thinking strategic ideas next battle. Captains Macmillan Susan - sorry, I mean Macmillan Bones - try come tactics use, also training think try. Oh, congratulations marching song, Captain Goldstein, I think big plus esprit de corps."  "What're doing?" said Susan. "And Colonel Zabini?"  Hermione stood chair, stretching. "I'll try figure Harry Potter thinking Colonel Zabini try figure Draco Malfoy might do, us join come something. I'm going walk I think. Zabini, want come along?"  "Yes, General," said Zabini stiffly.  It meant order. Hermione sighed little. This going take getting used to, although Zabini's first idea certainly worked, quite sure Professor Quirrell's quote mixture positive negative incentives unquote would enough keep Slytherin fully side December traitors would allowed first time...  She still idea going Professor Quirrell's Christmas wish, either. Maybe she'd ask Mandy wanted anything, time came around.   Chapter 32: Interlude: Personal Financial Management  "But Headmaster," Harry argued, desperation leaking voice, "leaving assets one undiversified vault full gold coins - crazy, Headmaster! It's like, I know, Transfiguration experiments without consulting recognized authority! You money!"  From lined face old wizard - underneath festive holiday hat like catastrophic automobile collision cars green red cloth - grave, sad look peered Harry.  "I'm sorry, Harry," said Dumbledore, "and I apologize, allowing control finances would give far much independence action."  Harry's mouth opened sound came out. He was, literally, speechless.  "I permit withdraw five Galleons Christmas presents," said Dumbledore, "which boy age spend, poses threat, I think -"  "I can't believe said that!" words burst Harry's mouth. "You admit manipulative?"  "Manipulative?" said old wizard, smiling slightly. "No, manipulative would I admit it, I deeper motive behind obvious. This quite straightforward, Harry. You yet ready play game, would foolish allow thousands Galleons upset gameboard."   The bright hustle bustle Diagon Alley increased hundredfold redoubled Christmas approached, shops enshrouded brilliant sorceries flashed sparkled though season's spirit blaze control turn whole area cheerful holiday crater. The streets crowded witches wizards festive loud clothing eyes assaulted almost severely ears; clear, bewildering variety shoppers, Diagon Alley considered international attraction. There witches wrapped giant swathes cloth like toweled mummies, wizards formal top hats bath-robes, young children barely past toddling age decorated lights blazed almost bright shops themselves, parents took hand hand magic wonderland let shriek heart's content. It season merry.  And midst light cheer, note blackest night; cold, dark atmosphere cleared precious paces distance even midst crush.  "No," said Professor Quirrell, look grim revulsion, like he'd bitten food tasted horrible morally repugnant boot. It sort grim face ordinary person might make biting meat pie, discovering rotten made kittens.  "Oh, come on," Harry said. "You must ideas."  "Mr. Potter," Professor Quirrell said, lips set thin line, "I agreed act adult guardian expedition. I agree advise choice presents. I Christmas, Mr. Potter."  "How Newtonmas?" Harry said brightly. "Isaac Newton actually born December 25th, unlike historical figures I could name."  This failed impress Professor Quirrell.  "Look," said Harry, "I'm sorry, I've got something special Fred George I've got idea options."  Professor Quirrell made thoughtful humming sound. "You could ask family members dislike, hire assassin. I know someone certain government-in-exile quite competent, would give discount multiple Weasleys."  "This Christmas," Harry said, dropping voice lower register, "give friends gift... death."  That made Professor Quirrell smile. It went way eyes.  "Well," said Harry, "at least suggest getting pet rat -" Harry's mouth snapped shut, regretting words almost soon mouth.  "Pardon me?" said Professor Quirrell.  "Nothing," Harry said once, "long dumb story." And telling seemed wrong somehow, maybe Harry afraid Professor Quirrell would laughed even Bill Weasley cured everything put back right...  And Professor Quirrell he'd never heard story? Harry gotten impression everyone magical Britain knew.  "Look," said Harry, "I'm trying solidify loyalty me, know? Make Weasley twins minions? Like old saying goes: A friend someone use throw away, friend someone use over again. Fred George two useful friends I Hogwarts, Professor Quirrell, I plan use over again. So help Slytherin here, suggest something might grateful for..." Harry's voice trailed invitingly.  You pitch things right way.  They walked good way Professor Quirrell spoke again, voice practically dripping distaste. "The Weasley twins using secondhand wands, Mr. Potter. They would reminded generosity every Charm cast."  Harry clapped hands together involuntary excitement. Just put money account Ollivander's, tell Mr. Ollivander never refund - no, better yet, send Lucius Malfoy Weasley twins show start next school year. "That's brilliant, Professor!"  Professor Quirrell look like appreciated compliment. "I suppose I tolerate Christmas spirit, Mr. Potter, though barely." Then smiled slightly. "Of course cost fourteen Galleons, five."  "Five Galleons," Harry said, sniff outrage. "Just Headmaster think he's dealing with, anyway?"  "I think," said Professor Quirrell, "that simply occur to fear consequences turned ingenuity task obtaining funds. Though wise lose, rather making explicit threat. Out curiosity, Mr. Potter, would done I turned away boredom you, fit childish pique, counted five Galleons worth Knuts?"  "Well, easiest way would've borrow money Draco Malfoy," said Harry.  Professor Quirrell chuckled briefly. "Seriously, Mr. Potter."  Duly noted. "Probably I'd done celebrity appearances. I resort anything economically disruptive spending money." Harry checked, would allowed keep Time-Turner went home holidays, sleep cycle start rotate. But also possible someone kept eye magical day traders. The gold silver trick would've taken work Muggle end, seed funding, goblins might've gotten suspicious first cycle. And starting real bank would lot work... Harry quite worked money-making methods fast certain safe, he'd glad Professor Quirrell turned easily fooled.  "I hope five Galleons enough last, since counted carefully," said Professor Quirrell. "I doubt Headmaster shall eager entrust vault key second time, discovers I've tricked."  "I'm sure best," Harry said deep gratitude.  "Do need assistance finding safe place store Knuts, Mr. Potter?"  "Well, sort of," said Harry. "Do know good investment opportunities, Professor Quirrell?"  And two walked on, tiny sphere silence isolation, brilliant bustling crowds; looked carefully, would see went, leafy boughs faded, flowers withered, children's toys played cheerful bells changed lower ominous notes.  Harry notice, say anything, smiled little himself.  Everyone way celebrating holidays, Grinch much part Christmas Santa.   Chapter 33: Coordination Problems, Pt 1  I recite myself, over, I choose sleep: It adds J. K. Rowling.  The version decision theory used chapter academically dominant one. It's based something called "timeless decision theory" that's development (among others) Gary Drescher, Wei Dai, Vladimir Nesov, and, well... (coughs times) me.   The terrifying part fast whole thing spiraled control.  "Albus," Minerva said, even trying keep worry voice two entered Great Hall, "something done."  The atmosphere Hogwarts Yuletide usually bright cheerful. The Great Hall already decorated green red, Slytherin Gryffindor whose Yule wedding become symbol friendship transcending Houses allegiances, tradition almost ancient Hogwarts even spread Muggle countries.  Now students eating dinner glancing nervously shoulders, sending vicious glares tables, tables arguing heatedly. You could described atmosphere tense, perhaps, phrase coming Minerva's mind fifth degree caution.  Take school, four Houses divided...  Now year, add three armies war.  And partisanship Dragon Sunshine Chaos spread beyond first-years; become armies armies. Students wearing armbands insignia fire smile upraised hand, hexing corridors. All three first-year generals told stop - even Draco Malfoy heard nodded grimly - supposed followers listened.  Dumbledore gazed tables distant look. "In every city," old wizard quoted softly,"the population divided long time past Blue Green factions...And fight opponents knowing end imperil themselves... So grows fellow men hostility cause, time cease disappear, gives place neither ties marriage relationship friendship, case even though differ respect colours brothers kin. I, part, unable call anything except disease soul..."  "I'm sorry," said Minerva, "I -"  "Procopius," said Dumbledore. "They took chariot-racing seriously, Roman Empire. Yes, Minerva, I agree something must done."  "Soon," Minerva said, voice lowering even further. "Albus, I think must done Saturday."  On Sunday, students would leave Hogwarts stay holiday families; Saturday, then, final battle three first-year armies would determine awarding Professor Quirrell's thrice-cursed Christmas wish.  Dumbledore glanced her, studying gravely. "You fear explosion come then, someone hurt."  Minerva nodded.  "And Professor Quirrell blamed."  Minerva nodded again, face tight. She long since become wise ways Defense Professors fired. "Albus," Minerva said, "we cannot lose Professor Quirrell now, cannot! If stays January fifth-years pass OWLs, stays March seventh-years pass NEWTs, remedying years neglect months, whole generation grow able defend spite Dark Lord's curse - must stop battle, Albus! Ban armies now!"  "I sure Defense Professor would take kindly," said Dumbledore, glancing toward Head Table Quirrell drooling soup. "He seem attached armies, though I agreed I thought would four year." The old wizard sighed. "A clever man, probably best intentions; perhaps clever enough, I fear. And ban armies might also trigger explosion."  "But Albus, do?"  The old wizard favored benign smile. "Why, I shall plot, course. It's new fashion Hogwarts."  And come close Head Table Minerva say anything more.   The terrifying part fast whole thing spiraled control.  The first battle December been... messy, Draco heard.  The second battle deranged.  And next one would worse, unless three together succeeded last desperate attempt stop it.  "Professor Quirrell, insanity," Draco said flatly. "This Slytherin more, just..." Draco loss words. He waved hands helplessly. "You can't possibly real plots stuff going on. Last battle, one soldiers faked suicide. We Hufflepuffs trying plot, think can, can't. Things happen random now, anything who's cleverest, army fights best, it's..." He even describe it.  "I agree Mr. Malfoy," said Granger tones someone ever expected hear saying words. "Allowing traitors working, Professor Quirrell."  Draco tried forbidding anyone army plot except him, driven plots underground, one wanted left soldiers armies got plot. After miserably losing last battle, he'd finally given revoked decree; soldiers already started setting personal plans motion, without sort central coordination.  After told plans, soldiers claimed plans, Draco tried sketch plot win final battle. It required considerably three different things go right, Draco used Incendio paper Everto vanish ashes, Father seen would disowned.  Professor Quirrell's eyelids half-closed, chin resting hands leaned forward onto desk. "And you, Mr. Potter?" said Defense Professor. "Are likewise agreement?"  "All we'd need shoot Franz Ferdinand could start World War One," said Harry. "It's gone complete chaos. I'm it."  "Harry!" said Draco utter shock.  He even realize second later he'd said exactly time, exactly tone indignation, Granger.  Granger shot startled glance, Draco carefully kept face neutral. Oops.  "That's right!" said Harry. "I'm betraying you! Both you! Again! Ha ha!"  Professor Quirrell smiling thinly, though eyes still half-closed. "And that, Mr. Potter?"  "Because I think I cope chaos better Miss Granger Mr. Malfoy," said traitor. "Our war zero-sum game, matter whether easy hard absolute sense, better worse."  Harry Potter learning far fast.  Professor Quirrell's eyes moved beneath lids regard Draco, Granger. "In truth, Mr. Malfoy, Miss Granger, I simply could live I shut grand debacle climax. One soldiers even become quadruple agent."  "Quadruple?" said Granger. "But there's three sides war!"  "Yes," said Professor Quirrell, "you'd think that, you. I sure ever history quadruple agent, army high fraction real pretended traitors. We exploring new realms, Miss Granger, cannot turn back now."  Draco left Defense Professor's office teeth gritting hard other, Granger looking even annoyed beside him.  "I can't believe that, Harry!" said Granger.  "Sorry," Harry said, sounding sorry all, lips curved merry smile evil. "Remember, Hermione, game, generals like us ones get plot? And besides, two going it? Team me?"  Draco traded glances Granger, knowing face tight hers. Harry relying, more openly gloatingly, Draco's refusal make common cause mudblood girl; Draco beginning get sick used him. If kept much longer going ally Granger crush Harry Potter, see much son mudblood liked that.   The terrifying part fast whole thing spiraled control.  Hermione stared parchment Zabini given her, feeling utterly completely helpless.  There names, lines connecting names names, lines different colors and...  "Tell me," said General Granger, "is anyone army spy?"  The two office another, deserted classroom, alone; because, Colonel Zabini said, nearly certain least one captains traitor. Probably Captain Goldstein, Zabini know sure.  Her question put ironic smile young Slytherin's face. Blaise Zabini always seemed little disdainful her, seem actively dislike her; nothing like derision held Draco Malfoy, resentment developed Harry Potter. She worried first Zabini betraying her, boy seemed desperate show two generals better him; Hermione thought Zabini would probably happy sell anyone else, he'd never let Malfoy Harry win.  "Most soldiers still loyal you, I'm pretty sure," said Zabini. "It's one wants left fun." The scornful look Slytherin's face made clear thought people take plotting seriously. "So think double agents secretly work side pretending betray us."  "And would also go anyone armies says want spy," Hermione said carefully.  The young Slytherin shrugged. "I think I good job telling ones really want sell Malfoy, I'm sure anyone really wants sell Potter you. But Nott sure bet betraying Potter Malfoy since I Entwhistle approach supposedly behalf Malfoy Entwhistle really reports us, that's almost good -"  Hermione closed eyes moment. "We're going lose, we?"  "Look," Zabini said patiently, "You're lead right Quirrell points. We lose last battle completely enough Quirrell points win Christmas wish."  Professor Quirrell announced final battle would operate formal scoring system, he'd asked to avoid recriminations afterward. Each time shot someone, general army got two Quirrell points. A gong would ring battle area (they know yet would fighting, though Hermione hoping forest again, Sunshine well) pitch would tell army points. And anyone faking hit, gong would ring anyway, double gong would ring later, fixed time, hail retraction. And called name army, cried "For Sunshine!" "For Chaos!" "For Dragon!", switched allegiance army...  Even Hermione able see flaw set rules. But Professor Quirrell gone announce originally assigned Sunshine, nobody could shoot name Sunshine - rather, could, Sunshine lost single Quirrell point, symbolized triple gong. That prevented shooting soldiers points, discouraged suiciding enemy got you, could still shoot spies to.  Right now, Hermione two hundred forty-four Quirrell points, Malfoy two hundred nineteen, Harry two hundred twenty-one; twenty-four soldiers army.  "So fight carefully," Hermione said, "and try lose badly."  "No," said Zabini. The young Slytherin's face serious. "The problem is, Malfoy Potter know way win combine crush us, fight own. So here's I think -"  Hermione left classroom something daze. Zabini's plan obvious one, strange complicated layered sort thing would've expected Harry come with, Zabini. It felt wrong able understand plan like that. Young girls able understand plans like that. The Hat would've Sorted Slytherin, it'd seen could understand plans like that...   The awesome thing fast he'd able escalate chaos started deliberately.  Harry sat office; he'd given authority order furniture house elves, he'd ordered throne, curtains black crimson pattern. Scarlet light like blood, mixed shadow, poured floor.  Something Harry felt like he'd finally come home.  Before stood four Lieutenants Chaos, trusted minions, one traitor.  This. This life like.  "We gathered," said Harry.  "Let Chaos reign," chorused four Lieutenants.  "My hovercraft full eels," said Harry.  "I buy record, scratched," chorused four Lieutenants.  "All mimsy borogroves."  "And mome raths outgrabe!"  That concluded formalities.  "How goes confusion?" Harry said dry whisper like Emperor Palpatine.  "It goes well, General Chaos," said Neville tone always used military matters, tone deep boy often stop cough. The Chaotic Lieutenant neatly dressed black school robes, trimmed yellow Hufflepuff House, hair parted combed usual look earnest young boy. Harry liked incongruity better cloaks they'd tried. "Our Legionnaires begun five new plots since yesterday evening."  Harry smiled evilly. "Do chance working?"  "I think so," said Neville Chaos. "Here's report."  "Excellent," said Harry, laughed chillingly took parchment Neville's hand, trying best make sound like choking dust. That brought total sixty.  Let Draco try handle that. Let try.  And Blaise Zabini...  Harry laughed again, time even take effort sound evil. He really needed borrow someone's pet Kneazle staff meetings, he'd cat stroke this.  "Can Legion stop making plots now?" said Finnigan Chaos. "I mean, enough already -"  "No," Harry said flatly. "We never enough plots."  Professor Quirrell put perfectly. They pushing boundaries further, perhaps, ever pushed; Harry able live he'd turned back now.  There came knock door.  "That Dragon General," Harry said, smiling evil prescience. "He arrives precisely I expected. Do show in, out."  And four Lieutenants Chaos shuffled out, casting dark looks Draco enemy general entered Harry's secret lair.  If allowed older, Harry going stay eleven forever.   The sun dripping red curtains, sending rays blood dancing across floor behind Harry Potter's grownup-sized cushioned chair, covered gold silver glitter insisted referring throne.  (Draco beginning feel lot confident he'd done right thing deciding overthrow Harry Potter could take world. Draco even imagine would like live rule.)  "Good evening, Dragon General," said Harry Potter chill whisper. "You arrived I expected."  This surprising, considering Draco Harry agreed meeting time advance.  And also evening, Draco knew better say anything.  "General Potter," Draco said much dignity could manage, "you know two armies work together either us win Professor Quirrell's wish, right?"  "Yesss," hissed Harry, like boy thought Parselmouth. "We must cooperate destroy Sunshine, fight us. But one us betrays earlier on, one could gain advantage later fight. And Sunshine General, knows this, try trick us thinking betrayed them. And I, know that, tempted betray pretend Granger's trickery. And Granger knows that, well."  Draco nodded. That much obvious. "And... us want win, there's one else who'll punish either us defect..."  "Precisely," said Harry Potter, face turning serious. "We faced true Prisoner's Dilemma."  The Prisoner's Dilemma, according Harry's teachings, ran thus: Two prisoners locked separate cells. There evidence prisoner, minor evidence, enough prison sentence two years apiece. Each prisoner could opt defect, betray other, testify court; would take one year prison sentence, add two years other's. Or prisoner could cooperate, staying silent. So prisoners defected, testifying other, would serve three years apiece; cooperated, stayed silent, would serve two years each; one defected cooperated, defector would serve single year, cooperator would serve four.  And prisoners make decision without knowing one's choice, neither would given chance change decision afterward.  Draco observed two prisoners Death Eaters Wizarding War, Dark Lord would killed traitors.  Harry nodded said one way resolve Prisoner's Dilemma - fact Death Eaters would want Dark Lord exactly reason.  (Draco asked Harry stop let think continued. It explained lot Father friends agreed serve Dark Lord often nice them...)  In fact, Harry said, pretty much reason people governments - might better stole someone else, like prisoner would individually better defected Prisoner's Dilemma. But everyone thought like that, country would fall chaos everyone would worse off, like would happen prisoners defected. So people let ruled governments, like Death Eaters let ruled Dark Lord.  (Draco asked Harry stop again. Draco always taken granted ambitious wizards put power wanted rule, people let ruled scared little Hufflepuffs. And this, reflection, still seemed true; Harry's perspective fascinating even wrong.)  But, Harry continued afterward, fear third party punishing possible reason cooperate Prisoner's Dilemma.  Suppose, Harry said, playing game magically produced identical copy yourself.  Draco said two Dracos, course neither Draco would want anything bad happen one, mention Malfoy would let become known traitor.  Harry nodded again, said yet another solution Prisoner's Dilemma - people might cooperate cared other, senses honor, wanted preserve reputation. Indeed, Harry said, rather difficult construct true Prisoner's Dilemma - real life, people usually cared person, honor reputation Dark Lord's punishment something besides prison sentences. But suppose copy someone completely selfish -  (Pansy Parkinson example they'd used)  - Pansy cared happened Pansy.  Given Pansy cared about... Dark Lord... Pansy worried reputation... Pansy either sense honor consider obligated prisoner... would rational thing Pansy cooperate, defect?  Some people, Harry said, claimed rational thing Pansy defect copy, Harry, plus someone named Douglas Hofstadter, thought people wrong. Because, Harry said, Pansy defected - random, seemed like rational reasons - Pansy would think exactly way. Two identical copies decide different things. So Pansy choose world Pansies cooperated, world Pansies defected, better copies cooperated. And Harry thought 'rational' people defect Prisoner's Dilemma, done anything spread kind 'rationality', country conspiracy full 'rational' people would dissolve chaos. You would tell enemies 'rationality'.  Which sounded reasonable time, thought occurring Draco that...  "You said," Draco said, "that rational solution Prisoner's Dilemma cooperate. But course would want believe that, you?" And Draco fooled cooperating, Harry would say, Ha ha, betrayed again! laugh afterward.  "I fake lessons," Harry said seriously. "But I remind you, Draco, I say automatically cooperate. Not true Prisoner's Dilemma like one. What I said choose, think like choosing yourself, like choosing everyone. You think like choosing people similar enough they'll probably thing reasons. And also choosing predictions made anyone knows well enough predict accurately, never regret rational correct predictions people make - remind explain Newcomb's Problem point. So question I ask, Draco, this: similar enough we'll probably thing whatever is, making decisions mostly way? Or know well enough predict other, I predict whether cooperate defect, predict I've decided thing I predict do, I know predict deciding that?"  ...and Draco could help think since strain understand half that, answer obviously 'No'.  "Yes," said Draco.  There pause.  "I see," said Harry, sounding disappointed. "Oh, well. I guess we'll think way, then."  Draco thought going work.  Draco Harry talked back forth. They agreed much earlier battlefield would count broken promises real life - though Draco little angry Harry done Professor Quirrell's office, said so.  But two rely honor friendship, leave question get armies work together beating Sunshine, despite everything Granger might try break up. Professor Quirrell's rules make tempting let Sunshine kill army's soldiers - increased bar pass - tempt side steal kills instead acting like single army would, shoot side's soldiers confusion battle...   Hermione walking back Ravenclaw really looking going, mind preoccupied war treachery age-inappropriate concepts, turned corner bumped straight grownup.  "Sorry," said automatically, then, entirely without thinking, "Eeeeek!"  "Don't worry, Miss Granger," said cheerful smile, set beneath twinkling eyes, silver beard, HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS. "You quite forgiven."  Her gaze helplessly locked kindly face powerful wizard world, also Chief Warlock, also Supreme Mugwump, gone insane years ago stress fighting Dark Lord, numerous facts popping mind one throat went making little embarrassing squeaks.  "In fact, Miss Granger," said Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, "it quite lucky bumped other. Why, I wondering curiously three thinking asking wishes..."   Saturday dawned bright clear students speaking hushed voices, though first shout might set explosion.   Draco hoped would fighting upper levels Hogwarts again. Professor Quirrell said real fights likely take place cities forests, fighting inside schoolrooms corridors supposed simulate that, ribbons mark allowed areas. Dragon Army done well fights.  Instead, Draco feared, Professor Quirrell come something special battle.  The battleground Hogwarts Lake.  And boats, either.  They fighting underwater.  The Giant Squid temporarily paralyzed; spells set place keep away grindylows; Professor Quirrell gone talked merfolk; soldiers issued potions underwater action allowed breathe, see clearly, talk other, swim quite fast fast walk kicking legs.  A huge silver sphere hung center battleground, shining like small underwater moon. It would help provide sense direction - first. The moon would slowly go eclipse battle went on, gone entirely dark, battle would end already.  War water. You defend perimeter, attackers could come direction, even potion see far darkness lake.  And swam far away action, would start glow while, easy hunt - ordinarily army scattered ran instead fighting, Professor Quirrell would declare defeated; today working points system. Of course still time started glow, wanted play assassin.  Dragon Army set low water start game; far away, distant underwater moon shone. The murky water mostly lit Lumos Charms, though soldiers would extinguish lights soon began maneuvers. There point letting enemy see saw them.  Draco kicked legs times, propelling higher position could gaze soldiers hovered water.  The conversations died almost Draco's icy glare, soldiers looking gratifying expressions fear worry.  "Listen carefully," said General Malfoy. His voice came little lower, little burbly bubbles, libsten vebwy caerbfully, sound traveled clearly. "There's one way win this. We've got march Sunshine together Chaos, beat Sunshine. Then fight Potter win. That's got happen, understand? No matter else goes on, part happen way -"  And Draco explained plan Harry come with.  Astonished looks exchanged among soldiers.  "- plots get way that," finished Draco, "after water, I set fire."  There nervous chorus yessirs.  "And everyone secret orders, make sure carry letter," said Draco.  Around half soldiers openly nodded, Draco marked death rose power.  Of course private orders fake, like one Dragon told offer false traitor's commission another Dragon, second Dragon told hushed confidence report anything said first Dragon. Draco told Dragon whole war could depend one thing, hoped understood important plans they'd previously made. With luck would keep idiots happy, maybe flush spies boot, reports match instructions.  Draco's real plan winning Chaos... well, simpler one he'd burned, Father still liked it. Despite trying, though, Draco able think anything better. It plot possibly worked anyone except Harry Potter. In fact Harry's plan originally, according traitor, though Draco guessed without told. Draco traitor modified little...   Harry took deep breath, feeling water gurgle harmlessly lungs.  They'd fought forest, gotten chance say it.  They'd fought corridors Hogwarts, gotten chance say it.  They'd fought air, broomsticks issued every soldier, still made sense say it.  Harry thought ever get say words, still young enough real...  The Chaos Legionnaires looking Harry puzzlement, general swam feet pointing toward distant light surface, head pointed toward murky depths.  "Why upside down?" young commander shouted army, began explain fight abandoned privileged orientation gravity.   A hollow, booming bell echoed water, instant, Zabini Anthony five soldiers struck downward, murky depths lake. Parvati Patil, Gryffindor group, turned head back moment gave cheery wave dived; moment, Scott Matt same. The rest sank vanished.  General Granger swallowed lump throat watched go. She risking everything this, dividing army instead trying take many enemy soldiers possible.  The thing realize, Zabini told her, army would move plan let expect victory. Sunshine plan win themselves, make armies think would win late.  Ernie Ron still looked like shock. Susan gazing disappearing soldiers calculating look. Her army, left it, looked bewildered, traceries light dappling uniforms drifted sunlit surface lake.  "Now what?" said Ron.  "Now wait," said Hermione, loudly enough soldiers hear. It felt odd talk mouth full water, kept feeling like committing sort horrible impoliteness dinner table drool herself. "All us left going get zapped, going happen anyway Dragon Chaos ganging us. We've got take many us can."  "I've got plan," said one Sunshine Soldiers... Hannah, voice little hard recognize first. "It's like complicated, I know get Dragon Chaos start fighting -"  "Me too!" said Fay. "I've got plan too! See, Neville Longbottom secretly side -"  "You talking Neville?" said Ernie. "That's right, I one -"  Daphne Greengrass couple Slytherins gone Zabini giggling helplessly cries "No, wait, I one got Longbottom" erupted one soldier another.  Hermione looked wearily.  "Okay," said Hermione died down, "does everyone get it? All plots faked Chaos Legion, maybe Dragon. Anyone really wanted betray Harry Malfoy went straight Zabini, you. Just go ahead compare notes secret plots see yourselves." She might good plotting Zabini, could always understand officers told her, Professor Quirrell made general. "So bother trying plots armies get here. Just fight, okay? Please?"  "But," said Ernie shock face, "Neville Hufflepuff! You're saying lied us?"  Daphne laughing hard helplessly exhalations turned upside water.  "I'm sure Longbottom is," said Ron darkly, "but I think he's Hufflepuff more. Not Harry Potter's got him."  "Do know," said Susan, "I asked that, Neville told become Chaos Hufflepuff?"  "Anyway," said Hermione loud voice. "Zabini took everyone thought spy, army stop watching quite hard now, I hope."  "Anthony spy?" yelled Ron.  "Parvati spy?" gasped Hannah.  "Parvati totally spy," said Daphne. "She shopped spy shoe store wore spy lipstick, someday going marry nice spy husband lot little spies."  And gong sound echoed water, indicating Sunshine scored two points.  This shortly followed triple gong Dragon losing single point.  Traitors allowed kill generals, disaster first battle December three generals shot first minute. But luck...  "Aw," said Hermione. "It sounds like Mr. Crabbe taking little nap."   Like two shoals fish, armies swam along.  Neville Longbottom kicked feet slow, measured motions. Diving, always diving whatever direction happened moving. You wanted show enemy smallest profile, present head feet. So always diving, downward head-first, enemy always down.  Like every Chaos Legionnaire army, Neville's head constantly rotating swam, looking up, down, around, every side. Not watching Sunshine Soldiers, watching sign Chaos Legionnaire drawn wand betray them. Usually traitors waited confusion battle make move, early gong put guard.  ...the truth was, Neville feeling sad that. In November he'd soldier united army, pulling together helping other, watching constantly first signs betrayal. It might fun General Chaos, nearly much fun Neville.  The direction formerly known 'up' getting steadily brighter, came closer surface Sunshine.  "Wands out," said General Chaos.  Neville's squad drew wands, pointing straight ahead toward enemy, heads scanned around rapidly. If Sunny traitors, time approaching strike.  The shoal fish, Dragon Army, thing.  "Now!" shouted distant voice Dragon General.  "Now!" shouted General Chaos.  "For Sunshine!" shouted soldiers armies, charged downward.   "What?" said Minerva involuntarily watched screens next lake, cry echoed many places; Hogwarts watching battle watched first.  Professor Quirrell laughing dryly. "I warned you, Headmaster. It impossible rules without Mr. Potter exploiting them."   For long precious seconds, forty-seven soldiers charged seventeen, Hermione's mind went blank.  Why...  Then snapped place.  Every time soldier originally Sunshine got shot someone crying name Sunshine, would lose Quirrell point. When two Sunshine Soldiers shot either army, enemy armies would two points closer overtaking her, gain shared. And anyone shot another soldier name Sunshine, gong get lost confusion...  Hermione suddenly glad Zabini gone obvious plan starting trouble two armies attacked Sunshine.  It still disheartening, though, sense chances closing down, hope taken away.  Most Hermione's soldiers still looking confused, expressions dawning horror got it.  "It's right," Susan Bones said firmly. Heads turned look Sunshine Captain. "Our job same, take many us can. And remember, Zabini took away spies! We stay lookout like do!" The girl smiling defiantly, provoking answering smiles many soldiers, even Hermione herself. "It like November. We keep heads high, fight best, trust -"  Daphne shot her.   "Blood blood god!" shrieked Neville Chaos, though since underwater came like 'Blubbled blubbled glub!'  Captain Weasley spun raised wand toward Neville fired. But Neville swimming downward toward him, wand pointed straight ahead, meant Simple Shield could shelter Neville's entire profile; anyone shot now, going Sunny Ron.  A grimly determined look came Captain Weasley's face, arrowed straight toward Neville, mouthing word Contego, though shield visible water.  The two enemy champions shot toward like arrows released bows, aimed split middle. They dueled many times before, time would pay all.  (Far away lakeside, hundred breaths held.)  "Rainbows unicorns!" roared Sunshine Captain.  "The Black Goat thousand young!"  "Do homework!"  Closer yet closer, two champions charged, neither willing swerve, first person turn would present vulnerable broadside get shot, though neither lost nerve would crash right other...  Falling straight enemy rose straight meet him, hammer descending meet anvil path neither willing leave...  "Special attack, Chaotic Twist!"  Neville saw look horror Captain Weasley's face Hover Charm caught him. They'd tested battle started; Harry suspected, Wingardium Leviosa became whole new sort weapon everyone swimming underwater.  "Curse you, Longbottom!" shrieked Ron Weasley, "Can't ever fight without dumb special attacks -"  time Sunshine Captain spun around sideways Neville shot leg.  "I fight fair," said Neville sleeping form, "I fight like Harry Potter."   Granger: 237 / Malfoy: 217 / Potter: 220  It still hurt every time shoot Hermione. Harry could hardly stand look expression peace come sleeping face, arms drifting aimlessly curves sunlight moved camouflage uniform cloud chestnut hair.  And Harry tried duck one shoot her... would Draco known meant, Hermione would offended.  She's dead, Harry said brain kicking feet pushed away, resting. IDIOT.  Are sure? said brain. What ex-Hermione? Could go back check?  Harry glanced back briefly.  See, fine, bubbles coming mouth.  Could've last breath escaping.  Oh quiet. Why paranoid-protective, anyway?  Er, first real friend we've ever whole life? Hey, remember happened pet rock?  Would SHUT UP worthless lump rubble, even alive let alone sentient, like pathetic childhood trauma ever -  The two armies swiftly separated, becoming two shoals fish more.  General Granger gone seventeen points, taken three Chaotics two Dragons her; one Chaotic two Dragons shot traitors. So she'd lost net seven points, Harry lost one, Draco lost two; put Sunshine twenty points Dragon, seventeen points Chaos. Chaos could still win easily exterminated twenty remaining Dragons. The wild card, course, seven remaining Sunshine Soldiers...  ...if could call that.  The two shoals swam uneasily next other, soldiers army awaiting order call true allegiances, attack...  "Everyone got them," Harry said loudly, "remember Special Orders One Three. And forget Merlin Says Three. Do acknowledge."  The trustworthy two-thirds army nod, third looked puzzled.  Special Order One: Don't bother trying call codewords battle, expend effort plot specially approved commander; swim, shield, fire.  Hermione Draco fighting soldiers, trying get stop plotting December. Harry egged soldiers supported plotting last two battles... also telling future point might ask put plot two hold, they'd readily agreed. So now, critical battle, happy obey.  Neither Hermione Draco could given order successfully, Harry certain. It difference soldiers seeing ally plotting, seeing spoilsport old fuddy-duddy want fun. Imposition order equaled escalation chaos, also worked reverse...  "There are!" shouted someone, pointed.  From depths lake arose forgotten ones, ones who'd forsaken last battle, seven missing Sunshine Soldiers, glowing bright aura cowards, fading returned battle.  The two shoals fish wavered, pointing wands uneasily.  "Hold fire!" shouted Harry, similar cry came General Malfoy.  There moment held breath.  Then seven Sunshine Soldiers swam join Dragon Army.  There triumphant cheer Dragon Army.  There cries dismay third Chaos Legion.  Some two-thirds smiled, though have.  Harry smiling.  Oh, completely going work...  But Harry able think anything better.  "Special Orders Two Three still apply!" shouted Harry. "Fight!"  "For Chaos Legion!" roared twenty Chaotic Legionnaires.  "For Dragon Army!" roared twenty Dragon Warriors seven Sunshine Soldiers.  And Chaotics dived straight downward, traitors got ready strike.   Granger: 237 / Malfoy: 220 / Potter: 226  Draco's head darted around frantically, trying weigh happening; somehow, despite greater forces, he'd lost initiative. Four small Chaotic forces pursued four larger Dragon forces, Draco's forces ones trying force engagement, meant follow Chaos ran, somehow producing concentrations Chaotic force would fire exposed sides Dragon -  It happening again!  "Prismatis!" shouted Draco, raising wand, shield could see even water, sparkling multicolored flat wall wide enough shield Draco five Dragons Chaotic force started firing swam past, let five Dragons turn attentions back Chaotic force they'd chasing -  There tense moment sleep spell sleep spell crashed Draco's Prismatic Wall, Draco hoping Merlin none four Chaotics learned Breaking Drill Hex -  Then bell Dragon victory, Chaotic force spun head-for-foot began swimming away; Draco, hands shaking slightly, dropped Prismatic Wall lowered wand.  Fighting water exhausting even fighting broomsticks.  "Do pursue!" Draco cried soldiers started follow, then, "Sonorus! REFORM ON ME!"  The Dragon forces started converging Draco, Chaotic forces spun around began pursuing Dragons instant - Draco swore loud heard bell Chaotic victory, someone gotten Simple Shield oriented right - Dragon forces supporting range Chaotics moving back murky distance.  Somehow, despite numerical superiority, Dragons scored three times Chaotics Chaotics scored four times back, he'd heard one Dragon spy get executed. Either Harry Potter thought lot good ideas fast, unimaginable reason he'd already spent lot time working fight underwater. This working, Draco needed rethink things.  It looked like everyone trouble aiming swimming, too, battle might last long enough time would called... distant underwater moon half full now, good... rethink things fast...  "What it?" said Padma Patil, force swam toward Draco.  Padma second-in-command; clever powerful, better yet, hated Granger saw Harry rival, made trustworthy. Working Padma making realize truth old adage Ravenclaw sister Slytherin; Draco surprised father told acceptable House future wife, saw sense it.  "Wait we're here," Draco said. The truth was, needed catch breath. That trouble general powerful wizard, keep using magic.  Zabini came next, commanding force two Sunnies four Dragons, one Gregory keeping eye Zabini. Draco trust Zabini. And neither Draco Zabini trusted Sunnies enough make majority unit; supposed loyal either Draco directly, Granger who'd fooled promise Dragons would betrayed end forces depleted, Harry's trusted Chaotics fooled shooting Sunnies promise firing fake Sleep Hexes switching support Chaos later; possible Sunnies loyal Chaos firing real Sleep Hexes Dragon winning way numerical advantage let win...  The next unit approached depleted, three soldiers holding wands two soldiers, swimming empty hands.  Draco gritted teeth. More traitor problems. He needed talk Professor Quirrell way punish traitors least, conditions like unrealistic, real life tortured traitors death.  "General Malfoy!" shouted commander problem unit swam up, Ravenclaw boy named Terry. "We know - Cesi shot Bogdan, Cesi says Kellah told Bogdan shot Specter -"  "I didn't!" said Kellah.  "Yes did!" shrieked Cesi. "General Malfoy, spy, I rea-"  "Somnium," said Draco.  There triple bell one-point loss Dragon, Kellah's limp body began float away water.  Draco heard word 'recursion' point, knew Harry Potter plot saw one.  (Unfortunately Draco heard autoimmune disorders, thought readily occur clever virus would begin attack creating symptoms autoimmune disorder get body distrust immune system...)  "General order!" said Draco, raising voice. "Nobody gets shoot spies except myself, Gregory, Padma, Terry. If anyone sees anything suspicious come one us."  And -  There bell Sunshine scoring two points.  "What?" said Draco Zabini around time; heads swiveled around. No one seemed gotten hit, Sunshine soldiers present accounted for. (Except Parvati, shot still-unknown traitor Padma's squad; course Padma shot Parvati case faking, her...)  "A Sunny traitor Chaos?" said Zabini, sounding puzzled. "But ones I knew supposed strike Chaos's attack Sunshine -"  "No!" said Padma tone sudden realization. "That Chaos executing spy!"  "What?" said Zabini. "But -"  And Draco got it. Damn it! "Because Potter thinks he's safe much beats Sunshine, much beats us! So want lose single point executes traitor! General order! If execute traitor, call Sunshine first! And forget switch back Dragon afterward -"   Granger: 253 / Malfoy: 252 / Potter: 252  Longbottom's body drifted chaotically water, arms legs disarrayed. After Draco finally got hit they'd shot sure.  Nearby Harry Potter, protected Prismatic Sphere, looking grimly last sliver crescent moon slowly diminished, somewhere far away. If Longbottom managed shoot one soldier (Draco knew Harry thinking), two Chaotics managed hold little longer, might won...  After Draco reformed forces struck again, ensuing battle execution spies Sunshine's name left Sunshine exactly one point ahead Dragon Chaos both. Once Harry started it, Draco left choice follow suit.  But General Chaos outnumbered three one, survivors Dragon Army last remaining Sunny traitor: Draco, Padma, Zabini.  And Draco, fool, ordered Padma take Zabini's wand Longbottom shot Gregory fallen turn Draco. The boy given insulted look, told Draco owed this, handed over.  That left Draco Padma take General Chaos.  "I suppose like surrender?" said Draco, smiling evilly smile he'd ever directed Harry Potter.  "Sleep surrender!" shouted General Chaos.  "Just know," said Draco, "Zabini actually older sister rescue Gryffindor bullies. But Zabini mother approve Muggleborns like Granger, I wrote notes, offered Zabini favors - nothing involving father, things I school. And way, Zabini's mother approve Boy-Who-Lived, either. Just case still thought Zabini really side."  Harry's face grew even grimmer.  Draco raised wand, began breathing rhythmically, building strength Breaking Drill Hex. Granger's Prismatic Sphere almost strong Draco's now, Harry's much weaker, two find time?  "Lagann!" spoke Draco, putting everything it, green spiral blazed Harry's shield shattered, almost moment -  "Somnium!" said Padma.   Granger: 253 / Malfoy: 252 / Potter: 254  Harry let long breath relief, hold Prismatic Sphere more. His hand shaking lowered wand.  "You know," said Harry, "I pretty worried moment."  Special Order Two: If Sunny traitor seem really shooting you, fake hit occasionally. Prefer targeting Dragons Sunnies go ahead shoot Sunnies can't shoot Dragons.  Special Order Three: Merlin says shoot Blaise Zabini either Patil twin.  With wide grin, Parvati Patil stripped Transfigured patch uniform's insignia, let float away water.  "Gryffindors Chaos," said, handed Zabini wand back.  "Thank much," Harry said, bowed sweepingly Gryffindor girl. "And thank well," bowing Zabini. "You know, came plan, I wondered brilliant crazy, I've decided both. And way," Harry said, turning though address Draco's body, "Zabini cousin -"  "Somnium," said Zabini's voice.   Granger: 255 / Malfoy: 252 / Potter: 254  And Harry Potter's body floated away, expression shock horror quickly relaxing sleep.  "On second thought," Parvati said cheerfully, "make Gryffindors Sunshine."  She started laugh, exhiliarated she'd ever life, she'd finally gotten assassinate replace twin sister she'd wanted since forever, perfect, perfect -  - wand spun around lightning motion Zabini's wand turned point her.  "Wait!" said Zabini. "Do shoot, resist. That's order."  "What?" said Parvati.  "Sorry," said Zabini, looking not-quite-sincerely apologetic, "but I can't totally sure Sunshine. So I order let shoot you."  "Hold on!" said Parvati. "We're ahead Chaos one point! If shoot -"  "I'll shoot name Dragon, obviously," said Zabini, sounding little superior. "Just tricked it, mean work us."  Parvati stared him, eyes narrowing. "General Malfoy said mother like Hermione."  "I suppose," said Zabini, still superior smirk. "But us willing Draco Malfoy annoy parent."  "And Harry Potter said cousin -"  "Nope," said Zabini.  Parvati stared him, trying think, really good plotting; Zabini'd said plan secretly keep scores Chaos Dragon even possible they'd use Sunshine's name execute traitors instead losing even single point, worked... but... feeling missing something, Slytherin...  "Why I shoot name Dragon?" said Parvati.  "Because I outrank you," said Zabini.  Parvati bad feeling this.  She stared long moment.  And -  "Somni-" started say, realized said Dragon, frantically cut -   Granger: 255 / Malfoy: 254 / Potter: 254  "Hey, everyone," said Blaise Zabini's face screens, looking quite amused, "guess me."  All lakeside, people holding breath.  Sunshine ahead Dragon Chaos exactly one point.  Blaise Zabini could shoot name either Dragon Chaos, leave things way were.  A series chimes indicated last minute time running out.  And Slytherin smiling strange, twisted smile, casually toying wand, dark wood barely visible dark water.  "You know," said Blaise Zabini's voice, tones someone who'd rehearsing words while, "it's game, really. And games supposed fun. So I whatever I feel like?"   Chapter 34: Coordination Problems, Pt 2  Minerva Dumbledore together applied combined talent conjure grand stage toward Quirrell slowly trudged; was, core, sturdy wood, outer surfaces shone glitter marble inlaid platinum studded gems every House color. Neither Headmaster Founder Hogwarts, conjuration needed last hours. Minerva ordinarily enjoyed occasions occasion tire large Transfigurations; enjoyed many small chances artistry, illusion opulence; time done work dreadful feeling digging grave.  But Minerva feeling little better now. There'd one brief moment explosion might've come; Dumbledore already standing applauding warmly, one proven foolish enough riot front Headmaster.  And explosive mood rapidly faded collective sentiment might perhaps described phrase: Give us break!  Blaise Zabini shot name Sunshine, final score 254 254 254.      Behind stage, waiting ascend, three children glaring mingled fury frustration. It help still damp fished lake, Warming Charms seem quite enough make crisp December air, maybe mood.  "That's it," said Granger. "I've it! No traitors!"  "I completely agree you, Miss Granger," Draco said icily. "Enough enough."  "And two intend it?" snapped Harry Potter. "Professor Quirrell already said ban spies!"  "We'll ban him," said Draco grimly. He even understood meant words said them, act speaking seemed crystallize plan -   The stage really well done, least temporary structure; makers fallen usual pitfall impressed illusion wealth, knew something architecture visual style. From Draco stood, obvious place stand, watching students would see haloed faint glitter emeralds; Granger, standing Draco subtly motioned her, would haloed Ravenclaw's sapphire. As Harry Potter, Draco looking right now.  Professor Quirrell had... awakened, whatever did; leaning upon platinum podium bare gems. With evident showmanship, Defense Professor carefully stacking squaring three envelopes containing three parchments upon three generals written wishes, students Hogwarts watched, waited.  Finally Professor Quirrell looked envelopes. "Well," said Defense Professor. "This inconvenient."  A slight titter laughter ran crowd, sharp undertone.  "I suppose wondering I do?" said Professor Quirrell. "There nothing it; I shall fair. Although first little speech I wanted make, even that, appears Mr. Malfoy Miss Granger something wish share."  Draco blinked, Granger traded rapid glances - may I? - yes, go ahead - Draco raised voice.  "General Granger I would like say," Draco said formal voice, knowing amplified heard, "that longer accept help traitors. And if, battle, find Potter accepted traitors either armies, join forces crush him."  And Draco shot glance filled malice Boy-Who-Lived. Take that, General Chaos!  "I agree completely General Malfoy," said Granger standing beside him, high voice clear strong. "Neither us use traitors, General Potter does, wipe battlefield."  There susurration surprise watching students.  "Very good," said Defense Professor, smiling. "It took two long enough, still congratulated thought generals."  It took moment soak -  "In future, Mr. Malfoy, Miss Granger, come office request, consider whether way accomplish without help. I deduct Quirrell points occasion, next time may expect lose full fifty." Professor Quirrell wore amused grin. "And say that, Mr. Potter?"  Harry Potter's gaze went Granger, Draco. His face appeared calm; though Draco sure controlled would better term.  Finally Harry Potter spoke, voice level. "The Chaos Legion still happy accept traitors. See battlefield."  Draco knew shock showing face; astonished murmurs watching students, Draco glanced front row saw even Harry's Chaotics looked taken aback.  Granger's face angry, getting angrier. "Mr. Potter," said sharp tone like thought teacher, "are trying obnoxious?"  "Most certainly not," Harry Potter said calmly. "I make every time. Beat once, I'll stay beaten. But threats always enough, General Sunshine. You ask join you, tried simply impose will; sometimes must actually defeat enemy, impose him. You see, I skeptical Hermione Granger, brightest academic star Hogwarts, Draco, son Lucius, scion Noble Most Ancient House Malfoy, work together beat common foe, Harry Potter." An amused smile crossed Harry Potter's face. "Maybe I'll Draco tried Zabini, write letter Lucius Malfoy see thinks that."  "Harry!" gasped Granger, looking absolutely aghast, gasps audience well.  Draco controlled anger flushing him. That stupid move Harry's part, saying public. If Harry simply done it, might worked, Draco even thought that, Father would look like playing Harry's hands -  "If think father, Lord Malfoy, manipulated easily," Draco said coldly, "you surprise coming, Harry Potter."  And Draco realized words finished leaving mouth he'd backed father squarely corner, less without even meaning to. Father probably going like this, tiniest bit, would impossible say so... Draco would apologize that, honest accident, strange think he'd done all.  "Then go ahead defeat evil General Chaos," Harry said, still looking amused. "I can't win armies - really work together. But I wonder perhaps I could break then."  "You won't, we'll crush you!" said Draco Malfoy.  And beside him, Hermione Granger firmly nodded.  "Well," said Professor Quirrell astounded silence stretched while. "That I expected particular conversation go." The Defense Professor rather intrigued expression face. "Truthfully, Mr. Potter, I expected concede immediately smile, announce long since worked intended lesson decided spoil others. Indeed, I planned speech accordingly, Mr. Potter."  Harry Potter shrugged. "Sorry that," said, said nothing more.  "Oh, worry," said Professor Quirrell. "This, too, serve."  And Professor Quirrell turned three children, straightened podium address whole watching crowd; customary air detached amusement dropped away like falling mask, spoke voice amplified louder been.  "If Harry Potter," said Professor Quirrell, voice crisp cold December, "You-Know-Who would won."  The silence instant, total.   "Make mistake," said Professor Quirrell. "The Dark Lord winning. There fewer fewer Aurors dared face him, vigilantes opposed hunted down. One Dark Lord perhaps fifty Death Eaters winning country thousands. That beyond ridiculous! There grades low enough mark incompetence!"  There frown face Headmaster Dumbledore; faces audience, puzzlement; utter silence went on.  "Do understand happened? You saw today. I allowed traitors, gave generals means restrain them. You saw result. Clever plots clever betrayals, last soldier left battlefield shot himself! You cannot possibly doubt three armies could defeated outside foe unified within itself."  Professor Quirrell leaned forward podium, voice filled grim intensity. His right hand stretched out, fingers open spread. "Division weakness," said Defense Professor. His hand closed tight fist. "Unity strength. The Dark Lord understood well, whatever follies; used understanding create one simple invention made terrible Dark Lord history. Your parents faced one Dark Lord. And fifty Death Eaters perfectly unified, knowing breach loyalty would punished death, slack incompetence would punished pain. None could escape Dark Lord's grasp took Mark. And Death Eaters agreed take terrible Mark knew took it, would united, facing divided land. One Dark Lord fifty Death Eaters would defeated entire country, power Dark Mark."  Professor Quirrell's voice bleak hard. "Your parents could fought back kind. They not. There man named Yermy Wibble called upon nation institute draft, though quite vision enough propose Mark Britain. Yermy Wibble knew would happen him; hoped death would inspire others. So Dark Lord took family good measure. Their empty skins inspired nothing fear, one dared speak again. And parents would faced consequences despicable cowardice, saved one-year-old boy." Professor Quirrell's face showed full contempt. "A dramatist would called dei ex machina, nothing earn salvation. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named may deserved win, make doubt it, parents deserved lose."  The voice Defense Professor rang forth like iron. "And know this: parents learned nothing! The nation still fragmented weak! How decades passed Grindelwald You-Know-Who? Do think see next threat lifetimes? Will repeat follies parents, seen results clearly laid day? For I tell parents do, day darkness comes! I tell lesson learned! They learned hide like cowards nothing wait Harry Potter save them!"  There wondering look eyes Headmaster Dumbledore; students gazed Defense Professor bewilderment anger awe.  Professor Quirrell's eyes cold voice. "Mark this, mark well. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named wished rule country, hold cruel grasp forever. But least wished rule living country, heap ash! There Dark Lords mad, wished make world vast funeral pyre! There wars one whole country marched another! Your parents nearly lost half hundred, thought take country alive! How quickly would crushed foe numerous they, foe cared nothing destruction? This I foretell: When next threat rises, Lucius Malfoy claim must follow perish, hope trust cruelty strength. And though Lucius Malfoy believe it, lie. For Dark Lord perished, Lucius Malfoy unite Death Eaters, shattered instant, fled like whipped dogs betrayed other! Lucius Malfoy strong enough true Lord, Dark otherwise."  Draco Malfoy's fists clenched white, tears eyes, fury, unbearable shame.  "No," said Professor Quirrell, "I think Lucius Malfoy saves you. And lest think I speak behalf, time make clear soon enough so. I make recommendation, students. But I say whole country find leader strong Dark Lord, honorable pure, take Mark; could crush Dark Lord like insect, rest divided magical world could threaten them. And still greater enemy rose us war extermination, united magical world could survive."  There gasps, mostly Muggleborns; students green-trimmed robes looked merely puzzled. Now Harry Potter whose fists clenched tight trembling; Hermione Granger beside angry dismayed.  The Headmaster rose seat, face stern, saying word yet; command clear.  "I say threat come," said Professor Quirrell. "But live lives peace, past history world guide future. And future seen three armies day, cannot throw aside petty bickering take Mark single leader, indeed might wish Dark Lord lived rule you, regret day ever Harry Potter born -"  "Enough!" bellowed Albus Dumbledore.  There silence.  Professor Quirrell slowly turned head gaze Albus Dumbledore stood fury wizardry; eyes met, soundless stress pressed like weight upon students, listened daring move.  "You, too, failed country," said Professor Quirrell. "And know peril well I."  "Such speeches ears students," said Albus Dumbledore dangerously rising voice. "Nor mouths professors!"  Dryly, then, Professor Quirrell spoke: "There many speeches made ears adults, Dark Lord rose. And adults clapped cheered, went home enjoyed day's entertainment. But I obey you, Headmaster, make speeches like them. My lesson simple. I go nothing traitors, see students that, wait professors save them."  And Professor Quirrell turned back students, mouth quirked wry grin seemed dissipate dreadful pressure like god blowing scatter clouds. "But please kind traitors now," said Professor Quirrell. "They fun."  There laughter, though nervous first, seemed build, Professor Quirrell stood smiling wryly tension released itself.   Draco's mind still whirling thousand questions daze horror, Professor Quirrell prepared open envelopes three inscribed wishes.  It never occurred Draco moon-traveling Muggles greater threat slow decline wizardry, Father proven weak stop them.  And even stranger, obvious implication: Professor Quirrell believed Harry could. The Defense Professor claimed made recommendation, he'd mentioned Harry Potter over speech; others would already thinking thing Draco.  It ridiculous. The boy covered stuffed chair glitter called throne -  The boy faced Snape won, whispered traitorous voice, boy could grow Lord strong enough rule, strong enough save us -  Harry raised Muggles! He practically mudblood himself, fight adopted family -  He knows arts, secrets methods; take Muggles' science use them, alongside power wizards.  But refuses? What he's weak?  Then, said inner voice, you, it, Draco Malfoy?  And renewed hush crowd, Professor Quirrell opened first envelope.  "Mr. Malfoy," said Professor Quirrell, "your wish for... Slytherin win House Cup."  There puzzled pause watching audience.  "Yes, Professor," said Draco clear voice, knowing amplified. "If can't that, something else Slytherin -"  "I award House points unfairly," said Professor Quirrell. He tapped cheek, looking thoughtful. "Which makes wish difficult enough interesting. Would like say anything why, Mr. Malfoy?"  Draco turned Defense Professor, gazed crowd backdrop platinum emeralds. Not Slytherin cheered Dragon Army, anti-Malfoy factions expressed dissatisfaction supporting Boy-Who-Lived, even Granger; factions would encouraged greatly Zabini done. He needed remind Slytherin meant Malfoy Malfoy meant Slytherin -  "No," said Draco. "They're Slytherins, they'll understand."  There laughter audience, especially Slytherin, even students would called anti-Malfoy moment earlier.  Flattery lovely thing.  Draco turned back look Professor Quirrell again, surprised see embarrassed look Granger's face.  "And Miss Granger..." said Professor Quirrell. There sound tearing envelope. "Your wish for... Ravenclaw win House Cup?"  There considerable laughter audience, including chuckle Draco. He thought Granger played game.  "Well, um," said Granger, sounding like suddenly stumbling memorized speech, "I meant say, that..." She took deep breath. "There soldiers every House army, I mean slight them. But Houses still count something, too. It sad students House hexing different armies. People able rely whoever's House. That's Godric Gryffindor, Salazar Slytherin, Rowena Ravenclaw, Helga Hufflepuff created four Houses Hogwarts first place. I'm General Sunshine, even that, I'm Hermione Granger Ravenclaw, I'm proud part House that's eight hundred years old."  "Well said, Miss Granger!" said Dumbledore's booming voice.  Harry Potter frowning, something tickled edge Draco's recognition.  "An interesting sentiment, Miss Granger," said Professor Quirrell. "But times good Slytherin friends Ravenclaw, Gryffindor friends Hufflepuff. Surely would best could rely friends House, also friends army?"  Granger's eyes flicked briefly toward watching students teachers, said nothing.  Professor Quirrell nodded though himself, turned back podium, took tore open last envelope. Beside Draco, Harry Potter visibly tensed Defense Professor drew forth parchment. "And Mr. Potter wishes -"  There pause Professor Quirrell looked parchment.  Then, without change expression Professor Quirrell's face, sheet parchment burst flames, burned brief, intense fire left drifting black dust sprinkling hand.  "Please confine possible, Mr. Potter," said Professor Quirrell, sounding dry indeed.  There long pause; Harry, standing beside Draco, looked rather shaken.  What Merlin's name ask for?  "I hope," said Professor Quirrell, "that prepared another wish, I could grant one."  There another pause.  Harry drew deep breath. "I didn't," said, "but I already thought another one." Harry Potter turned look audience, voice firmed spoke. "People fear traitors damage traitor directly, soldiers shoot secrets tell. But that's part danger. What people they're afraid traitors also costs them. I used strategy today Sunshine Dragon. I tell traitors cause much direct damage possible. I told act way would create distrust confusion, make generals costly things try stop again. When traitors whole country opposing them, stands reason traitors might less damaging whole country stop them, cure might worse disease -"  "Mr. Potter," said Defense Professor, voice suddenly cutting, "the lesson history simply wrong. Your parents' generation little unify themselves, much! This whole country almost fell, Mr. Potter, though see it. I suggest ask dorm-mates Ravenclaw many lost family Dark Lord. Or wiser, ask! Do wish make, Mr. Potter?"  "If mind," said mild voice Albus Dumbledore, "I like hear Boy-Who-Lived say. He experience either us stopping wars."  A people laughed, many.  Harry Potter's gaze moved Dumbledore, looked considering moment. "I'm saying wrong, Professor Quirrell. In last war, people act together, whole country almost fell dozen attackers, yes, pathetic. And make mistake next time, yes, even pathetic. But never fight war twice. And problem is, enemy also allowed smart. If divided vulnerable one way; try unite, face risks, costs, enemy try take advantage those, too. You can't stop thinking one level game."  "Simplicity also great deal commend it, Mr. Potter," said dry voice Defense Professor. "I hope learned something day dangers strategies complicated uniting people attacking enemy. And tie wish somehow, I shall quite annoyed."  "Yes," said Harry Potter, "it pretty difficult coming wish symbolize costs unity. But problem acting together wars, something solve lives, every day. If everyone coordinating using rules, rules stupid, one person decides things differently, they're breaking rules. But everyone decides things differently, can. It's exactly problem everyone needing act together. But first person speaks out, seems like they're going crowd. And thought important thing people always unified, could never change game, matter stupid rules. So wish, symbolize happens people unite wrong direction, Hogwarts play Quidditch without Snitch."  "WHAT?" screamed hundred voices crowd, Draco's jaw dropped.  "The Snitch ruins whole game," said Harry Potter. "Everything players ends irrelevant. It would make overwhelmingly sense buy clock. It's one incredibly stupid things notice grew it, people everyone else -"  But point Harry Potter's voice could longer heard, riot started.   The riot ended around fifteen seconds later, gigantic spout fire blasted highest tower Hogwarts sound hundred thunders. Draco known Dumbledore could that.  The students sat carefully quietly.  Professor Quirrell laughing, without pause. "So it, Mr. Potter. Your done." The Defense Professor paused deliberately. "Of course, I promised one cunning plot. And three get."  Draco half-expecting words earlier, still came shock; Draco exchanged rapid glances Granger, would obvious allies wishes directly opposed -  "You mean," said Harry, "we agree wish?"  "Oh, would far much ask," said Professor Quirrell. "The three common enemy, you?"  And one brief moment, fast Draco thought might imagined it, Defense Professor's eyes flicked direction Dumbledore.  "No," said Professor Quirrell, "I mean I shall grant three wishes using single plot."  There confused silence.  "You can't that," Harry said flatly beside Draco. "Not even I that. Two wishes mutually incompatible. It's logically impossible -" Harry cut off.  "You're years young tell I can't do, Mr. Potter," said Professor Quirrell, brief dry smile.  Then Defense Professor turned back watching students. "Truthfully, I confidence ability learn day's lesson. Go home, enjoy time families, what's left them, still live. My family long since dead Dark Lord's hand. I shall see classes resume."  In speechless silence resulted, Professor Quirrell already turning walk stage, Draco heard Defense Professor's voice say, quietly longer amplified, "But you, Mr. Potter, I would speak now."   Chapter 35: Coordination Problems, Pt 3  They gone Defense Professor's office, Professor Quirrell sealed door leaned back chair spoke.  The Defense Professor's voice calm, unnerved Harry good deal Professor Quirrell shouting.  "I trying," said Professor Quirrell quietly, "to make allowances fact young. That I myself, age, quite extraordinary fool. You speak adult style meddle adult games, sometimes I forget meddler. I hope, Mr. Potter, childish meddling killed you, ruined country, lost next war."  It hard Harry control breathing. "Professor Quirrell, I said good deal less I wished say, I say something. Your proposals extremely alarming anyone slightest familiarity Muggle history last century. The Italian fascists, nasty people, got name fasces, bundle rods bound together symbolize idea unity strength -"  "So nasty Italian fascists believed unity stronger division," said Professor Quirrell. Sharpness beginning creep voice. "Perhaps also believed sky blue, advocated policy dropping rocks head."  Reversed stupidity intelligence; world's stupidest person may say sun shining, make dark out... "Fine, right, ad hominem argument, wrong fascists said it. But Professor Quirrell, can't everyone country take Mark one dictator! It's single point failure! Look, I'll put way. Suppose enemy Imperiuses whoever controls Mark -"  "Powerful wizards easy Imperius," said Professor Quirrell dryly. "And cannot find worthy leader, case doomed. But worthy leaders exist; question whether people shall follow them."  Harry raked hands hair frustration. He wanted call time-out make Professor Quirrell read The Rise Fall Third Reich start conversation again. "I suppose I suggested democracy better form government dictatorship -"  "I see," said Professor Quirrell. His eyes closed briefly, opened. "Mr. Potter, stupidity Quidditch transparent grow revering game. If never heard elections, Mr. Potter, simply saw there, saw would please you. Look elected Minister Magic. Is wisest, strongest, greatest nation? No; buffoon owned fee simple Lucius Malfoy. Wizards went polls chose Cornelius Fudge Tania Leach, competed grand entertaining contest Daily Prophet, Lucius Malfoy also controls, decided serious candidates. That Cornelius Fudge genuinely selected best leader country could offer suggestion anyone could make straight face. It different Muggle world, I heard seen; last Muggle newspaper I read mentioned previous President United States retired movie actor. If grown elections, Mr. Potter, would transparently silly Quidditch."  Harry sat mouth open, struggling words. "The point elections produce one best leader, keep politicians scared enough voters go completely evil like dictators -"  "The last war, Mr. Potter, fought Dark Lord Dumbledore. And Dumbledore flawed leader losing war, ridiculous suggest Ministers Magic elected period could taken Dumbledore's place! Strength flows powerful wizards followers, elections fools elect. That lesson magical Britain's recent history; I doubt next war teach lesson different. If survive it, Mr. Potter, unless abandon enthusiastic illusions childhood!"  "If think dangers course action advocate," said Harry, despite everything voice growing sharp, "then that, too, childish enthusiasm."  Harry stared grimly Professor Quirrell's eyes, stared back without blinking.  "Such dangers," said Professor Quirrell coldly, "are discussed offices like one, speeches. The fools elected Cornelius Fudge interested complications caution. Present anything nuanced rousing cheer, face war alone. That, Mr. Potter, childish error, Draco Malfoy would made even eight years old. It obvious even stayed silent, consulted first, spoken worries crowd!"  "I friend Albus Dumbledore," said Harry, cold voice match Professor Quirrell's. "But child, seem think concerns childish, I waited speak them."  "Oh," said Professor Quirrell, "so take cues Headmaster now, you?" stood behind desk.   When Blaise turned corner way office, saw Professor Quirrell already leaning wall.  "Blaise Zabini," said Defense Professor, straightening; eyes set like dark stones within face, voice sent shiver fear Blaise's spine.  He can't anything me, I remember -  "I believe," said Professor Quirrell, clear, cold voice, "that I already guessed name employer. But I would hear lips, tell also price bought you."  Blaise knew sweating robes, moisture would already visible forehead. "I got chance show I better three generals, I took it. A lot people hate now, there're also plenty Slytherins who'll love it. What makes think I'm -"  "You devise plan today's battle, Mr. Zabini. Tell did."  Blaise swallowed hard. "Well... I mean, case... already know did, right? The one who's crazy Dumbledore. And he'll protect try anything."  "Indeed. Tell price." The Defense Professor's eyes still hard.  "It's cousin Kimberly," Blaise said, swallowing trying control voice. "She's real, really bullied, Potter checked that, dumb. Only Dumbledore said he'd nudged bullies it, plan, I worked she'd fine afterward, I go Potter, trouble Kimberly could get into!"  Professor Quirrell silent long moment.  "I see," Professor Quirrell said, voice much milder. "Mr. Zabini, event occur again, may contact directly. I ways protecting friends. Now, final question: Even power took hands, forcing tie would difficult. Did Dumbledore instruct win otherwise?"  "Sunshine," said Blaise.  Professor Quirrell nodded. "As I thought." The Defense Professor sighed. "In future career, Mr. Zabini, I suggest trying plots complicated. They tendency fail."  "Um, I said Headmaster, actually," Blaise said, "and said important one plot going time."  Professor Quirrell passed weary hand across forehead. "It's wonder Dark Lord go mad fighting him. You may go meeting Headmaster, Mr. Zabini. I say nothing this, Headmaster somehow discover spoken, remember standing offer give protection I can. You dismissed."  Blaise wait word, turned fled.   Professor Quirrell waited time, said, "Go ahead, Mr. Potter."  Harry tore Cloak Invisibility head stuffed pouch. He trembing much rage could hardly speak. "He what? He what?"  "You deduced yourself, Mr. Potter," Professor Quirrell said mildly. "You must learn blur vision see forest obscured trees. Anyone heard stories you, know mysterious Boy-Who-Lived, could easily deduce ownership invisibility cloak. Step back events, blur away details, observe? There great rivalry students, competition ended perfect tie. That sort thing happens stories, Mr. Potter, one person school thinks stories. There strange complicated plot, realized uncharacteristic young Slytherin faced. But person school deals plots elaborate, name Zabini. And I warn quadruple agent; knew Zabini least triple agent, guessed high chance he. No, I declare battle invalid. All three failed test, lost common enemy."  Harry care tests point. "Dumbledore blackmailed Zabini threatening cousin? Just make battle end tie? Why?"  Professor Quirrell gave mirthless laugh. "Perhaps Headmaster thought rivalry good pet hero wished see continue. For greater good, understand. Or perhaps simply mad. You see, Mr. Potter, everyone knows Dumbledore's madness mask, sane pretending insane. They pride clever insight, knowing secret explanation, stop looking. It occur also possible mask behind mask, insane pretending sane pretending insane. And I afraid, Mr. Potter, I urgent business elsewhere, must depart; I strongly advise take cues Albus Dumbledore fighting war. Until later, Mr. Potter."  And Defense Professor inclined head irony, strode direction Zabini fled, Harry still standing open-mouthed shock.   Aftermath: Harry Potter.  Harry trudged slowly toward Ravenclaw dorm, eyes unseeing walls, paintings, students; went stairs ramps without slowing, speeding, noticing trod.  It taken minute Professor Quirrell's departure realize source information Dumbledore involved (a) Blaise Zabini, would absolute gaping idiot trust again, (b) Professor Quirrell, could easily faked plot Dumbledore's style, might also think little student rivalry fine thing; had, stepped back blurred details, proposed turning country magical dictatorship.  And also possible Dumbledore one behind Zabini, Professor Quirrell sincerely trying fight Dark Mark kind, prevent repetition performance saw pathetic. Trying make sure Harry end fighting Dark Lord alone, everyone else hid, frightened, trying stay line fire, waiting Harry save them.  But truth was...  Well...  Harry sort okay that.  It was, knew, kind thing supposed make heroes resentful bitter.  To heck that. Harry much favor everyone else staying danger Boy-Who-Lived took Dark Lord himself, plus minus small number companions. If next conflict Dark Lord got point Second Wizarding War killed lots people embroiled whole country, would mean Harry already failed.  And afterward war broke wizards Muggles, matter won, Harry would already failed letting get far. Besides, said societies peacefully integrate secrecy inevitably broke down? (Though Harry could hear Professor Quirrell's dry voice mind, asking fool, saying obvious things...) And mages Muggles live peace, Harry would combine magic science figure evacuate wizards Mars somewhere, instead letting war break out.  Because come war extermination...  That thing Professor Quirrell realized, one important question he'd forgotten ask young general.  The real reason Harry intention argued endorsing Light Mark, matter much would help fight Dark Lord.  One Dark Lord fifty Marked followers peril magical Britain.  If Britain took Mark strong leader, would peril whole magical world.  And whole wizarding world took single Mark, would danger rest humanity.  No one knew quite many wizards world. He'd done estimates Hermione come numbers rough range million.  But six billion Muggles.  If came final war...  Professor Quirrell forgotten ask Harry side would protect.  A scientific civilization, reaching outward, looking upward, knowing destiny grasp stars.  And magical civilization, slowly fading knowledge lost, still governed nobility saw Muggles quite human.  It terribly sad feeling, one held hint doubt.   Aftermath: Blaise Zabini.  Blaise strolled hallways careful, self-imposed slowness, heart beating wildly tried calm -  "Ahem," said dry, whispering voice shadowy alcove passed.  Blaise jumped, scream.  Slowly, turned.  In small, shadowy corner black cloak wide billowing impossible determine whether figure beneath male female, atop cloak broad-brimmed black hat, black mist seemed gather beneath obscure face whoever whatever might lie beneath.  "Report," whispered Mr. Hat Cloak.  "I said told to," said Blaise. His voice little calmer lying anyone. "And Professor Quirrell reacted way expected."  The broad black hat tilted straightened, though head nodded. "Excellent," said unidentifiable whisper. "The reward I promised already way mother, owl."  Blaise hesitated, curiosity eating alive. "Can I ask want cause trouble Professor Quirrell Dumbledore?" The Headmaster anything Gryffindor bullies Blaise knew about, besides helping Kimberly, Headmaster also offered make Professor Binns give excellent marks History Magic even turned blank parchments homework, though he'd still attend class pretend hand in. Actually Blaise would betrayed three generals free, never mind cousin either, he'd seen need say that.  The broad black hat cocked one side, convey quizzical stare. "Tell me, friend Blaise, occur traitors betray many times often meet ill ends?"  "Nope," said Blaise, looking straight black mist hat. "Everyone knows nothing really bad ever happens students Hogwarts."  Mr. Hat Cloak gave whispery chuckle. "Indeed," said whisper. "With murder one student five decades ago exception proves rule, since Salazar Slytherin would keyed monster ancient wards higher level Headmaster himself."  Blaise stared black mist, beginning feel little uneasy. But ought take Hogwarts professor anything significant without setting alarms. Quirrell Snape professors who'd something like this, Quirrell care fooling himself, Snape hurt one Slytherins... would he?  "No, friend Blaise," whispered black mist, "I wished advise never try anything like adult life. So many betrayals would certainly lead least one vengeance."  "My mother never got vengeances," said Blaise proudly. "Even though married seven husbands every single one died mysteriously left lots money."  "Really?" said whisper. "However persuade seventh marry heard happened first six?"  "I asked Mum that," said Blaise, "and said I know I old enough, I asked old old enough, said, older her."  Again whispery chuckle. "Well then, friend Blaise, congratulations followed mother's footsteps. Go, say nothing this, meet again."  Blaise backed uneasily away, feeling odd reluctance turn back.  The hat tilted. "Oh, come now, little Slytherin. If truly equal Harry Potter Draco Malfoy, would already realized hinted threats ensure silence Albus. Had I intended harm, I would hinted; I said nothing, worried."  Blaise straightened, feeling little insulted, nodded Mr. Hat Cloak; turned decisively strode toward meeting Headmaster.  He'd hoping end someone else would show give chance sell Mr. Hat Cloak.  But Mum betrayed seven different husbands time. When looked way, still better her.  And Blaise Zabini went walking toward Headmaster's office, smiling, content quintuple agent -  For moment boy stumbled, straightened, shaking odd feeling disorientation.  And Blaise Zabini went walking toward Headmaster's office, smiling, content quadruple agent.   Aftermath: Hermione Granger.  The messenger approach alone.  Hermione leaving girl's bathroom sometimes hid think, bright shining cat leaped nowhere said, "Miss Granger?"  She let little shriek realized cat spoken Professor McGonagall's voice.  Even frightened, startled; cat bright brilliant beautiful, glowing white silver radiance like moon-colored sunlight, imagine scared.  "What you?" said Hermione.  "This message Professor McGonagall," said cat, still Professor's voice. "Can come office, speak anyone?"  "I'll right away," said Hermione, still surprised, cat leaped vanished; vanish, traveled away somehow; mind said, even though eyes saw disappear.  By time Hermione got office favorite professor, mind a-whirl speculations. Was something wrong Transfiguration scores? But would Professor McGonagall say tell anyone? It probably Harry practicing partial Transfiguration...  Professor McGonagall's face looked worried, stern, Hermione seated front desk - trying keep eyes going nest cubbyholes containing Professor McGonagall's homework, she'd always wondered sort work grownups to keep school running whether could use help her...  "Miss Granger," said Professor McGonagall, "let start saying I already know Headmaster asking make wish -"  "He told you?" blurted Hermione startlement. The Headmaster said one else supposed know!  Professor McGonagall paused, looked Hermione, gave sad little chuckle. "It's good see Mr. Potter corrupted much. Miss Granger, supposed admit anything I say I know. As happens, Headmaster tell me, I simply know well."  Hermione blushing furiously now.  "It's fine, Miss Granger!" said Professor McGonagall hastily. "You're Ravenclaw first year, nobody expects Slytherin."  That really stung.  "Fine," said Hermione acerbity, "I'll go ask Harry Potter Slytherin lessons, then."  "That I wanted to..." said Professor McGonagall, voice trailed off. "Miss Granger, I'm worried young Ravenclaw girls Slytherins! If Headmaster asks get involved something comfortable with, Miss Granger, really right say no. And feeling pressured, please tell Headmaster would like there, would like ask first."  Hermione's eyes wide. "Does Headmaster things wrong?"  Professor McGonagall looked little sad that. "Not purpose, Miss Granger, I think... well, probably true sometimes Headmaster trouble remembering like child. Even child, I'm sure must brilliant, strong mind heart, courage enough three Gryffindors. Sometimes Headmaster asks much young students, Miss Granger, careful enough hurt them. He good man, sometimes plotting go far."  "But good students strong courage," said Hermione. "That's suggested Gryffindor me, it?"  Professor McGonagall smiled wryly. "Perhaps I selfish, wanting House. Did Sorting Hat offer - no, I asked."  "It told I might go anywhere Slytherin," said Hermione. She'd almost asked good enough Slytherin, she'd managed stop herself... "So I courage, Professor!"  Professor McGonagall leaned forward desk. The worry showing plainer face now. "Miss Granger, courage, what's healthy young girls! The Headmaster drawing plots, Harry Potter giving secrets keep, making alliances Draco Malfoy! And I promised mother would safe Hogwarts!"  Hermione know say that. But thought occurring Professor McGonagall might warning she'd boy Gryffindor instead girl Ravenclaw was, well... "I'll try good," said, "and I let anyone tell otherwise."  Professor McGonagall pressed hands eyes. When took away, lined face looked old. "Yes," said whisper, "you would done well House. Stay safe, Miss Granger, careful. And ever worried uncomfortable anything, please come once. I keep longer."   Aftermath, Draco Malfoy:  Neither really wanted anything complicated Saturday, fighting battle earlier. So Draco sitting unused classroom trying read book called Thinking Physics. It one fascinating things Draco ever read life, least parts could understand, least accursed idiot refused let books sight could manage shut let Draco concentrate -  "Hermione Granger muuudbloood," sang Harry Potter sat nearby desk, reading far advanced book own.  "I know trying do," said Draco calmly without looking pages. "It's going work. We're still ganging crushing you."  "A Maaaalfoy working muuudbloood, father's frieeeends think -"  "They'll think Malfoys easily manipulated seem believe, Potter!"  The Defense Professor crazier Dumbledore, future saviour world could ever childish undignified age.  "Hey, Draco, know what's really going suck? You know Hermione Granger two copies magical allele, like like me, classmates Slytherin know yooouuu're allowed explaaaaain -"  Draco's fingers whitening gripped book. Being beaten spat upon possibly require much self-control, get back Harry soon, going something incriminating -  "So wish first time?" said Draco.  Harry say anything, Draco looked book, felt twinge malicious satisfaction sad look Harry's face.  "Um," Harry said. "A lot people asked that, I think Professor Quirrell would wanted talk it."  Draco put serious look face. "You talk me. It's probably important compared secrets told me, else friends for?" That's right, I'm friend! Feel guilty!  "It really interesting," Harry said obviously artificial lightness. "Just, I wish Professor Quirrell would teach Battle Magic next year."  Harry sighed, looked back book.  And said, another seconds, "Your father's probably going pretty upset Christmas, promise betray mudblood girl wipe army, everything go back right, still get Christmas presents."  Maybe Granger asked Professor Quirrell extra politely used Quirrell points, two would allowed something interesting General Chaos putting sleep.   Chapter 36: Status Differentials  Wrenching disorientation, felt walk Platform Nine Three-Quarters rest Earth, world Harry thought real world. People dressed casual shirts pants, instead dignified robes wizards witches. Scattered bits trash around benches. A forgotten smell, fumes burned gasoline, raw sharp air. The ambiance King's Cross train station, less bright cheerful Hogwarts Diagon Alley; people seemed smaller, afraid, likely would eagerly traded problems dark wizard fight. Harry wanted cast Scourgify dirt, Everto garbage, he'd known spell, Bubble-Head Charm breathe air. But use wand, place...  This, Harry realized, must felt like go First World country Third World country.  Only Zeroth World Harry left, wizarding world, Cleansing Charms house elves; where, healer's arts magic, could hit one hundred seventy old age really started catching you.  And nonmagical London, Muggle Earth, Harry temporarily returned. This Mum Dad would live rest lives, unless technology leapfrogged wizardry's quality life, something deeper world changed.  Without even thinking it, Harry's head turned eyes darted behind see wooden trunk scurrying him, unnoticed Muggles, clawed tentacles offering quick confirmation that, yes, imagined all...  And reason tight feeling chest.  His parents know.  They know anything.  They know...  "Harry?" called thin, blonde woman whose perfectly smooth unblemished skin made look good deal younger thirty-three; Harry realized start magic, known signs could see now. And whatever sort potion lasted long, must terribly dangerous, witches themselves, desperate...  There water gathering Harry's eyes.  "Harry?" yelled older-looking man paunch gathering stomach, dressed ostentatious academic carelessness black vest thrown dark grey-green shirt, someone would always professor anywhere went, would certainly one brilliant wizards generation, he'd born two copies gene, instead zero...  Harry raised hand waved them. He speak. He speak all.  They came him, running, steady, dignified walk; fast Professor Michael Verres-Evans walked, Mrs. Petunia Evans-Verres walk faster.  The smile father's face wide, father never given huge smiles; was, least, wide Harry ever seen it, wider new grant came in, one students got position, ask wider smile that.  Mum blinking hard, trying smile good job.  "So!" said father came striding up. "Made revolutionary discoveries yet?"  Of course Dad thought joking.  It hurt quite much parents believe him, back one else believed either, back Harry known felt taken seriously people like Headmaster Dumbledore Professor Quirrell.  And Harry realized Boy-Who-Lived existed magical Britain, person Muggle London, cute little eleven-year-old boy going home Christmas.  "Excuse me," Harry said, voice trembling, "I'm going break cry now, mean anything wrong school."  Harry started move forward, stopped, torn hugging father hugging mother, want either one feel slighted Harry loved -  "You," said father, "are silly boy, Mr. Verres," gently took Harry shoulders pushed arms mother, kneeling down, tears already streaking cheek.  "Hello, Mum," Harry said voice wavering, "I'm back." And hugged her, amid noisy mechanical sounds smell burned gasoline; Harry started crying, knew nothing could go back, least him.   The sky completely dark, stars coming out, time negotiated Christmas traffic university town Oxford, parked driveway small, dingy-looking old house family used keep rain books.  As walked brief stretch pavement leading front door, passed series flower-pots holding small, dim electric lights (dim since recharge solar power day), lights lit passed. The hard part finding motion sensors waterproof triggered right distance...  In Hogwarts real torches like that.  And front door opened Harry stepped living-room, blinking hard.  Every inch wall space covered bookcase. Each bookcase six shelves, going almost ceiling. Some bookshelves stacked brim hardcover books: science, math, history, everything else. Other shelves two layers paperback science fiction, back layer books propped old tissue boxes two-by-fours, see back layer books books front. And still enough. Books overflowing onto tables sofas making little heaps windows...  The Verres household he'd left it, books, also he'd left it.  And Christmas tree, naked undecorated two days Christmas Eve, threw Harry briefly realized, warm feeling blossoming chest, course parents waited.  "We took bed room make room bookcases," said father. "You sleep trunk, right?"  "You sleep trunk," said Harry.  "That reminds me," said father. "What end sleep cycle?"  "Magic," Harry said, making beeline door opened upon bedroom, case Dad joking...  "That's explanation!" said Professor Verres-Evans, Harry shouted, "You used open space bookcases?"   Harry spent 23rd December shopping Muggle things Transfigure; father busy said Harry would need walk take bus, suited Harry fine. Some people hardware store given Harry questioning looks, he'd said innocent voice father shopping nearby busy sent get things (holding list carefully adult-looking half-illegible handwriting); end, money money.  They decorated Christmas tree together, Harry put tiny dancing fairy top (two Sickles, five Knuts Gambol & Japes).  Gringotts readily exchanged Galleons paper money, seem simple way turn larger quantities gold tax-free, unsuspicious Muggle money numbered Swiss bank account. This rather spiked Harry's plan turn money he'd self-stolen sensible mix 60% international index funds 40% Berkshire Hathaway. For moment, Harry diversified assets little sneaking late night, invisible Time-Turned, burying one hundred golden Galleons backyard. He'd always always always wanted anyway.  Some December 24th spent Professor reading Harry's books asking questions. Most experiments father suggested impractical, least moment; remaining, Harry done many already. ("Yes, Dad, I checked happened Hermione given changed pronunciation know whether changed, first experiment I did, Dad!")  The last question Harry's father asked, looking Magical Draughts Potions expression bewildered disgust, whether made sense wizard; Harry answered no.  Whereupon father declared magic unscientific.  Harry still little shocked idea pointing section reality calling unscientific. Dad seemed think conflict intuitions universe meant universe problem.  (Then again, lots physicists thought quantum mechanics weird, instead quantum mechanics normal weird.)  Harry shown mother healer's kit he'd bought keep house, though potions work Dad. Mum stared kit way made Harry ask whether Mum's sister ever bought anything like Grandpa Edwin Grandma Elaine. And Mum still answered, Harry said hastily must never thought it. And then, finally, he'd fled room.  Lily Evans probably thought it, sad thing. Harry knew people tendency not-think painful subjects, way tendency deliberately rest hands red-hot stove burners; Harry starting suspect Muggleborns rapidly acquired tendency not-think family, going die reached first century anyway.  Not Harry intention letting happen, course.  And late day December 24th driving Christmas Eve dinner.   The house huge, Hogwarts standards, certainly standards could get father distinguished professor trying live Oxford. Two stories brick gleaming setting sun, windows top windows one tall window went much glass go, going one huge living room...  Harry took deep breath, rang doorbell.  There distant call "Honey, get it?"  This followed slow patter approaching steps.  And door opened reveal genial man, fat rosy cheeks thinning hair, blue button-down shirt straining slightly seams.  "Dr. Granger?" Harry's father said briskly, Harry could even speak. "I'm Michael, Petunia son Harry. The food's magical trunk," Dad made vague gesture behind - quite direction trunk, happened.  "Yes, please, come in," said Leo Granger. He stepped forward took wine bottle Professor's outstretched hands, muttered "Thank you," stepped back waved living room. "Have seat. And," head turning address Harry, "all toys downstairs basement, I'm sure Herm shortly, first door right," pointed toward hallway.  Harry looked moment, conscious blocking parents coming in.  "Toys?" said Harry bright, high-pitched voice, eyes wide. "I love toys!"  There intake breath mother behind him, Harry strode house, managing stomp hard walked.  The living room every bit large looked outside, huge vaulted ceiling dangling gigantic chandelier, Christmas tree must murder maneuver door. The lower levels tree thoroughly carefully decorated neat patterns red green gold, newfound sprinkling blue bronze; heights grownup could reach carelessly, randomly draped strings lights wreaths tinsel. A hallway extended terminated cabinetry kitchen, wooden stairs polished metal railings stretched toward second floor.  "Gosh!" Harry said. "This big house! I hope I get lost here!"   Dr. Roberta Granger feeling rather nervous dinner approached. The turkey roast, contributions common project, steadily cooking away oven; dishes brought guests, Verres family, adopted boy named Harry. Who known wizarding world Boy-Who-Lived. And also boy Hermione ever called "cute", noticed all, really.  The Verreses said Hermione child Harry's age group whose existence son ever acknowledged way whatsoever.  And might've jumping gun little; couples sneaking suspicion wedding bells might offing years road.  So Christmas Day would spent, always, husband's family, they'd decided spend Christmas Eve meeting daughter's possible future in-laws.  The doorbell rang right middle basting turkey, raised voice shouted, "Honey, get it?"  There brief groan chair occupant, sound husband's heavy footsteps door swinging open.  "Dr. Granger?" said older man's brisk voice. "I'm Michael, Petunia son Harry. The food's magical trunk."  "Yes, please, come in," said husband, followed muttered "Thank you" indicated sort present accepted, "Have seat." Then Leo's voice altered tone artificial enthusiasm, said, "And toys downstairs basement, I'm sure Herm shortly, first door right."  There brief pause.  Then young boy's bright voice said, "Toys? I love toys!"  There sound footsteps entering house, bright voice said, "Gosh! This big house! I hope I get lost here!"  Roberta closed oven, smiling. She'd bit worried way Hermione's letters described Boy-Who-Lived - though certainly daughter said anything indicating Harry Potter dangerous; nothing like dark hints written books Roberta bought, supposedly Hermione, trip Diagon Alley. Her daughter said much all, Harry talked like came book, Hermione studying harder ever life stay ahead class. But sound it, Harry Potter ordinary eleven-year-old boy.  She got front door daughter came clattering frantically stairs speed look safe all, Hermione claimed witches resistant falls Roberta quite sure believed -  Roberta took first sight Professor Mrs. Verres, looking rather nervous, boy legendary scar forehead turned daughter said, lower voice, "Well met fairest evenings, Miss Granger." His hand stretched back, though offering parents silver platter. "I present father, Professor Michael Verres-Evans, mother, Mrs. Petunia Evans-Verres."  And Roberta's mouth gaping open, boy turned back parents said, bright voice again, "Mum, Dad, Hermione! She's really smart!"  "Harry!" hissed daughter. "Stop that!"  The boy swiveled regard Hermione. "I'm afraid, Miss Granger," boy said gravely, "that I exiled labyrinthine recesses basement. Let us leave adult conversations, would doubt soar far childish intellects, resume ongoing discussion implications Humean projectivism Transfiguration."  "Excuse us, please," said daughter firm tone, grabbed boy left sleeve, dragged hallway - Roberta swiveled helplessly track went past her, boy gave cheery wave - Hermione pulled boy basement access slammed door behind her.  "I, ah, I apologize for..." said Mrs. Verres faltering voice.  "I'm sorry," said Professor, smiling fondly, "Harry bit touchy sort thing. But I expect he's right us interested conversation."  Is dangerous? Roberta wanted ask, kept silence tried think subtler questions. Her husband beside chuckling, he'd found they'd seen funny, rather frightening.  The terrible Dark Lord history tried kill boy, burnt husk body found next crib.  Her possible future son-in-law.  Roberta increasingly apprehensive giving daughter witchcraft - especially she'd read books, put dates together, realized magical mother probably killed height Grindelwald's terror, died giving birth father always claimed. But Professor McGonagall made visits first trip, "see Miss Granger doing"; Roberta help think Hermione said parents troublesome witching career, something would done fix them...  Roberta put best smile face, could spread pretended Christmas cheer.   The dining room table much longer six people - er, four people two children - really needed, draped tablecloth fine white linen, dishes needlessly transferred fancy serving plates, least stainless steel rather real silver.  Harry bit trouble concentrating turkey.  The conversation turned Hogwarts, naturally; it'd obvious Harry parents hoping Hermione would trip say Harry's school life Harry telling them. And either Hermione realized this, automatically steering clear anything might prove troublesome.  So Harry fine.  But unfortunately Harry made mistake owling parents sorts facts Hermione told parents.  Like general army after-school activities.  Hermione's mother looked alarmed, Harry quickly interrupted done best explain spells stunners, Professor Quirrell always watching, existence magical healing meant lots things much less dangerous sounded, point Hermione kicked hard table. Thankfully Harry's father, Harry admit better things, announced firm professorial authority worried all, since imagine children allowed dangerous.  That Harry trouble enjoying dinner, though.  ...the problem feeling sorry never took time find someone else worse.  Dr. Leo Granger asked, one point, whether nice teacher who'd seemed like Hermione, Professor McGonagall, awarding lots points school.  Hermione said yes, apparently genuine smile.  Harry managed, effort, stop icily pointing Professor McGonagall would never show favoritism Hogwarts student, Hermione getting lots points she'd earned every, single, one.  At another point, Leo Granger offered table opinion Hermione smart could gone medical school become dentist, whole witch business.  Hermione smiled again, quick glance prevented Harry suggesting Hermione might also internationally famous scientist, asking whether thought would've occurred Grangers they'd son instead daughter, unacceptable either way offspring better them.  But Harry rapidly reaching boiling point.  And becoming lot appreciative fact father always done everything could support Harry's development prodigy always encouraged reach higher never belittled single one accomplishments, even child prodigy still child. Was sort household could ended in, Mum married Vernon Dursley?  Harry could, though.  "And really beating classes except broomstick riding Transfiguration?" said Professor Michael Verres-Evans.  "Yes," Harry said forced calm, cut another bite Christmas Eve turkey. "By solid margins, them." There circumstances Harry would reluctant admit that, gotten around telling father now.  "Hermione always quite good school," said Dr. Leo Granger satisfied tone.  "Harry competes national level!" said Professor Michael Verres-Evans.  "Dear!" said Petunia.  Hermione giggling, making Harry feel better situation. It seem bother Hermione bothered Harry.  "I'm embarrassed lose her, Dad," Harry said. Right moment wasn't. "Did I mention memorized schoolbooks first day class? And yes, I tested it."  "Is that, ah, usual her?" Professor Verres-Evans said Grangers.  "Oh, yes, Hermione's always memorizing things," said Dr. Roberta Granger cheerful smile. "She knows every recipe cookbooks heart. I miss every time I make dinner."  Judging look father's face, Dad feeling least Harry felt.  "Don't worry, Dad," Harry said, "she's getting advanced material take, now. Her teachers Hogwarts know smart, unlike parents!"  His voice risen last three words, even faces turned stare Hermione kicked again, Harry knew he'd blown it, much, way much.  "Of course know smart," said Leo Granger, starting look offended child who'd temerity raise voice dinner table.  "You tiniest idea," said Harry, ice leaking voice. "You think reads lot books cute, right? You see perfect report card think good well class. Your daughter talented witch generation brightest star Hogwarts, someday, Dr. Dr. Granger, fact parents reason history remembers you!"  Hermione, calmly got seat walked around table, chose moment grab Harry's shirt shoulder pull chair. Harry let pulled, Hermione dragged away, said, raising voice even louder, "It entirely possible thousand years, fact Hermione Granger's parents dentists reason anyone remembers dentistry!"   Roberta stared daughter dragged Boy-Who-Lived room patient look upon young face.  "I'm terribly sorry," said Professor Verres amused smile. "But please worry, Harry always talks like that. Aren't like married couple already?"  The frightening thing were.   Harry expecting rather severe lecture Hermione.  But Hermione pulled basement access closed door behind them, she'd turned around -  - smiling, genuinely far Harry could tell.  "Please don't, Harry," said soft voice. "Even though nice you. Everything's fine."  Harry looked her. "How stand it?" said. He keep voice quiet, want parents hear, rose pitch volume. "How stand it?"  Hermione shrugged, said, "Because that's way parents be?"  "No," Harry said, voice low intense, "it's not, father never puts - well, does, never like -"  Hermione held single finger, Harry waited, watching search words. It took said, "Harry... Professor McGonagall Professor Flitwick like I'm talented witch generation brightest star Hogwarts. And Mum Dad know that, never able tell them, love anyway. Which means everything way be, Hogwarts home. And since they're parents, Mr. Potter, get argue." She smiling mysterious smile dinnertime, looking Harry fondly. "Is clear, Mr. Potter?"  Harry nodded tightly.  "Good," said Hermione, leaned kissed cheek.   The conversation gotten started distant high-pitched yelp floated back them,  "Hey! No kissing!"  The two fathers burst laughter two mothers rose chairs identical looks horror dashed toward basement.  When children brought back, Hermione saying icy tone never going kiss Harry ever again, Harry saying outraged voice Sun would burn cold dead cinder let get close enough try.  Which meant everything way be, sat back finish Christmas dinner.   Chapter 37: Interlude: Crossing Boundary  It almost midnight.  Staying late simple enough Harry. He used Time-Turner. Harry followed tradition timing sleep cycle make sure awake Christmas Eve turned Christmas Day; he'd never young enough believe Santa Claus, he'd young enough doubt.  It would nice mysterious figure entered house night brought presents...  A chill went Harry's spine then.  An intimation something dreadful approaching.  A creeping terror.  A sense doom.  Harry sat bolt upright bed.  He looked window.  "Professor Quirrell?" Harry shrieked quietly.  Professor Quirrell made slight lifting gesture, Harry's window seemed fold frame. At cold gust winter blew room gap, along scant flakes snow sky spotted grey night-clouds, amid black stars.  "Fear not, Mr. Potter," said Defense Professor normal voice. "I Charmed parents asleep; shall wake I departed."  "No one's supposed know I am!" said Harry, still keeping shriek quiet. "Even owls supposed deliver mail Hogwarts, here!" Harry agreed willingly; would silly Death Eater could win whole war time owling magically triggered hand grenade.  Professor Quirrell grinning, stood backyard beyond window. "Oh, I worry, Mr. Potter. You well protected locating Charms, blood purist likely think consulting phone book." His grin grew wider. "And take considerable effort cross wards Headmaster put around house - though course anyone knew address could simply wait outside attack next time left."  Harry stared Professor Quirrell while. "What here?" Harry said finally.  The smile left Professor Quirrell's face. "I've come apologize, Mr. Potter," Defense Professor said quietly. "I spoken harshly I -"  "Don't," Harry said. He looked blanket clutching around pajamas. "Just don't."  "Have I offended much?" said Professor Quirrell's quiet voice.  "No," Harry said. "But apologize."  "I see," said Professor Quirrell, instant voice grew stern. "Then I treat equal, Mr. Potter, I say gravely violated etiquette holds friendly Slytherins. If currently playing game someone, must meddle plans like that, without asking before. For know true design may be, stakes may lose. It would mark enemy, Mr. Potter."  "I'm sorry," Harry said, quiet tone Professor Quirrell used.  "Apology accepted," said Professor Quirrell.  "But," Harry said, still quietly, "you I really must speak politics, point."  Professor Quirrell sighed. "I know dislike condescension, Mr. Potter -"  That bit understatement.  "But would even condescending," said Professor Quirrell, "if I state clearly. You missing life experience, Mr. Potter."  "And everyone sufficient life experience agree you, then?" said Harry calmly.  "What good life experience someone plays Quidditch?" said Professor Quirrell, shrugged. "I think change mind time, every trust place failed you, become cynical."  The Defense Professor said though ordinary statement world, framed black stars cloud-spotted sky, one two tiny snowflakes blew past biting winter air.  "That reminds me," said Harry. "Merry Christmas."  "I suppose," said Professor Quirrell. "After all, apology, must Christmas gift. The first one I ever given, fact."  Harry even started yet learning Latin could read experimental diary Roger Bacon; hardly dared open mouth ask.  "Put winter coat," said Professor Quirrell, "or take warming potion one; meet outside, stars. I shall see I maintain little longer time."  It took Harry moment process words, dashing coat closet.  Professor Quirrell kept spell starlight going hour, though Defense Professor's face grew strained, sit while. Harry protested once, shushed.  They crossed boundary Christmas Eve Christmas Day within timeless void Earthly rotations meant nothing, one true everlasting Silent Night.  And promised, Harry's parents slept soundly it, Harry safely back room, Defense Professor gone.   Chapter 38: The Cardinal Sin  Bright sun, bright air, bright students bright parents, clean paved ground Platform 9.75, winter Sun hanging low sky 9:45AM morning January 5th, 1992. Some younger students wore scarves mittens, simply wore robes; wizards, all.  After Harry moved away landing platform, took scarf coat, opened compartment trunk, stowed away winter things.  For long moment, stood letting January air bite him, see like.  Harry took wizards' robes, shrugged on.  And finally, Harry drew wand; help thinking parents he'd kissed goodbye, world whose problems leaving behind...  With strange feeling guilt unavoidable, Harry said, "Thermos."  The warmth flowed him.  And Boy-Who-Lived back.  Harry yawned stretched, feeling lethargic anything else conclusion vacation. He feel like reading textbooks, even serious science fiction, morning; needed something completely frivolous occupy attention...  Well, hard come by, willing part four Knuts.  Besides, Daily Prophet corrupt Quibbler competing newspaper, might suppressed real news there.  Harry trudged back newsstand last time, wondering Quibbler could top headline he'd seen before.  The vendor started smile Harry approached, man's face suddenly changed, caught sight scar.  "Harry Potter?" gasped vendor.  "No, Mr. Durian," said Harry, eyes dipping briefly man's nametag, "just amazing imitation -"  And Harry's voice stopped throat, caught sight top fold Quibbler.  SLOSHED SEER SPILLS SECRETS:   DARK LORD TO RETURN,  For instant, Harry tried clamp face, realizing shocked could revealing, sense -  "Excuse me," Harry said. His voice sounded little alarmed, even know whether revealing, normal reaction would know anything. He'd spent much time around Slytherins, forgetting keep secrets ordinary people. Four Knuts hit counter. "One copy Quibbler, please."  "Oh, worries, Mr. Potter!" said vendor hastily, waving hands. "It's - never mind, -"  A newspaper flew air hit Harry's fingers, unfolded it.  SLOSHED SEER SPILLS SECRETS:   DARK LORD TO RETURN,   WED DRACO MALFOY  "It's free," said vendor, "for you, I mean -"  "No," Harry said, "I going buy one anyway."  The vendor took coins, Harry read on.  "Gosh," Harry said half minute later, "you get seer smashed six slugs Scotch spills sorts secret stuff. I mean, who'd thought Sirius Black Peter Pettigrew secretly person?"  "Not me," said vendor.  "They've even got picture two together, know that's secretly person."  "Yup," said vendor. "Pretty clever disguise, innit?"  "And I'm secretly sixty-five years old."  "You look half that," vendor said amiably.  "And I'm betrothed Hermione Granger, Bellatrix Black, Luna Lovegood, oh yes, Draco Malfoy too..."  "Goin' ter one interesting wedding," said vendor.  Harry looked newspaper, said pleasant voice, "You know, I heard first Luna Lovegood insane, I wondered really was, making stuff giggling whole time. Then I read second Quibbler headline, I decided insane, I mean, can't easy make stuff up, accident. And know I think? I think must mad all. When ordinary people try make stuff up, come like this. Something's got go really wrong inside head comes start making stuff up!"  The vendor stared Harry.  "Seriously," said Harry. "Who reads stuff?"  "You," said vendor.  Harry wandered read newspaper.  He sit nearby table he'd sat Draco, first time he'd prepared board train. That seemed like tempting history repeat itself.  It first week Hogwarts been, judging Quibbler, fifty-four years long. It that, Harry's humble opinion, life need new threads complexity.  So Harry found small iron chair somewhere else, distant main crowd occasional muffled cracks parents Apparating children, sat read Quibbler see contained suppressed news.  And besides obvious craziness (heaven help real) good deal snide romantic gossip; nothing would really important true.  Harry reading Ministry's proposed marriage law, ban marriages, -  "Harry Potter," said silken voice sent shock adrenaline jolting Harry's blood.  Harry looked up.  "Lucius Malfoy," Harry said, voice weary. Next time going smart thing, wait outside Muggle part King's Cross 10:55am.  Lucius inclined head courteously, sending long white hair drifting shoulders. The man still carrying cane, lacquered black silver snake's head handle; something grip silently said weapon deadly power, I feeble leaning this. His face expressionless.  Two men flanked him, eyes continuously scanning, wands already gripped low hands. The two moved like single organism four legs four arms, senior Crabbe-and-Goyle, Harry thought could guess which, really matter. They merely Lucius's appendages, certainly they'd two rightmost toes left foot.  "I apologize disturbing you, Mr. Potter," said smooth, silken voice. "But answered none owls; this, I thought, might opportunity meet you."  "I received none owls," Harry said calmly. "Dumbledore intercepted them, I presume. But I would answered I had, except Draco. For deal directly, without Draco's knowledge, would trespass friendship."  Please go away, please go away...  The grey eyes glittered him. "Is pose, then..." said senior Malfoy. "Well. I shall play along little. What purpose maneuvering good friend, son, public alliance girl?"  "Oh," Harry said lightly, "that's obvious, right? Draco's working Granger make realize Muggleborns human all. Bwa. Ha. Ha."  A thin trace smile moved Lucius's lips. "Yes, sound like one Dumbledore's plans. Which not."  "Indeed," said Harry. "It part game Draco, work Dumbledore's, I say."  "Let us dispense games," said senior Malfoy, grey eyes suddenly hardening. "If suspicions true, would hardly Dumbledore's bidding case, Mr. Potter."  There slight pause.  "So know," Harry said, voice cold. "Tell me. At point, exactly, realize?"  "When I read response Professor Quirrell's little speech," said white-haired man, chuckled grimly. "I puzzled, first, seemed interest; took days understand whose interest served, finally became clear. And also obvious weak, ways others."  "Very clever you," said Harry, still cold. "But perhaps mistake interests."  "Perhaps I do." A hint steel came silken voice. "Indeed, precisely I fear. You playing strange games son, purpose I cannot guess. That friendly act, cannot expect concerned!"  Lucius leaning upon cane hands now, hands white, bodyguards suddenly tensed.  Some instinct within Harry claimed would bad idea show fear, let Lucius see could intimidated. They public train station anyway -  "I find interesting," Harry said, putting steel voice, "that think I could benefit Draco harm. But irrelevant, Lucius. He friend, I betray friends."  "What?" whispered Lucius. His face showed sheer shock.  Then -  "Company," said one minions, Harry thought, voice, must senior Crabbe.  Lucius straightened turned, let hiss disapproval.  Neville approaching, looking scared determined, tow behind tall woman look scared all.  "Madam Longbottom," Lucius said icily.  "Mr. Malfoy," returned woman equal ice. "Are annoyance Harry Potter?"  The bark laughter came Lucius seemed strangely bitter. "Oh, I rather think not. Come protect me, you?" The white-haired head shifted toward Neville. "And would Mr. Potter's loyal lieutenant, last scion Longbottom, Neville, self-styled Chaos. How strangely world turn. Sometimes I think must mad."  Harry idea say that, Neville looked confused, frightened.  "I doubt world mad," said Madam Longbottom. Her voice took gloating tone. "You seem poor mood, Mr. Malfoy. Did speech dear Professor Quirrell cost allies?"  "It clever enough slander abilities," Lucius said coldly, "though effective upon fools believe I truly Death Eater."  "What?" blurted Neville.  "I Imperius, young man," said Lucius, sounding tired. "The Dark Lord could hardly begun recruiting among pureblood families without support House Malfoy. I demurred, simply made sure me. His Death Eaters know afterward, hence false Mark I bear; though since I truly consent, bind me. Some Death Eaters still believe I foremost among number, peace nation I let believe it, keep controlled. But I fool support ill-fated adventurer choice -"  "Ignore him," Madam Longbottom said, instruction addressed Harry well Neville. "He must spend rest life pretending, fear testimony Veritaseum." Said malicious satisfaction.  Lucius turned back dismissively, faced Harry again. "Will request harridan depart, Mr. Potter?"  "I think not," said Harry dry voice. "I prefer deal part House Malfoy that's age."  There long pause, then. The grey eyes searched him.  "Of course..." said Lucius slowly. "I feel fool now. This whole time pretending idea talking about."  Harry met gaze, said nothing.  Lucius raised cane centimeters struck hard ground.  The world vanished pale haze, sounds went quiet, nothing universe Harry Lucius Malfoy snake-headed cane.  "My son heart," said senior Malfoy, "the last worthwhile thing I left world, I say spirit friendship: come harm, I would give life vengeance. But long son come harm, I wish best luck endeavors. And asked nothing me, I ask nothing you."  Then pale haze vanished, showing outraged Madam Longbottom blocked moving forward senior Crabbe; wand hand, now.  "How dare you!" hissed.  Lucius's dark robes swirled around him, white hair, turned senior Goyle. "We return Malfoy Manor."  There three pops Apparition, gone.  A silence followed.  "Dear heavens," said Madam Longbottom. "What about?"  Harry shrugged helplessly. Then looked Neville.  There sweat Neville's forehead.  "Thank much, Neville," said Harry. "Your help greatly appreciated, Neville. And now, Neville, I think sit down."  "Yes, General," said Neville, instead coming one chairs near Harry, semi-collapsed sitting position pavement.  "You wrought many changes grandson," said Madam Longbottom. "I approve some, others."  "Send list which," said Harry. "I'll see I do."  Neville groaned, said nothing.  Madam Longbottom gave chuckle. "I shall, young man, thank you." Her voice lowered. "Mr. Potter... speech given Professor Quirrell something nation long needed hear. I cannot say much comment it."  "I take opinion advisement," Harry said mildly.  "I dearly hope do," said Madam Longbottom, turned back grandson. "Do I still need -"  "It's okay go, Granma," said Neville. "I'll fine own, time."  "Now I approve of," said, popped vanished like soap bubble.  The two boys sat quietly moment.  Neville spoke first, voice weary. "You're going try fix changes approves of, right?"  "Not them," Harry said innocently. "I want make sure I'm corrupting you."   Draco looked worried. His head kept darting around, despite fact Draco insisted going Harry's trunk, using true Quieting Charm sound-blurring barrier.  "What say Father?" blurted Draco, moment Quieting Charm went sounds Platform 9 3/4 vanished.  "I... look, tell said you, dropped off?" said Harry.  "That I tell right away seemed threatening me," said Draco. "That I tell right away anything I could pose threat you! Father thinks dangerous, Harry, whatever said today scared him! It's good idea scare Father!"  Oh, hell...  "What talk about?" demanded Draco.  Harry leaned back wearily small folding chair sat bottom trunk's cavern. "You know, Draco, fundamental question rationality 'What I think I know I think I know it?', there's also cardinal sin, way thinking that's opposite that. Like ancient Greek philosophers. They clue going on, they'd go around saying things like 'All water' 'All fire', never asked themselves, 'Wait minute, even everything water, could I possibly know that?' They ask evidence discriminated possibility possibilities could imagine, evidence they'd unlikely encounter theory true -"  "Harry," Draco said, voice strained, "What talk Father?"  "I know, actually," said Harry, "so important I make stuff -"  Harry never heard Draco shriek horror quite high pitch before.   Chapter 39: Pretending Wise, Pt 1  Whistle. Tick. Bzzzt. Ding. Glorp. Pop. Splat. Chime. Toot. Puff. Tinkle. Bubble. Beep. Thud. Crackle. Whoosh. Hiss. Pffft. Whirr.  Professor Flitwick silently passed Harry folded parchment Charms class Monday, note said Harry visit Headmaster convenience fashion one else would notice, especially Draco Malfoy Professor Quirrell. His one-time password gargoyle would "squeamish ossifrage". This accompanied remarkably artistic ink drawing Professor Flitwick staring sternly, eyes occasionally blinked; bottom note, underlined three times, phrase DON'T GET INTO TROUBLE.  And Harry finished Transfiguration class, studied Hermione, eaten dinner, spoken lieutenants, finally, clock struck nine, turned invisible dropped back 6PM wearily trudged toward gargoyle, turning spiral stairs, wooden door, room full little fiddly things, silver-bearded figure Headmaster.  This time, Dumbledore looked quite serious, customary smile absent; dressed pajamas darker sober purple usual.  "Thank coming, Harry," said Headmaster. The old wizard rose throne, began slowly pace room strange devices. "First, notes yesterday's encounter Lucius Malfoy?"  "Notes?" blurted Harry.  "Surely wrote down..." said old wizard, voice trailed off.  Harry felt rather embarrassed. Yes, fumbled mysterious conversation full significant hints understand, bloody obvious thing would write immediately afterward, memory faded, could try figure later.  "All right," said Headmaster, "from memory then."  Harry sheepishly recited best could, got almost halfway realized smart go around telling possibly-crazy Headmaster everything, least without thinking first, Lucius definitely bad guy Dumbledore's opponent probably good idea tell him, Harry already started talking late try calculate things now...  Harry finished recollections honestly.  Dumbledore's face grown remote Harry went on, end look ancientness him, sternness air.  "Well," said Dumbledore. "I suggest take best care heir Malfoy come harm, then. And I same." The Headmaster frowning, fingers drumming soundlessly inky black surface plate inscribed word Leliel. "And I think would extremely wise avoid interaction Lord Malfoy henceforth."  "Did intercept owls me?" said Harry.  The Headmaster gazed Harry long moment, reluctantly nodded.  For reason Harry feeling outraged been. Maybe Harry finding easy sympathize Headmaster's point view right now. Even Harry could understand Dumbledore want interact Lucius Malfoy; seem like evil deed.  Not like Headmaster blackmailing Zabini... Zabini's word, Zabini wildly untrustworthy, fact hard see Zabini tell story got sympathy Professor Quirrell...  "How if, instead protesting, I say I understand point view," said Harry, "and go intercepting owls, tell from?"  "I intercepted great many owls you, I afraid," Dumbledore said soberly. "You celebrity, Harry, would receive dozens letters day, far outside country, I turn back."  "That," Harry said, starting feel bit indignation, "seems like going little far -"  "Many letters," old wizard said quietly, "will asking things cannot give. I read them, course, turned back senders undelivered. But I know, I receive too. And young, Harry, heart broken six times breakfast morning."  Harry looked shoes. He insist reading letters judging himself, but... small voice common sense inside him, screaming loudly right now.  "Thank you," Harry muttered.  "The reason I asked here," said old wizard, "was I wished consult unique genius."  "Transfiguration?" said Harry, surprised flattered.  "No, unique genius," said Dumbledore. "Tell me, Harry, evil could accomplish Dementor allowed onto grounds Hogwarts?"   It developed Professor Quirrell asked, rather demanded, students test skills actual Dementor learned words gestures Patronus Charm.  "Professor Quirrell unable cast Patronus Charm himself," said Dumbledore, paced slowly devices. "Which never good sign. But then, volunteered fact course demanding outside instructors brought teach Patronus Charm every student wished learn; offered pay expense himself, I would not. This impressed greatly. But insists bringing Dementor -"  "Headmaster," Harry said quietly, "Professor Quirrell believes strongly live-fire tests realistic combat conditions. Wanting bring actual Dementor completely character him."  Now Headmaster giving Harry strange look.  "In character?" said old wizard.  "I mean," said Harry, "it's entirely consistent way Professor Quirrell usually acts..." Harry trailed off. Why put way?  The Headmaster nodded. "So sense I do; excuse. A reasonable excuse, sure; may realize. Often, wizards seemingly unable cast Patronus Charm succeed presence actual Dementor, going single flicker light full corporeal Patronus. Why be, one knows; so."  Harry frowned. "Then I really see suspicious -"  The Headmaster spread hands though helplessness. "Harry, Defense Professor asked pass darkest creatures gates Hogwarts. I must suspicious." The Headmaster sighed. "And yet Dementor guarded, warded, mighty cage, I watch times - I cannot think ill could done. But perhaps I merely unable see it. And I asking you."  Harry stared Headmaster mouth open. He shocked even feel flattered.  "Me?" said Harry.  "Yes," said Dumbledore, smiling slightly. "I try best anticipate foes, encompass wicked minds predict evil thoughts. But I would never imagined sharpening Hufflepuff's bones weapons."  Was Harry ever going live down?  "Headmaster," Harry said wearily, "I know sound good, seriousness: I'm evil, I'm creative -"  "I say evil," Dumbledore said seriously. "There say comprehend evil become evil; merely pretending wise. Rather evil know love, dares imagine love, cannot ever understand love without ceasing evil. And I suspect imagine way minds Dark Wizards better I ever could, still knowing love yourself. So, Harry." The Headmaster's eyes intent. "If stood Professor Quirrell's shoes, misdeeds could accomplish tricked allowing Dementor onto grounds Hogwarts?"  "Hold on," said Harry, something daze trudged chair front Headmaster's desk, sat down. It large comfortable chair time, wooden stool, Harry could feel enveloped sank it.  Dumbledore asking outwit Professor Quirrell.  Point one: Harry rather fonder Professor Quirrell Dumbledore.  Point two: The hypothesis Defense Professor planning something evil, subjunctive case, Harry ought helping Headmaster prevent it.  Point three...  "Headmaster," Harry said, "if Professor Quirrell something, I'm sure I outwit him. He's got lot experience I do."  The old wizard shook head, somehow managing appear solemn despite smile. "You underestimate yourself."  That first time anyone ever said Harry.  "I remember," old wizard continued, "a young man office, cold controlled faced Head House Slytherin, blackmailing Headmaster protect classmates. And I believe young man cunning Professor Quirrell, cunning Lucius Malfoy, grow equal Voldemort himself. It I wish consult."  Harry suppressed chill went name, frowned thoughtfully Headmaster.  How much know...?  The Headmaster seen Harry grip mysterious dark side, deep Harry ever sunk it. Harry still remembered like watch, invisibly Time-Turned, past self faced older Slytherins; boy scar forehead act like others. Of course Headmaster would noticed something odd boy office...  And Dumbledore concluded pet hero cunning match destined foe, Dark Lord.  Which asking much, considering Dark Lord put clearly visible Dark Mark servants' left arms, he'd slaughtered entire monastery taught martial art he'd wanted learn.  Enough cunning match Professor Quirrell would whole different order problem.  But also clear Headmaster satisfied Harry went cold darkish, came sort answer sounded impressively cunning... better actually get way Professor Quirrell's teaching Defense...  And course Harry would go dark side think direction, honest, case.  "Tell me," Harry said, "everything Dementor brought in, guarded."  Dumbledore's eyebrows rose moment, old wizard began speak.  The Dementor would transported grounds Hogwarts Auror trio, three personally known Headmaster, three able cast corporeal Patronus Charm. They would met edge grounds Dumbledore, would pass Dementor Hogwarts wards -  Harry asked pass permanent temporary - whether someone could bring Dementor next day.  The pass temporary (replied Headmaster approving nod), explanation went on: The Dementor would cage solid titanium bars, Transfigured true-forged; time Dementor's presence would corrode metal dust, single day.  Students awaiting turn would stay well back Dementor, behind two corporeal Patronuses maintained two three Aurors given time. Dumbledore would wait Dementor's cage Patronus. A single student would approach Dementor; Dumbledore would dispel Patronus; student would attempt cast Patronus Charm; failed, Dumbledore would restore Patronus student could suffer permanent damage. Past dueling champion Professor Flitwick would also present students near, add safety margin.  "Why waiting Dementor?" said Harry. "I mean, plus Auror -"  The Headmaster shook head. "They could withstand repeated exposure Dementor, time I dispel Patronus."  And Dumbledore's Patronus fail reason, one students still near Dementor, third Auror would cast another corporeal Patronus send shield student...  Harry poked prodded, see flaw security.  So Harry took deep breath, sank chair, closed eyes, remembered:  "And be... five points? No, let us make even ten points Ravenclaw backchat."  The cold came slowly now, reluctantly, Harry calling much dark side lately...  Harry run entire session Potions mind, blood chilled something approaching deadly crystalline clarity.  And thought Dementor.  And obvious.  "The Dementor distraction," Harry said. The coldness clear voice, since Dumbledore wanted expected. "A large, salient threat, end straightforward, easy defend against. So attention focused Dementor, real plot happening elsewhere."  Dumbledore stared Harry moment, gave slow nod. "Yes..." said Headmaster. "And I believe I know might distraction from, Professor Quirrell means ill... thank you, Harry."  The Headmaster still staring Harry, strange look ancient eyes.  "What?" said Harry tinge annoyance, cold still lingering blood.  "I another question young man," said Headmaster. "It something I long wondered myself, yet unable comprehend. Why?" There tinge pain voice. "Why would anyone deliberately make monster? Why evil sake evil? Why Voldemort?"   Whirr, bzzzt, tick; ding, puff, splat...  Harry stared Headmaster surprise.  "How would I know?" said Harry. "Am I supposed magically understand Dark Lord I'm hero, something?"  "Yes!" said Dumbledore. "My great foe Grindelwald, I understood well indeed. Grindelwald dark mirror, man I could easily been, I given temptation believe I good person, therefore always right. For greater good, slogan; truly believed himself, even tore Europe like wounded animal. And him, I defeated end. But came Voldemort, destroy everything I protected Britain." The hurt plain Dumbledore's voice, exposed upon face. "He committed acts worse far Grindelwald's worst, horror sake horror. I sacrificed everything hold back, I still understand why!Why, Harry? Why it? He never destined foe, yours, guesses all, Harry, please tell me! Why?"  Harry stared hands. The truth Harry read Dark Lord yet, right tiniest clue. And somehow seem like answer Headmaster wanted hear. "Too many Dark rituals, maybe? In beginning thought he'd one, sacrificed part good side, made less reluctant perform Dark rituals, more rituals positive feedback cycle ended tremendously powerful monster -"  "No!" Now Headmaster's voice agonized. "I can't believe that, Harry! There something that!"  Why be? thought Harry, say it, clear Headmaster thought universe story plot, huge tragedies allowed happen except equally huge, significant reasons. "I'm sorry, Headmaster. The Dark Lord seem like much dark mirror me, all. There anything I find even tiniest bit tempting nailing skins Yermy Wibble's family newsroom wall."  "Have wisdom share?" said Dumbledore. There pleading old wizard's voice, almost begging.  Evil happens, thought Harry, mean anything teach us anything, except evil? The Dark Lord probably selfish bastard care hurt, idiot made stupidly avoidable mistakes snowballed. There destiny behind ills world; Hitler allowed architecture school like wanted, whole history Europe would different; lived sort universe horrible things allowed happen good reasons, happen first place.  And none that, obviously, Headmaster wanted hear.  The old wizard still looking Harry fiddly thing like frozen puff smoke, painful desperation ancient, waiting eyes.  Well, sounding wise difficult. It lot easier intelligent, actually, since say anything surprising come new insights. You let brain's pattern-matching software complete cliche, using whatever Deep Wisdom stored previously.  "Headmaster," Harry said solemnly, "I would rather define enemies."  Somehow, even midst whirring ticking, kind silence.  That come bit Deeply Wise Harry intended.  "You may wise, Harry..." Headmaster said slowly. "I wish... I could defined friends." The pain voice grown deeper.  Harry's mind searched hastily something else Deeply Wise say would soften unintended force blow -  "Or perhaps," Harry said softly, "it foe makes Gryffindor, friend makes Hufflepuff, ambition makes Slytherin. I know always, every generation, puzzle makes scientist."  "It dreadful fate condemn House, Harry," said Headmaster. The pain still voice. "For remark it, I think I much made enemies."  Harry stared hands, lay lap. Maybe shut ahead.  "But answered question," said Dumbledore softly, though himself. "I realized would Slytherin's key. For ambition, sake ambition; I know, though why..." For time Dumbledore stared nothingness; straightened, eyes seemed focus Harry again.  "And you, Harry," said Headmaster, "you name scientist?" His voice laced surprise mild disapproval.  "You like science?" said Harry little wearily. He'd hoped Dumbledore would fonder Muggle things.  "I suppose useful without wands," said Dumbledore, frowning. "But seems strange thing define yourself. Is science important love? As kindness? As friendship? Is science makes fond Minerva McGonagall? Is science makes care Hermione Granger? Will science turn, try kindle warmth Draco Malfoy's heart?"  You know, sad thing is, probably think uttered kind incredibly wise knockdown argument.  Now, phrase rejoinder fashion also sounded incredibly wise...  "You Ravenclaw," Harry said calm dignity, "and might occurred to respect truth, seek days life, could also act grace."  The Headmaster's eyebrows rose up. And sighed. "How become wise, young...?" The old wizard sounded sad, said it. "Perhaps prove valuable you."  Only impressing ancient wizards overly impressed themselves, thought Harry. He actually bit disappointed Dumbledore's credulity; Harry lied, Dumbledore seemed far impressed Harry's ability phrase things sounded profound, instead putting plain English like Richard Feynman done wisdom...  "Love important wisdom," said Harry, test limits Dumbledore's tolerance blindingly obvious cliches completed sheer pattern matching without sort detailed analysis.  The Headmaster nodded gravely, said, "Indeed."  Harry stood chair, stretched arms. Well, I'd better go love something, then, that's bound help defeat Dark Lord. And next time ask advice, I'll give hug -  "This day helped much, Harry," said Headmaster. "And one last thing I would ask young man."  Great.  "Tell me, Harry," said Headmaster (and voice sounded simply puzzled, though still hint pain eyes), "why Dark Wizards fear death greatly?"  "Er," said Harry, "sorry, I've got back Dark Wizards one."   Whoosh, hiss, chime; glorp, pop, bubble -  "What?" said Dumbledore.  "Death bad," said Harry, discarding wisdom sake clear communication. "Very bad. Extremely bad. Being scared death like scared great big monster poisonous fangs. It actually makes great deal sense, not, fact, indicate psychological problem."  The Headmaster staring though he'd turned cat.  "Okay," said Harry, "let put way. Do want die? Because so, there's Muggle thing called suicide prevention hotline -"  "When time," old wizard said quietly. "Not before. I would never seek hasten day, seek refuse comes."  Harry frowning sternly. "That sound like strong live, Headmaster!"  "Harry..." The old wizard's voice starting sound little helpless; paced spot silver beard, unnoticed, drifted crystalline glass goldfish bowl, slowly taking greenish tinge crept hairs. "I think I may made clear. Dark Wizards eager live. They fear death. They reach toward sun's light, flee coming night infinitely darker caverns making, without moon stars. It life desire, immortality; driven grasp sacrifice souls! Do want live forever, Harry?"  "Yes, you," said Harry. "I want live one day. Tomorrow I still want live one day. Therefore I want live forever, proof induction positive integers. If want die, means want live forever. If want live forever, means want die. You've got one other... I'm getting here, I."  The two cultures stared across vast gap incommensurability.  "I lived hundred ten years," old wizard said quietly (taking beard bowl, jiggling shake color). "I seen done great many things, many I wish I never seen done. And yet I regret alive, watching students grow joy begun wear me. But I would wish live long does! What would eternity, Harry?"  Harry took deep breath. "Meet interesting people world, read good books write something even better, celebrate first grandchild's tenth birthday party Moon, celebrate first great-great-great grandchild's hundredth birthday party around Rings Saturn, learn deepest final rules Nature, understand nature consciousness, find anything exists first place, visit stars, discover aliens, create aliens, rendezvous everyone party side Milky Way we've explored whole thing, meet everyone else born Old Earth watch Sun finally go out, I used worry finding way escape universe ran negentropy I'm lot hopeful I've discovered so-called laws physics optional guidelines."  "I understand much that," said Dumbledore. "But I must ask things truly desire desperately, imagine imagine tired, run run death."  "Life finite list things check allowed die," Harry said firmly. "It's life, go living it. If I'm things it'll I've found something better."  Dumbledore sighed. His fingers drummed clock; touched it, numerals changed indecipherable script, hands briefly appeared different positions. "In unlikely event I permitted tarry hundred fifty," said old wizard, "I think I would mind. But two hundred years would entirely much good thing."  "Yes, well," Harry said, voice little dry thought Mum Dad allotted span Harry something it, "I suspect, Headmaster, came culture people accustomed living four hundred years, dying two hundred would seem tragically premature dying at, say, eighty." Harry's voice went hard, last word.  "Perhaps," old wizard said peacefully. "I would wish die friends, live gone. The hardest time loved gone you, yet others still live, whose sake must stay..." Dumbledore's eyes fixed Harry, growing sad. "Do mourn greatly, Harry, time comes; I I long missed, next great adventure."  "Oh!" Harry said sudden realization. "You believe afterlife. I got impression wizards religion?"   Toot. Beep. Thud.  "How believe it?" said Headmaster, looking completely flabbergasted. "Harry, wizard! You've seen ghosts!"  "Ghosts," Harry said, voice flat. "You mean things like portraits, stored memories behaviors awareness life, accidentally impressed surrounding material burst magic accompanies violent death wizard -"  "I've heard theory," said Headmaster, voice growing sharp, "repeated wizards mistake cynicism wisdom, think look upon others elevate themselves. It one silliest ideas I heard hundred ten years! Yes, ghosts learn grow, belong! Souls meant move on, life remaining here! And ghosts, Veil? What Resurrection Stone?"  "All right," Harry said, trying keep voice calm, "I'll hear evidence, that's scientist does. But first, Headmaster, let tell little story." Harry's voice trembling. "You know, I got here, I got train King's Cross, I mean yesterday back September, I got train then, Headmaster, I'd never seen ghost. I expecting ghosts. So I saw them, Headmaster, I something really dumb. I jumped conclusions. I, I thought afterlife, I thought one ever really died, I thought everyone human species ever lost really fine all, I thought wizards could talk people who'd passed on, took right spell summon them, wizards could that, I thought I could meet parents died me, tell I'd heard sacrifice I'd begun call mother father -"  "Harry," whispered Dumbledore. Water glittered old wizard's eyes. He took step closer across office -  "And then," spat Harry, fury coming fully voice, cold rage universe like stupid, "I asked Hermione said afterimages, burned stone castle death wizard, like silhouettes left walls Hiroshima. And I known! I known without even ask! I believed even thirty seconds! Because people souls thing brain damage, soul could go speaking whole brain gone, could damage left cerebral hemisphere take away ability talk? And Professor McGonagall, told parents died, act like they'd gone away long trip another country, like they'd emigrated Australia back days sailing ships, way people would act actually knew death going somewhere else, hard evidence afterlife, instead making stuff console themselves, would change everything, matter everyone lost someone war, would little sad horrible! And I'd already seen people wizarding world act like that! So I known better! And I knew parents really dead gone forever ever, anything left them, I'd never get chance meet and, and, children thought I crying I scared ghosts -"  The old wizard's face horrified, opened mouth speak -  "So tell me, Headmaster! Tell evidence! But dare exaggerate single tiny bit it, give false hope again, I find later lied stretched things little, I ever forgive it! What's Veil?"  Harry reached wiped cheeks, glass things office stopped vibrating last shriek.  "The Veil," said old wizard slight tremble voice, "is great stone archway, kept Department Mysteries; gateway land dead."  "And anyone know that?" said Harry. "Don't tell believe, tell seen!"  The physical manifestation barrier worlds great stone archway, old tall coming sharp point, tattered black veil like surface pool water, stretched stones; rippling, always, constant one-way passage souls. If stood Veil could hear voices dead calling, always calling whispers barely wrong side comprehension, growing louder numerous stayed tried hear, tried communicate; listened long, would go meet them, moment touched Veil would sucked through, never heard again.  "That even sound like interesting fraud," Harry said, voice calmer nothing make hope, make angry hopes dashed. "Someone built stone archway, made little black rippling surface Vanished anything touched, enchanted whisper people hypnotize them."  "Harry..." Headmaster said, starting look rather worried. "I tell truth, refuse hear it..."  Also interesting.  "What's Resurrection Stone?"  "I would tell you," Headmaster said slowly, "save I fear disbelief may you... listen, then, Harry, please listen..."  The Resurrection Stone one three legendary Deathly Hallows, kin Harry's cloak. The Resurrection Stone could call souls back dead - bring back world living, though were. Cadmus Peverell used stone call back lost beloved dead, heart stayed dead, world living. And time drove mad, killed truly more...  In politeness, Harry raised hand.  "Yes?" Headmaster said reluctantly.  "The obvious test see Resurrection Stone really calling back dead, projecting image user's mind, ask question whose answer know, dead person would, definitely verified world. For example, call back -"  Then Harry paused, time he'd managed think one step ahead tongue, fast enough say first name test sprung mind.  "...your dead wife, ask left lost earring, something like that," Harry finished. "Did anyone tests like that?"  "The Resurrection Stone lost centuries, Harry," Headmaster said quietly.  Harry shrugged. "Well, I'm scientist, I'm always willing convinced. If really believe Resurrection Stone calls back dead - must believe test like succeed, right? So know anything find Resurrection Stone? I got one Deathly Hallow already highly mysterious circumstances, and, well, know rhythm world works sort thing."  Dumbledore stared Harry.  Harry gazed equably back Headmaster.  The old wizard passed hand across forehead muttered, "This madness."  (Somehow, Harry managed stop laughing.)  And Dumbledore told Harry draw forth Cloak Invisibility pouch; Headmaster's direction, Harry stared inside back hood saw it, faintly drawn silvery mesh faded scarlet like dried blood, symbol Deathly Hallows: triangle, circle drawn inside, line dividing both.  "Thank you," Harry said politely. "I shall sure keep eye stone marked. Do evidence?"  Dumbledore appeared fighting struggle within himself. "Harry," old wizard said, voice rising, "this dangerous road walking, I sure I right thing saying this, I must wrench way! Harry, could Voldemort survived death body soul?"  And Harry realized exactly one person who'd originally told Professor McGonagall Dark Lord still alive first place; crazy Headmaster madhouse school, thought world ran cliches.  "Good question," Harry said, internal debate proceed. "Maybe found way duplicating power Resurrection Stone, loaded advance complete copy brain state. Or something like that." Harry suddenly far sure trying come explanation something actually happened. "Actually, go ahead tell everything know Dark Lord survived might take kill him?"  If even still exists Quibbler headlines.  "You fooling me, Harry," said old wizard; face looked ancient now, lined years. "I know truly asking question. No, I read mind, I to, hesitation gives away! You seek secret Dark Lord's immortality order use yourself!"  "Wrong! I want secret Dark Lord's immortality order use everyone!"   Tick, crackle, fzzzt...  Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore stood stared Harry mouth gaping open dumbly.  (Harry awarded tally mark Monday, since he'd managed blow someone's mind completely day over.)  "And case clear," said Harry, "by everyone I mean Muggles too, wizards."  "No," said old wizard, shaking head. His voice rose. "No, no, no! This insanity!"  "Bwa ha ha!" said Harry.  The old wizard's face tight anger worry. "Voldemort stole book gleaned secret; I went look it. But much I know, much I tell you: immortality born ritual terrible Dark, blacker pitchest black! And Myrtle, poor sweet Myrtle, died it; immortality took sacrifice, took murder -"  "Well obviously I'm going popularize method immortality requires killing people! That would defeat entire point!"  There startled pause.  Slowly old wizard's face relaxed anger, though worry still there. "You would use ritual requiring human sacrifice."  "I know take for, Headmaster," Harry said coldly, anger rising, "but let's forget I'm one wants people live! The one wants save everyone! You're one thinks death awesome everyone ought die!"  "I loss, Harry," said old wizard. His feet began trudging across strange office. "I know say." He picked crystal ball seemed hold hand flames, looked sad expression. "Only I greatly misunderstood you... I want everyone die, Harry!"  "You want anyone immortal," Harry said considerable irony. It seemed elementary logical tautologies like All x: Die(x) = Not Exist x: Not Die(x) beyond reasoning abilities world's powerful wizard.  The old wizard nodded. "I less afraid I was, still greatly worried you, Harry," said quietly. His hand, little wizened time, still strong, placed crystal ball firmly back stand. "For fear death bitter thing, illness soul people twisted warped. Voldemort Dark Wizard go bleak road, though I fear taken him."  "And think afraid death?" Harry said, even trying mask incredulity voice.  The old wizard's face peaceful. "I perfect, Harry, I think I accepted death part myself."  "Uh huh," Harry said. "See, there's little thing called cognitive dissonance, plainer English, sour grapes. If people hit heads truncheons month, one could anything it, pretty soon there'd sorts philosophers, pretending wise put it, found sorts amazing benefits hit head truncheon month. Like, makes tougher, makes happier days getting hit truncheon. But went someone getting hit, asked wanted start, exchange amazing benefits, they'd say no. And die, came somewhere one ever even heard death, I suggested would amazing wonderful great idea people get wrinkled old eventually cease exist, why, hauled right lunatic asylum! So would anyone possibly think thought silly death good thing? Because afraid it, really want die, thought hurts much inside rationalize away, something numb pain, think -"  "No, Harry," old wizard said. His face gentle, hand trailed lighted pool water made small musical chimes fingers stirred it. "Though I understand must think so."  "Do want understand Dark Wizard?" Harry said, voice hard grim. "Then look within part flees death fear death, finds fear unbearable embrace Death friend cozen it, try become one night think master abyss. You taken terrible evils called good! With slight twist part would murder innocents, call friendship. If call death better life twist moral compass point anywhere -"  "I think," said Dumbledore, shaking water droplets hand sound tiny tinkling bells, "that understand Dark Wizards well, without yet one yourself." It said perfect seriousness, without accusation. "But comprehension me, I fear, sorely lacking." The old wizard smiling now, gentle laughter voice.  Harry trying go colder already was; somewhere pouring mind blazing fury resentment, Dumbledore's condescension, laughter wise old fools ever used place argument. "Funny thing, know, I thought Draco Malfoy going impossible talk to, instead, childish innocence, hundred times stronger you."  A look puzzlement crossed old wizard's face. "What mean?"  "I mean," Harry said, voice biting, "that Draco actually took beliefs seriously processed words instead throwing window smiling gentle superiority. You're old wise, can't even notice anything I'm saying! Not understand, notice!"  "I listened you, Harry," said Dumbledore, looking solemn now, "but listen always agree. Disagreements aside, think I comprehend?"  That really believed afterlife, go St. Mungo's kill Neville's parents, Alice Frank Longbottom, could go next great adventure, instead letting linger damaged state -  Harry barely, barely kept saying loud.  "All right," Harry said coldly. "I'll answer original question, then. You asked Dark Wizards afraid death. Pretend, Headmaster, really believed souls. Pretend anyone could verify existence souls time, pretend nobody cried funerals knew loved ones still alive. Now imagine destroying soul? Ripping shreds nothing remains go next great adventure? Can imagine terrible thing would be, worst crime ever committed history universe, would anything prevent happening even once? Because that's Death really - annihilation soul!"  The old wizard staring him, sad look eyes. "I suppose I understand now," said quietly.  "Oh?" said Harry. "Understand what?"  "Voldemort," said old wizard. "I understand last. Because believe world truly like that, must believe justice it, woven darkness core. I asked became monster, could give reason. And I could ask him, I suppose, answer would be: Why not?"   They stood gazing other's eyes, old wizard robes, young boy lightning-bolt scar forehead.  "Tell me, Harry," said old wizard, "will become monster?"  "No," said boy, iron certainty voice.  "Why not?" said old wizard.  The young boy stood straight, chin raised high proud, said: "There justice laws Nature, Headmaster, term fairness equations motion. The universe neither evil, good, simply care. The stars care, Sun, sky. But to! We care! There light world, us!"  "I wonder become you, Harry," said old wizard. His voice soft, strange wonder regret it. "It enough make wish live see it."  The boy bowed heavy irony, departed; oaken door slammed shut behind thud.   Chapter 40: Pretending Wise, Pt 2  Harry, holding tea cup exactly correct way Professor Quirrell needed demonstrate three times, took small, careful sip. All way across long, wide table centerpiece Mary's Room, Professor Quirrell took sip cup, making look far natural elegant. The tea something whose name Harry even pronounce, least, every time Harry tried repeat Chinese words, Professor Quirrell corrected him, finally Harry given up.  Harry maneuvered getting glimpse bill last time, Professor Quirrell let get away it.  He'd felt impulse drink Comed-Tea first.  Even taking account, Harry still shocked skin.  And still tasted like, well, tea.  There quiet, nagging suspicion Harry's mind Professor Quirrell knew this, deliberately buying ridiculously expensive tea Harry appreciate mess him. Professor Quirrell might like much. Maybe nobody actually liked tea, point ridiculously expensive make victim feel unappreciative. In fact, maybe really ordinary tea, asked certain code, put fake gigantic price bill...  Professor Quirrell's expression drawn thoughtful. "No," Professor Quirrell said, "you told Headmaster conversation Lord Malfoy. Please try think faster next time, Mr. Potter."  "I'm sorry, Professor Quirrell," Harry said meekly. "I still see it." There times Harry felt much like impostor, pretending cunning Professor Quirrell's presence.  "Lord Malfoy Albus Dumbledore's opponent," said Professor Quirrell. "At least present time. All Britain chessboard, wizards pieces. Consider: Lord Malfoy threatened throw away everything, abandon game, take vengeance Mr. Malfoy hurt. In case, Mr. Potter...?"  It took long seconds Harry get it, clear Professor Quirrell going give hints, Harry wanted them.  Then Harry's mind finally made connection, frowned. "Dumbledore kills Draco, makes look like I it, Lucius sacrifices game Dumbledore get me? That... seem like Headmaster's style, Professor Quirrell..." Harry's mind flashed back similar warning Draco, made Harry say thing.  Professor Quirrell shrugged, sipped tea.  Harry sipped tea, sat silence. The tablecloth spread table peaceful pattern, seeming first like plain cloth, stared long enough, kept silent long enough, started see faint tracery flowers glimmering it; curtains room changed pattern match, seemed shimmer though silent breeze. Professor Quirrell contemplative mood Saturday, Harry, Mary's Room, seemed, neglected notice this.  "Professor Quirrell," Harry said suddenly, "is afterlife?"  Harry chosen question carefully. Not, believe afterlife? simply Is afterlife? What people really believed seem like beliefs all. People say, 'I strongly believe sky blue!' They said, 'the sky blue'. Your true inner map world felt like way world was...  The Defense Professor raised cup lips answering. His face thoughtful. "If is, Mr. Potter," said Professor Quirrell, "then quite wizards wasted great deal effort searches immortality."  "That's actually answer," Harry observed. He'd learned notice sort thing talking Professor Quirrell.  Professor Quirrell set teacup small, high-pitched tacking sound saucer. "Some wizards reasonably intelligent, Mr. Potter, may take existence afterlife obvious. I looked matter myself. There many claims sort hope fear would expected produce. Among reports whose veracity doubt, nothing could result mere wizardry. There certain devices said communicate dead, these, I suspect, project image mind; result seems indistinguishable memory memory. The alleged spirits tell secrets knew life, could learned death, known wielder -"  "Which Resurrection Stone valuable magical artifact world," said Harry.  "Precisely," said Professor Quirrell, "though I say chance try it." There dry, thin smile lips; something colder, distant, eyes. "You spoke Dumbledore well, I take it."  Harry nodded.  The curtains taking faintly blue pattern, dim tracery elaborate snowflakes seemed becoming visible tablecloth. Professor Quirrell's voice sounded calm. "The Headmaster persuasive, Mr. Potter. I hope persuaded you."  "Heck no," said Harry. "Didn't fool second."  "I hope not," said Professor Quirrell, still calm tone. "I would extremely put discover Headmaster convinced throw away life fool plot telling death next great adventure."  "I think Headmaster believed himself, actually," Harry said. He sipped tea again. "He asked I could possibly eternity, gave usual line boring, seem see conflict claim immortal soul. In fact, gave whole long lecture awful want immortality claimed immortal soul. I can't quite visualize must going inside head, I think actually mental model continuing forever afterlife..."  The temperature room seemed dropping.  "You perceive," said voice like ice end table, "that Dumbledore truly believe speaks. It compromised principles. It never beginning. Are becoming cynical yet, Mr. Potter?"  Harry dropped eyes teacup. "A little," Harry said possibly-ultra-high-quality, perhaps-ridiculously-expensive Chinese tea. "I'm certainly becoming bit frustrated with... whatever's going wrong people's heads."  "Yes," said icy voice. "I find frustrating well."  "Is way get people that?" said Harry teacup.  "There indeed certain useful spell solves problem."  Harry looked hopefully that, saw cold, cold smile Defense Professor's face.  Then Harry got it. "I mean, besides Avada Kedavra."  The Defense Professor laughed. Harry didn't.  "Anyway," Harry said hastily, "I think fast enough suggest obvious idea Resurrection Stone front Dumbledore. Have ever seen stone line, inside circle, inside triangle?"  The deathly chill seemed draw back, fold itself, ordinary Professor Quirrell returned. "Not I recall," Professor Quirrell said while, thoughtful frown face. "That Resurrection Stone?"  Harry set aside teacup, drew saucer symbol seen inside cloak. And Harry could take wand cast Hover Charm, saucer went floating obligingly across table toward Professor Quirrell. Harry really wanted learn wandless stuff, that, apparently, far current curriculum.  Professor Quirrell studied Harry's tea-saucer moment, shook head; moment later, saucer went floating back Harry.  Harry put teacup back saucer, noting absently symbol he'd drawn vanished. "If happen see stone symbol," said Harry, "and talk afterlife, let know. I questions Merlin anyone around Atlantis."  "Quite," said Professor Quirrell. Then Defense Professor lifted teacup again, tipped back though finish last there. "By way, Mr. Potter, I fear shall cut short today's visit Diagon Alley. I hoping would - never mind. Let stand something else I must afternoon."  Harry nodded, finished tea, rose seat time Professor Quirrell.  "One last question," Harry said, Professor Quirrell's coat lifted coatrack went floating toward Defense Professor. "Magic loose world, I longer trust guesses much I did. So best guess without wishful thinking, believe there's afterlife?"  "If I did, Mr. Potter," said Professor Quirrell shrugged coat, "would I still here?"   Chapter 41: Frontal Override  The biting January wind howled around vast, blank stone walls demarcated material bounds castle Hogwarts, whispering whistling odd pitches blew past closed windows stone turrets. The recent snow mostly blown away, occasional patches melted refrozen ice still stuck stone face blazed reflected sunlight. From distance, must looked like Hogwarts blinking hundreds eyes.  A sudden gust made Draco flinch, try, impossibly, press body even closer stone, felt like ice smelled like ice. Some utterly pointless instinct seemed convinced blown outer wall Hogwarts, best way prevent jerk around helpless reflex possibly throw up.  Draco trying hard think six stories worth empty air underneath him, focus, instead, going kill Harry Potter.  "You know, Mr. Malfoy," said young girl beside conversational voice, "if seer told someday I'd hanging onto side castle fingertips, trying look think loud Mum'd scream saw me, I wouldn't've idea it'd happen, except it'd Harry Potter's fault."   Earlier:  The two allied Generals stepped together Longbottom's body, boots hitting floor almost perfect synchrony.  Only single soldier stood Harry, Slytherin boy named Samuel Clamons, whose hand clenched white around wand, held upward sustain Prismatic Wall. The boy's breathing coming rapidly, face showed cold determination lit eyes general, Harry Potter, standing behind Prismatic Wall dead end corridor next open window, hands held mysteriously behind back.  The battle ridiculously difficult, enemy outnumbered two-to-one. It easy, Dragon Army Sunshine Regiment melded together easily practice sessions, they'd fought long enough know well indeed. Morale high, armies knowing time fighting win themselves, fighting world free traitors. Despite surprised protests generals, soldiers combined army insisted calling Dramione's Sungon Argiment, produced patches insignia smiling face wreathed flames.  But Harry's soldiers blackened insignia - look like paint, like they'd burned part uniforms - they'd fought upper levels Hogwarts desperate fury. The cold rage Draco sometimes saw Harry seemed trickle soldiers, they'd fought like play. And Harry emptied entire bag tricks, there'd tiny metal balls (Granger identified "ball bearings") floors staircases, rendering impassable cleared, Harry's army already practiced coordinated Hover Charms could fly people right obstacles they'd made...  You bring devices game outside, could Transfigure anything wanted game, long safe. And fair fighting boy raised scientists, knew things like ball bearings skateboards bungee cords.  And come this.  The survivors allied forces cornered last remnants Harry Potter's army dead-end corridor.  Weasley Vincent rushed Longbottom time, moving together like they'd practiced weeks instead hours, somehow Longbottom managed hex falling himself.  And Draco Granger Padma Samuel Harry, looks Samuel, Prismatic Wall last much longer.  Draco already leveled wand Harry, waiting Prismatic Wall fall accord; need waste Breaking Drill Hex then. Padma leveled wand Samuel, Granger leveled Harry...  Harry still hiding hands behind back, instead aiming wand; looking face could carved ice.  It might bluff. It probably wasn't.  There brief, tense silence.  And Harry spoke.  "I'm villain now," young boy said coldly, "and think villains easy finish off, better think again. Beat I'm fighting seriously, I'll stay beaten; lose, we'll next time."  The boy brought hands forward, Draco saw Harry wearing strange gloves, peculiar grayish material fingertips, buckles stapped gloves tightly wrists.  Beside Draco, Sunshine General gasped horror; Draco, without even asking why, fired Breaking Drill Hex.  Samuel staggered, let scream staggered, held Wall; Padma Granger fired now, would exhaust forces badly might lose.  "Harry!" shouted Granger. "You can't serious!"  Harry already motion.  And swung open window, cold voice said, "Follow dare."   The icy wind howled around them.  Draco's arms already starting feel tired.  ...It developed that, yesterday, Harry carefully demonstrated Granger exactly Transfigure gloves currently wearing, used something called 'gecko setae'; glue Transfigured patches material toes shoes; Harry Granger had, innocent childish play, tried climbing around walls ceiling little.  And that, also yesterday, Harry supplied Granger grand total exactly two doses Feather-Falling Potion carry around pouch, "just case".  Not Padma would followed them, anyway. She crazy.  Draco carefully peeled loose right hand, stretched far could, slapped stone again. Beside him, Granger same.  They'd already swallowed Feather-Falling Potion. It skirting edges game rules, potion activated unless one actually fell, long fall using item.  Professor Quirrell watching them.  The two perfectly, completely, utterly safe.  Harry Potter, hand, going die.  "I wonder Harry this," said General Granger reflective tone, slowly peeled fingertips one hand wall extended sticky sound. Her hand plopped back almost soon lifted. "I'll ask I kill him."  It amazing much two turning common.  Draco really feel like talking right now, managed say, gritted teeth, "Could revenge. For date."  "Really," said Granger. "After time."  Stick. Plop.  "How sweet him," said Granger.  Stick. Plop.  "I guess I'll find truly romantic way thank him," said Granger.  Stick. Plop.  "What's got you?" said Granger.  Stick. Plop.  The icy wind howled around them.   One might thought would feel safer ground feet again.  But ground slanted roof tiled rough slats, rather lot ice stone walls, running across high rate speed...  Then would sadly mistaken.  "Luminos!" shouted Draco.  "Luminos!" shouted Granger.  "Luminos!" shouted Draco.  "Luminos!" shouted Granger.  The distant figure dodging scrambling ran, single shot hit, gaining.  Until Granger slipped.  It inevitable, retrospect, real life actually run across icy slanted rooftops high rate speed.  And also inevitably, happened without slightest thought, Draco spun grabbed Granger's right arm, caught her, already far balance, falling pulling Draco her, happened quickly -  There hard, painful impact, Draco's weight hitting rooftop Granger's weight too, she'd hit little bit closer edge could made it, instead body tipped legs slipped hand grabbed frantically...  And Draco ended holding onto Granger's arm white grip, hand clenched frantically edge rooftop toes Draco's shoes dug edge roof tile.  "Hermione!" Harry's voice shrieked distantly.  "Draco," whispered Granger's voice, Draco looked down.  That might mistake. There lot air underneath her, nothing air, edge rooftop jutted main stone wall Hogwarts.  "He's going come help me," whispered girl, "but first he's going Luminos us, there's way wouldn't. You let go."  It easiest thing world.  She mudblood, mudblood, mudblood!  She even hurt!  ...Draco's brain listening anything Draco telling right now.  "Do it," Hermione Granger whispered, eyes blazing without single trace fear, "do it, Draco, it, beat win Draco!"  There sound someone running coming closer.  Oh, rational...  The voice Draco's head sounded awful lot like Harry Potter teaching lessons.  ...are going let brain run life?   Aftermath, 1:  It taking bit effort Daphne Greengrass keep quiet, Millicent Bulstrode retold story Slytherin girls' common room (a cozy cool place dungeons running beneath Hogwarts Lake, fish swimming past every window, couches could lie wanted). Mostly because, Daphne's opinion, perfectly good story already without Millicent's improvements.  "And what?" gasped Flora Hestia Carrow.  "General Granger looked him," Millicent said dramatically, "and said, 'Draco! You've got let go me! Don't worry me, Draco, I promise I'll right! And suppose Malfoy then?"  "He said 'Never!'," shouted Charlotte Wiland, "and held even tighter!"  All listening girls except Pansy Parkinson nodded.  "Nope!" said Millicent. "He dropped her. And jumped shot General Potter. The end."  There stunned pause.  "You can't that!" said Charlotte.  "She's mudblood," said Pansy, sounding confused. "Of course let go!"  "Well, Malfoy grabbed first place, then!" said Charlotte. "But grabbed her, hang on! Especially face approaching certain doom!" Tracey Davis, sitting next Daphne, nodding along firm agreement.  "I see why," said Pansy.  "That's tiniest smidgin romance you," said Tracey. "Besides, can't go dropping girls. A boy who'd drop girl like that... he'd drop anyone. He'd drop you, Pansy."  "What d'you mean, drop me?" Pansy said.  Daphne resist more. "You know," Daphne said darkly, "you're eating breakfast one day table, next thing know, Malfoy lets go you, falling top Hogwarts! That's what!"  "Yeah!" said Charlotte. "He's witch dropper!"  "You know Atlantis fell?" said Tracey. "'Cause someone like Malfoy dropped it, that's why!"  Daphne lowered voice. "In fact... Malfoy's one made Hermione, I mean General Granger, slip first place? What he's make Muggleborns trip fall?"  "You mean - ?" gasped Tracey.  "That's right!" Daphne said dramatically. "What Malfoy - heir Slipperin?"  "The next Drop Lord!" said Tracey.  Which far good line anyone keep themselves, nightfall Hogwarts, next morning Quibbler's headline.   Aftermath, 2:  Hermione made sure got usual classroom nice early evening, would herself, chair, peacefully reading book, Harry got there.  If way door creak open apologetically, door creaking open.  "Um," said Harry Potter's voice.  Hermione kept reading.  "I'm, um, kinda sorry, I mean actually fall roof anything..."  It quite entertaining experience, fact.  "I, ah... I much experience apologizing, I'll fall knees want, buy something expensive, Hermione I know apologize I tell me?"  She kept reading book silence.  It idea Harry could apologize, either.  Right feeling sort odd curiosity would happen kept reading book while.   Chapter 42: Courage  "Romantic?" Hermione said. "They're boys!"  "Wow," Daphne said, sounding little shocked. "You mean Muggles really hate that? I thought something Death Eaters made up."  "No," said older Slytherin girl Hermione recognize, "it's true, get married secret, they're ever discovered, get burned stake together. And girl thinks romantic, burn too."  "That can't right!" objected Gryffindor girl, Hermione still trying sort say that. "There Muggle girls left!"  She'd kept reading quietly, Harry Potter kept trying apologize, soon dawned Hermione Harry realized, possibly first time life, he'd done something annoying; Harry, definitely first time life, terrified he'd lost friend; she'd started feel (a) guilty (b) worried direction Harry's increasingly desperate offers going. But still idea sort apology appropriate, she'd said Ravenclaw girls vote - time fix outcome, though mentioned part - Harry instantly agreed.  The next day, practically every Ravenclaw girl age thirteen voted Draco drop Harry.  Hermione felt mildly disappointed simple, though obviously fair.  Right now, however, standing outside great doors castle amid half female population Hogwarts, Hermione beginning suspect things going understand desperately hoped neither fellow generals ever heard about.   You really see details there, general fact sea expectant female faces.  "You've got idea about, you?" said Draco, sounding amused.  Harry read fair number books supposed read, mention Quibbler headlines.  "Boy-Who-Lived gets Draco Malfoy pregnant?" said Harry.  "Okay, know about," said Draco. "I thought Muggles hated that?"  "Only dumb ones," said Harry. "But, um, we, uh, little young?"  "Not young them," said Draco. He snorted. "Girls!"  They silently walked toward edge roof.  "So I'm revenge you," said Draco, "but this?"  Harry's mind made lightning calculation, weighing factors, whether soon...  "Honestly?" said Harry. "Because I meant climb icy walls, I mean fall roof. And, um, I kinda feel really awful that. I mean, I guess I actually start seeing friendly rival while. So real apology her, plot anything."  There pause.  Then -  "Yeah," said Draco. "I understand."  Harry smile. It might difficult nonsmile life.  Draco looked edge roof, made face. "This going lot harder purpose accident, it."   Harry's hand held roof reflexively terrified grip, fingers white cold, cold stone.  You could know conscious mind drunk Feather-Falling Potion. Knowing unconscious mind another matter entirely.  It every bit scary Harry thought might Hermione, justice.  "Draco," said Harry, controlling voice easy, Ravenclaw girls given script, "You've got let go!"  "Okay!" said Draco, let go Harry's arm.  Harry's hand scrabbled edge, then, without decision made, fingers failed, Harry fell.  There brief moment Harry's stomach tried leap throat, body tried desperately orient absence possible way so.  There brief moment Harry could feel Feather-Falling Potion kicking in, starting slow him, sort lurching, cushioning feeling.  And something pulled Harry accelerated downward faster gravity -  Harry's mouth already opened begun screaming part brain tried think something creative could do, part brain tried calculate much time left creative, tiny rump part brain noticed even going finish remaining-time calculation hit ground -   Harry desperately trying control hyperventilating, helping hear shrieking girls, lying heaps ground other.  "Good heavens," said unfamiliar man, old-looking clothes faintly scarred face, holding Harry arms. "Of ways I imagined might meet someday, I expect falling sky."  Harry remembered last thing he'd seen, falling body, managed gasp, "Professor... Quirrell..."  "He'll right hours," said unfamiliar man holding Harry. "He's exhausted. I thought possible... must knocked two hundred students make sure got whoever jinxing you..."  Gently, man set Harry upright ground, supporting while.  Harry carefully balanced himself, nodded man.  He let go, Harry promptly fell over.  The man helped rise again. Making sure, times, stand Harry girls picking ground, head constantly glancing direction.  "Harry," man said quietly, seriously, "do idea girls might wanted kill you?"  "Not murder," said strained voice. "Just stupidity."  This time unfamiliar man seemed almost fall over, utter shock face.  Professor Quirrell already sitting he'd fallen grass.  "Good heavens!" gasped man. "You -"  "Mr. Lupin, concerns misplaced. No wizard, matter powerful, casts Charm strength alone. You must efficient."  Professor Quirrell stand up, though.  "Thank you," Harry whispered. And then, "Thank you," man standing beside well.  "What happened?" said man.  "I foreseen myself," Professor Quirrell said, voice crisp disapproval. "Some number girls tried summon Mr. Potter own, particular arms. Individually, I suppose, thought gentle."  Oh.  "Consider lesson preparedness, Mr. Potter," said Professor Quirrell. "Had I insisted one adult witness little event, us wands out, Mr. Lupin would available slow fall afterward, would gravely injured."  "Sir!" said man - Mr. Lupin, apparently. "You say things boy!"  "Who -" Harry started say.  "The person available watch, besides myself," said Professor Quirrell. "I introduce Remus Lupin, temporarily instruct students Patronus Charm. Though I told two already met."  Harry studied man, puzzled. He remembered faintly scarred face, strange, gentle smile.  "Where meet?" said Harry.  "In Godric's Hollow," said man. "I changed number nappies."   Mr. Lupin's temporary office small stone room small wooden desk, Harry see anything Mr. Lupin sitting on, suggesting small stool like one front desk. Harry guessed Mr. Lupin Hogwarts long, use office much, he'd told house elves waste effort. It said something person tried bother house elves. Specifically, said he'd Sorted Hufflepuff, since, best Harry's knowledge, Hermione non-Hufflepuff worried bothering house elves. (Harry thought qualms rather silly. Whoever created house elves first place unspeakably evil, obviously; mean Hermione right thing denying sentient beings drudgery shaped enjoy.)  "Please sit down, Harry," man said quietly. His formal robes low quality, quite tattered, visibly worn passage time way simple Repair Charms fix; shabby word came mind. And despite that, somehow, dignity obtained fine expensive robes, fit fine robes, exclusive property shabby. Harry heard humility, he'd never seen real thing - satisfied modesty people thought part style wanted notice.  Harry took seat small wooden stool front Mr. Lupin's short desk.  "Thank coming," man said.  "No, thank saving me," said Harry. "Let know ever need something impossible done."  The man seemed hesitate. "Harry, may I... ask personal question?"  "You ask, certainly," Harry said. "I lot questions you, too."  Mr. Lupin nodded. "Harry, stepparents treating well?"  "My parents," Harry said. "I four. Michael, James, Petunia, Lily."  "Ah," said Mr. Lupin. And then, "Ah" again. He seemed blinking rather hard. "I... good hear, Harry, Dumbledore would tell none us were... I afraid might think ought wicked stepparents, such... "  Harry sure Mr. Lupin's concern misplaced, considering first encounter Dumbledore; turned well enough, said nothing. "What my..." Harry searched word raise higher put lower... "other parents? I want know, well, everything."  "A tall order," Mr. Lupin said. He wiped hand across forehead. "Well, let us begin beginning. When born, James happy touch wand without glowing gold, whole week. And even that, whenever held you, saw Lily holding you, thought you, would happen -"   Every Harry would look watch, find another thirty minutes passed. He felt slightly bad making Remus miss dinner, especially since Harry would drop back 7pm later, enough stop either them.  Finally Harry screwed enough courage ask critical question, Remus middle extended discourse wonders James's Quidditch Harry find heart squash directly.  "And when," Remus said, eyes shining brightly, "James pulled triple reverse Mulhanney Dive extra backspin! The whole crowd went wild, even Hufflepuffs cheering -"  I guess there, Harry thought - would helped way - said, "Mr. Lupin?"  Something Harry's voice must reached man, stopped mid-sentence.  "Was father bully?" said Harry.  Remus looked Harry long moment. "For little while," Remus said. "He grew soon enough. Where hear that?"  Harry answer, trying think something true say would deflect suspicion, think fast enough.  "Never mind," said Remus, sighed. "I guess who." The faintly scarred face pinched disapproval. "What thing tell -"  "Did father extenuating circumstances?" Harry said. "Poor home life, something like that? Or just... naturally nasty?" Cold?  Remus's hand swept hair back, first nervous gesture Harry seen him. "Harry," Remus said, "you can't judge father young boy!"  "I'm young boy," Harry said, "and I judge myself."  Remus blinked twice that.  "I want know why," Harry said. "I want understand, me, seems like possible excuse that!" Voice shaking bit. "Please tell anything know it, even sound nice."  So I fall trap myself, whatever is.  "It thing Gryffindor," Remus said, slowly, reluctantly. "And... I think back then, I thought way around, but... might Black got James it, really... Black wanted much show everyone Slytherin, see, wanted believe blood destiny -"   "No, Harry," said Remus. "I know Black went Peter instead running. It though Black making tragedy sake tragedy day." The man's voice unsteady. "There hint, warning, thought - think -" Remus's voice cut off.  Harry crying, help it, hurt worse hear Remus anything he'd ever felt himself. Harry lost two parents remember, knew stories. Remus Lupin lost four best friends less twenty-four hours; loss last remaining one, Peter Pettigrew, there'd reason all.  "Sometimes still hurts think Azkaban," Remus finished, voice almost whisper. "I glad, Harry, Death Eaters allowed visitors. It means I feel ashamed going."  Harry swallow hard several times could speak. "Can tell Peter Pettigrew? He father's friend, seems - I know, I remember -"  Remus nodded, water glittering eyes now. "I think, Harry, Peter known would end way -" man's voice choked up. "Peter afraid Dark Lord us, he'd known would end way, I think would done it. But Peter knew risk, Harry, knew risk real, could happen, yet stayed James Lily's side. All Hogwarts I used wonder Peter sorted Slytherin, maybe Ravenclaw, Peter adored secrets, resist them, would find things people, things wanted kept hidden -" A brief wry look crossed Remus's face. "But use secrets, Harry. He wanted know. And Dark Lord's shadow fell everything, Peter stood James Lily put talents good use, I understood Hat sent Gryffindor." Remus's voice fierce now, proud. "It's easy stand friends hero like Godric, bold strong like people think Gryffindors be. But Peter afraid us, also make brave?"  "It does," Harry said. His voice choked almost talk. "If could, Mr. Lupin, time, there's someone else I think hear Peter Pettigrew's story, student first-year Hufflepuff, named Neville Longbottom."  "Alice Frank's boy," said Remus, voice turning sad. "I see. It happy story, Harry, I tell again, think help him."  Harry nodded.  A brief silence fell.  "Did Black unfinished business Peter Pettigrew?" Harry said. "Anything would make seek Mr. Pettigrew, even killing matter? Like secret Mr. Pettigrew knew, Black wanted know himself, wanted kill hide?"  Something flickered Remus's eyes, older man shook head, said, "Not really."  "That means something," said Harry.  That wry smile appeared beneath salt-and-pepper mustache. "You bit Peter yourself, I see. But important, Harry."  "I'm Ravenclaw, I'm supposed resist temptation secrets. And," Harry said seriously, "if worth Black getting caught, I can't help think might matter."  Remus looked quite uncomfortable. "I suppose I could tell older, really, Harry, important! Just something school days."  Harry put finger exactly tipped off; might something exact tone nervousness Remus's voice, way man said older, sparked sudden leap Harry's intuition...  "Actually," said Harry, "I think I've sort guessed already, sorry."  Remus raised eyebrows. "Have you?" He sounded bit skeptical.  "They lovers, they?"  There awkward pause.  Remus gave slow, grave nod.  "Once," Remus said. "A long time ago. A sad affair, ending vast tragedy, seemed us young." The unhappy puzzlement plain face. "But I thought long since done buried beneath adult friendship, day Black killed Peter."   Chapter 43: Humanism, Pt 1  The gentle sun January shone cold fields outside Hogwarts.  For students study hour, others let class. The first-years who'd signed practicing certain spell, spell advantageously learned outdoors, beneath bright sun clear blue sky, rather within confines classroom. Cookies lemonade also considered helpful.  The early gestures spell complex precise; twitched wand once, twice, thrice, four times small tilts exactly right relative angles, shifted forefinger thumb exactly right distances...  The Ministry thought meant futile try teach anyone spell fifth year. There known cases younger children learning it, dismissed "genius".  It might polite way putting it, Harry beginning see Professor Quirrell claimed Ministry Committee Curriculum would greater benefit wizardkind used landfill.  So gestures complicated delicate. That stop learning eleven. It meant extra careful practice part lot longer usual, all.  Most Charms could learned older students like required strength magic young student could muster. But Patronus Charm like that, difficult needed much magic, difficult took mere magic.  It took warm, happy feelings kept close heart, loving memories, different kind strength need ordinary spells.  Harry twitched wand once, twice, thrice four times, shifted fingers exactly right distances...  "Good luck school, Harry. Do think I bought enough books?"  "You never enough books... certainly tried, really, really, really good try..."  It brought tears eyes, first time Harry remembered tried put spell.  Harry brought wand around brandished it, gesture precise, bold defiant.  "Expecto Patronum!" cried Harry.  Nothing happened.  Not single flicker light.  When Harry looked up, Remus Lupin still studying wand, rather troubled look faintly scarred face.  Finally Remus shook head. "I'm sorry, Harry," man said quietly. "Your wandwork exactly right."  And flicker light anywhere else, either, first-years supposed practicing Patronus Charms glancing corners eyes Harry instead.  The tears threatening come back Harry's eyes, happy tears. Of things, things, Harry never expected this.  There something horribly humiliating informed happy enough.  What Anthony Goldstein inside Harry didn't, made Anthony's wand shine bright light?  Did Anthony love father more?  "What thought using cast it?" said Remus.  "My father," Harry said, voice trembling. "I asked buy books I came Hogwarts, did, expensive, asked enough -"  Harry try explain Verres family motto.  "Take rest try different thought, Harry," said Remus. He gestured toward students sitting ground, looking disappointed embarrassed regretful. "You able cast Patronus Charm feeling ashamed grateful enough." There gentle compassion Mr. Lupin's voice, moment, Harry felt like hitting something.  Instead Harry turned around, stalked failures sitting. The students whose wandwork also proclaimed perfect, supposed searching happier thoughts; looks making much progress. There many robes trimmed dark blue, handful red, one lone Hufflepuff girl still crying. The Slytherins even bothered showing up, except Daphne Greengrass Tracey Davis, still trying get gestures.  Harry plopped cold dead grass winter, next student whose failure surprised most.  "So either," Hermione said. She'd fled field first, she'd come back that, look closely reddened eyes see she'd crying.  "I," Harry said, "I, I'd probably feel lot worse failed, nicest, person I know, I've ever met, Hermione, also can't it, means I might still be, good..."  "I gone Gryffindor," Hermione whispered. She blinked hard times, wipe eyes.   The boy girl walked forward together, definitely holding hands, drawing kind strength other's presence, something let ignore whispers year-mates, walked hallway approaching great doors Hogwarts.  Harry able cast Patronus Charm matter happy thought tried. People seemed surprised that, made even worse. Hermione able either. People surprised that, Harry seen starting get sidelong looks him. The Ravenclaws who'd failed getting looks. But Hermione Sunshine General, fans treating like she'd failed them, somehow, like she'd betrayed promise she'd never made.  The two gone library research Patronus Charm, Hermione's way dealing distress, sometimes also Harry's. Study, learn, try understand why...  The books confirmed Headmaster told Harry; often, wizards cast Patronus Charm practice would able presence real Dementor, going flat failure way full corporeal Patronus. It defied logic, Dementor's aura fear ought make harder wield happy thought; way was.  So two going give one last try, way either give one last try.  It day Dementor came Hogwarts.  Earlier, Harry unTransfigured father's rock usually rested pinky ring form tiny diamond, placed huge gray stone back pouch. Just case Harry's magic failed entirely, confronted darkest creatures.  Harry already started feel pessimistic, even front Dementor yet.  "I bet I can't," Harry said whisper. "I bet that's happens."  "It felt wrong me," Hermione said, voice even quieter his. "I tried morning I realized. When I brandish end, even I said words, felt wrong."  Harry say anything. He'd felt thing, right start, though taken another five attempts using five happy thoughts he'd able acknowledge himself. Every time tried brandish wand, felt hollow; spell trying learn fit him.  "It mean we're going Dark Wizards," said Harry. "Lots people can't cast Patronus Charm Dark Wizards. Godric Gryffindor Dark Wizard..."  Godric defeated Dark Lords, fought protect commoners Noble Houses Muggles wizards. He'd many fine friends true, lost half one good cause another. He'd listened screams wounded, armies he'd raised defend innocent; young wizards courage rallied calls, he'd buried afterward. Until finally, wizardry begun fail old age, he'd brought together three powerful wizards era raise Hogwarts bare ground; one great accomplishment Godric's name war, kind war, matter just. It Salazar, Godric, who'd taught first Hogwarts class Battle Magic. Godric taught first Hogwarts class Herbology, magics green growing life.  To last day he'd never able cast Patronus Charm.  Godric Gryffindor good man, happy one.  Harry believe angst, stand reading whiny heroes, knew billion people world would given anything trade places him, and...  And deathbed, Godric told Helga (for Salazar abandoned him, Rowena passed before) regret it, warning students follow footsteps, one ever say he'd told anyone follow footsteps. If right thing do, tell anyone else choose wrongly, even youngest student Hogwarts. And yet follow footsteps, hoped would remember Gryffindor told House right happier him. That red gold would bright warm colors, on.  And Helga promised him, weeping, Headmistress would make sure it.  Whereupon Godric died, left ghost behind him; Harry shoved book back Hermione walked away little, see crying.  You think book innocent title like "The Patronus Charm: Wizards Who Could Couldn't" would saddest book Harry ever read.  Harry...  Harry want that.  To book.  Harry want that.  The rest school seemed think No Patronus meant Bad Person, plain simple. Somehow fact Godric Gryffindor also able cast Patronus Charm seemed get repeated. Maybe people talk respect last wish, Fred George probably know Harry certainly tell them. Or maybe failures mention less shameful, smaller loss pride status, thought Dark rather unhappy.  Harry saw Hermione, beside him, blinking hard; wondered thinking Rowena Ravenclaw, who'd also loved books.  "Okay," Harry whispered. "Happier thoughts. If go full corporeal Patronus, think animal be?"  "An otter," Hermione said once.  "An otter?" Harry whispered incredulously.  "Yes, otter," said Hermione. "What yours?"  "Peregrine falcon," Harry said without hesitation. "It dive faster three hundred kilometers per hour, fastest living creature is." The peregrine falcon Harry's favorite animal since forever. Harry determined become Animagus someday, get form, fly strength wings, see land sharper eyes... "But otter?"  Hermione smiled, say anything.  And vast doors Hogwarts swung open.  They walked time, children, pathway led toward unforbidden forest, continued forest itself. The Sun lowering near horizon, shadows long, sunlight filtered bare branches winter trees; January, first-years last learn, day.  Then path swerved took new direction, saw distance, clearing forest, sere winter grounds, yellowing dried grass whitened small remnants snow.  The human figures still small range. The two spots dim white light Aurors' Patronuses, brighter spot silver light Headmaster's, next something...  Harry squinted.  Something...  It must purely Harry's imagination, way Dementor reach past three corporeal Patronuses, thought could feel touch emptiness brushing mind, brushing straight soft inner center without respect Occlumency barriers.   Seamus Finnigan ashen trembling rejoined students milling withered snow-spotted grass. Seamus's Patronus Charm successful, still interval Headmaster dispelled Patronus supposed cast own, faced Dementor's fear unshielded.  Up twenty seconds exposure five paces certainly safe, even eleven-year-old wizard weak resistance still-maturing brain. There lot variance hard Dementor's power hit people, another thing quite understood; twenty seconds definitely safe.  Forty seconds Dementor exposure five paces might possibly enough cause permanent damage, though sensitive subjects.  It harsh training even standards Hogwarts, way learned fly hippogriff tossed one told get going. Harry fan overprotectiveness, looked difference maturity fourth-year Hogwarts fourteen-year-old Muggle, clear Muggles smothering children... even Harry started wonder pushing it. Not every hurt could healed afterward.  But cast spell conditions, meant rely using Patronus Charm defend yourself; overconfidence even dangerous wizards Muggles. Dementors could drain magic physical vitality, happy thoughts, meant might able Apparate away waited long, recognize approaching fear Dementor within range attack. (During reading, Harry discovered considerable horror books claimed Dementor's Kiss would eat soul reason permanent mindless coma put victims. And wizards believed deliberately used Dementor's Kiss execute criminals. It certainty called criminals innocent, even weren't, destroying souls? If Harry believed souls, would have... drawn blank, think appropriate response that.)  The Headmaster taking security seriously, three Aurors standing guard. Their leader Asianish-looking man, solemn without grim, Auror Komodo, whose wand never left hand. His Patronus, orangutan solid moonlight, paced back forth Dementor first-years awaiting turn; beside orangutan moved bright white panther Auror Butnaru, man piercing gaze, long black hair ponytail, long braided goatee. Those two Aurors, two Patronuses, watching Dementor. On opposite side students resting Auror Goryanof, tall thin pale unshaven, sitting back chair he'd conjured without word wand, maintaining absentminded pokerface scanned entire scene. Professor Quirrell shown long first-years began attempts, eyes never strayed far Harry. The tiny Professor Flitwick, champion duellist, fiddling absently wand; eyes, peering within huge puffy beard served face, stayed focused Professor Quirrell.  And must Harry's imagination, Professor Quirrell seemed wince slightly time Headmaster's Patronus winked test next student. Maybe Professor Quirrell imagining placebo effect Harry, backwash emptiness caressing mind.  "Anthony Goldstein," called voice Headmaster.  Harry quietly walked toward Seamus, even Anthony began approach shining silver phoenix, and... whatever beneath tattered cloak.  "What see?" Harry asked Seamus low voice.  A lot students answered Harry, he'd tried gather data; Seamus Finnigan Chaos, one Harry's lieutenants. Maybe fair, but...  "Dead," said Seamus whisper, "grayish slimy... dead left water while... "  Harry nodded. "That's lot people see," Harry said. He projected confidence, even though fake, Seamus needed it. "Go eat chocolate, feel better."  Seamus nodded stumbled toward table healing sweets.  "Expecto Patronum!" cried young boy's voice.  Then gasps shock, even Aurors.  Harry spun around look -  There brilliant silver bird standing Anthony Goldstein cage. The bird reared head let cry, cry also silver, bright hard beautiful metal.  And something back Harry's mind said, that's peregrine falcon, I'm going strangle sleep.  Shut up, Harry said thought, want us Dark Wizard?  What's point? You're going end one eventually.  That... something Harry would usually thought...  It's placebo effect, Harry told again. The Dementor can't actually get three corporeal Patronuses, I'm imagining I think like. When I actually face Dementor, it'll feel completely different, I'll know I silly before.  A slight chill went Harry's spine then, feeling yes, would completely different, positive direction.  The blazing silver phoenix sprang back existence Headmaster's wand, lesser bird vanished; Anthony Goldstein began walk back.  The Headmaster coming Anthony instead calling next name, Patronus waiting behind guard Dementor.  Harry glanced Hermione standing, behind glowing panther. Hermione's turn would come next, apparently delayed.  She looked stressed.  Earlier, she'd politely asked Harry please stop trying destress her.  Dumbledore smiling slightly escorted Anthony back toward others; smiling slightly, Headmaster looked very, tired.  "Unbelievable," said Dumbledore voice sounded much weaker accustomed boom. "A corporeal Patronus, first year. And astounding number successes among young students. Quirinus, I must acknowledge proved point."  Professor Quirrell inclined head. "A simple enough guess, I think. A Dementor attacks fear, children less afraid."  "Less afraid?" said Auror Goryanof sitting.  "So I said well," said Dumbledore. "And Professor Quirrell pointed adults courage, less fear; thought, I confess, never occurred before."  "That precise phrasing," Professor Quirrell said dryly, "but do. And rest agreement, Headmaster?"  "As say," Dumbledore said reluctantly. "I admit I expecting lose wager, Quirinus, proven wisdom."  All students looking them, puzzled; except Hermione, staring direction cage tall decaying robes; Harry, watching everyone, since imagining feeling paranoid.  Professor Quirrell said, tones invite comments, "I allowed teach Killing Curse students wish learn it. Which render considerably safer Dark Wizards pests, foolish think otherwise know deadly magics." Professor Quirrell paused, eyes narrowing. "Headmaster, I respectfully observe looking well. I suggest leaving remainder day's task Professor Flitwick."  Dumbledore shook head. "We almost done day, Quirinus. I last."  Hermione approached Anthony. "Captain Goldstein," said, voice trembled little, "can give advice?"  "Don't afraid," Anthony said firmly. "Don't think anything tries make think about. You're holding wand front shield fear, brandishing wand drive fear away, that's make happy thought something solid..." Anthony shrugged helplessly. "I mean, I heard before, but..."  Other students starting congregate around Anthony, questions.  "Miss Granger?" Headmaster said. His voice might gentle, weakened.  Hermione straightened shoulders, followed him.  "What see cloak?" Harry said Anthony.  Anthony looked Harry, surprised, answered, "A tall man dead, I mean, sort dead-shaped dead-colored... hurt see I knew Dementor trying get me."  Harry looked back Hermione confronting cage cloak.  Hermione raised wand position first gestures.  The Headmaster's phoenix winked existence.  And Hermione gave tiny, pathetic shriek, flinched -  - took step back, Harry could see wand moving, brandished said "Expecto Patronum!"  Nothing happened.  Hermione turned ran.  "Expecto Patronum!" said Headmaster's deeper voice, silver phoenix blazed back life.  The young girl stumbled, kept running, strange sounds beginning come throat.  "Hermione!" Susan yelled it, Hannah, Daphne, Ernie, started run toward her; even Harry, always thinking one step ahead, spun heel ran table chocolate.  Even Harry shoved chocolate Hermione's mouth she'd chewed swallowed, still breathing great gasps crying, eyes still seemed unfocused.  She can't permanently Demented, Harry thought desperately confusion inside him, horrible fear deathly fury beginning twist around other, can't been, exposed even ten seconds let alone forty -  But could temporarily Demented, Harry realized moment, rule temporarily injured Dementor ten seconds sensitive enough.  Then Hermione's eyes seemed focus, dart around, settle him.  "Harry," gasped, students went silent. "Harry, don't. Don't!"  Harry suddenly afraid ask do, worst memories, sleep's nightmare reliving waking life?  "Don't go near it!" said Hermione. Her hand reached out, grabbed lapel robes. "You go near it, Harry! It spoke me, Harry, knows you, knows here!"  "What -" Harry said, cursed asking.  "The Dementor!" said Hermione. Her voice rose shriek. "Professor Quirrell wants eat you!"  In sudden hush, Professor Quirrell came forward steps; approach closer (Harry there, all). "Miss Granger," said, voice grave, "I think chocolate."  "Professor Flitwick, let Harry try, send back!"  The Headmaster arrived then, and Professor Flitwick exchanging worried looks.  "I hear Dementor speak," Headmaster said. "Still..."  "Just ask," said Professor Quirrell, sounding little weary.  "Did Dementor say would get Harry?" said Headmaster.  "All tastiest parts first," said Hermione, "it would - would eat -"  Hermione blinked. Some sanity seemed come back eyes.  Then started crying.  "You brave, Hermione Granger," Headmaster said. His voice gentle, clearly audible. "Too much braver I comprehended. You turned run, endured tried complete Charm. When older stronger, Miss Granger, I know try again, I know succeed."  "I'm sorry," Hermione said gasps, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry... I'm sorry, Harry, I can't tell I saw, I look it, I dare look it, I knew horrible ever seen..."  It Harry, he'd hesitated, hands chocolatey; Ernie Susan there, helping Hermione she'd fallen grass, leading toward snacks table.  Five bars chocolate later, Hermione seemed right again, went apologized Professor Quirrell; always watching Harry, every time glanced direction. He'd stepped toward once, stopped she'd stepped away. Her eyes silently apologized, silently pleaded leave be.   Neville Longbottom seen something dead half-dissolved, oozing running face like squashed sponge.  It worst thing anyone yet described seeing. Neville able produce small flicker light wand before, had, intelligently great presence mind, turned run away instead trying cast Patronus Charm.  (The Headmaster said nothing students, told one else less brave; Professor Quirrell calmly observed made mistake warned, ignorance became stupidity.)  "Professor Quirrell?" Harry said low voice, come close Defense Professor dared. "What see -"  "Don't ask." The voice flat.  Harry nodded respectfully. "What original phrasing Headmaster, I ask?"  Dryly. "Our worst memories grow worse grow older."  "Ah," Harry said. "Logical."  Something strange flickered Professor Quirrell's eyes, then, looked Harry. "Let us hope," Professor Quirrell said, "that succeed upon try, Mr. Potter. For do, Headmaster may teach trick using Patronus send messages cannot forged intercepted, military importance impossible overstate. It would tremendous advantage Chaos Legion, someday, I suspect, entire country. But succeed, Mr. Potter... well, I shall understand."   Morag MacDougal said, wavering voice, "Ouch", Dumbledore recast Patronus right away.  Parvati Patil produced corporeal Patronus form tiger, larger Dumbledore's phoenix, though nearly bright. There great burst applause watchers, though shock Anthony done it.  And Harry's turn.  The Headmaster called name Harry Potter, Harry afraid.  Harry knew, knew going fail, knew going hurt.  But still try; sometimes, presence Dementor, wizard went flicker light full corporeal Patronus, one understood why.  And Harry defend Dementors, able recognize approach, recognize feeling mind, run late.  What worst memory...?  Harry expected Headmaster give worried look, hopeful look, deeply wise advice; instead Albus Dumbledore watched quiet calm.  He thinks I'm going fail, sabotage telling so, thought Harry, true words encouragement speak, would speak them...  The cage came closer. It already tarnished, rusted away nothing, yet.  The cloak came closer. It unraveling shot unpatched holes; new morning, Auror Goryanof said.  "Headmaster?" Harry said. "What see?"  The Headmaster's voice also calm. "The Dementors creatures fear, fear Dementor diminishes, fearsomeness form. I see tall, thin, naked man. He decaying. He slightly painful look upon. That all. What see, Harry?"  ...Harry see cloak.  Or right, mind refusing see cloak...  No, mind trying see wrong thing cloak, Harry could feel it, eyes trying force mistake. But Harry done best train notice tiny feeling confusion, automatically flinch away making stuff up; every time mind tried start inventing lie cloak, reflex fast enough shut down.  Harry looked cloak saw...  An open question. Harry let mind see something false, see anything, like part visual cortex getting signal ceasing exist. There blind spot cloak. Harry know there.  Just far worse decaying mummy.  The unseeable horror beneath cloak close, now, blazing bird moonlight, white phoenix, yet lay them.  Harry wanted run away like students had. Half ones who'd luck Patronus Charms shown today first place. Of remaining, half fled Headmaster even dispelled Patronus, one said word. There'd little laughter Terry turned walked back try; Susan Hannah, who'd gone before, yelled everyone shut up.  But Harry Boy-Who-Lived, would lose much respect seen give without even trying...  Pride roles seemed diminish fall away, presence whatever lay beneath cloak.  Why I still here?  It shame others thinking cowardly, kept Harry's feet place.  It hope repairing reputation brought wand.  It desire master Patronus Charm magic, moved fingers initial position.  It something else, something oppose whatever lay beneath cloak, true darkness Harry find whether lay within him, power drive back.  Harry planned try one final time think book-shopping spree father, instead, last minute, facing Dementor, different memory occurred him, something tried before; thought warm happy ordinary way, felt righter, somehow.  And Harry remembered stars, remembered burning terribly bright unwavering Silent Night; let image fill him, fill like Occlumency barrier across entire mind, became bodiless awareness void.  The bright silver shining phoenix vanished.  And Dementor smashed mind like fist God.  FEAR / COLD / DARKNESS  There instant two forces clashed head-on, peaceful starlit memory held fear, even Harry's fingers began wand motions, practiced become automatic. They warm happy, blazing points light perfect blackness; image Dementor could easily pierce. For silent burning stars vast unafraid, shine cold darkness natural state.  But flaw, crack, fault-line immovable object trying resist irresistible force. Harry felt twinge anger Dementor trying feed him, like slipping wet ice. Harry's mind began slide sideways, bitterness, black fury, deathly hatred -  Harry's wand came final brandish.  It felt wrong.  "Expecto Patronum," voice spoke, words hollow pointless.  And Harry fell dark side, fell dark side, faster deeper ever before, down slide accelerated, Dementor latched onto exposed vulnerable parts fed them, eating away light. A fading reflex scrabbled warmth, even image Hermione came him, image Mum Dad, Dementor twisted it, showed Hermione lying dead ground, corpses mother father, even sucked away.  Into vacuum rose memory, worst memory, something forgotten long ago neural patterns still existed.  "Lily, take Harry go! It's him!" shouted man's voice. "Go! Run! I'll hold off!"  And Harry help think, empty depths dark side, ridiculously overconfident James Potter been. Hold Lord Voldemort? With what?  Then voice spoke, high-pitched like hiss teakettle, like dry ice laid Harry's every nerve, like brand metal cooled liquid helium temperatures laid every part him. And voice said:  "Avadakedavra."  (The wand flew boy's nerveless fingers body began convulse fall, Headmaster's eyes widening alarm began Patronus Charm.)  "Not Harry, Harry, please Harry!" screamed woman's voice.  Whatever left Harry listened light drained him, dead void heart, wondered thought Lord Voldemort would stop asked politely.  "Step aside, woman!" said shrill voice burning cold. "For I come, boy."  "Not Harry! Please... mercy... mercy..."  Lily Potter, Harry thought, seemed understand type people became Dark Lords first place; best strategy could conceive save child's life, final failure mother.  "I give rare chance flee," said shrill voice. "But I trouble subdue you, death save child. Step aside, foolish woman, sense all!"  "Not Harry, please no, take me, kill instead!"  The empty thing Harry wondered Lily Potter seriously imagined Lord Voldemort would say yes, kill her, depart leaving son unharmed.  "Very well," said voice death, sounding coldly amused, "I accept bargain. Yourself die, child live. Now drop wand I murder you."  There hideous silence.  Lord Voldemort began laugh, horrible contemptuous laughter.  And then, last, Lily Potter's voice shrieked desperate hate, "Avada ke-"  The lethal voice finished first, curse rapid precise.  "Avadakedavra."  A blinding flare green marked end Lily Potter.  And boy crib saw it, eyes, two crimson eyes, seeming glow bright red, blaze like miniature suns, filling Harry's whole vision locked -   The children saw Harry Potter fall, heard Harry Potter scream, thin high-pitched scream seemed pierce ears like knives.  There brilliant silver flash Headmaster bellowed "Expecto Patronum!" blazing phoenix returned being.  But Harry Potter's horrible scream went on on, even Headmaster scooped boy arms bore away Dementor, even Neville Longbottom Professor Flitwick went chocolate time -  Hermione knew it, knew saw it, knew nightmare real, coming true, somehow coming true.  "Get chocolate!" demanded voice Professor Quirrell, pointlessly, Professor Flitwick's tiny form already cannonballing toward Headmaster racing toward students.  Hermione moving forward herself, though know else meant -  "Cast Patronuses!" shouted Headmaster, brought Harry behind Aurors. "Everyone can! Get Harry Dementor! It's still feeding him!"  There moment frozen horror.  "Expecto Patronum!" shouted Professor Flitwick Auror Goryanof, Anthony Goldstein, failed first time, Parvati Patil, succeeded, Anthony tried silver bird spread wings screamed Dementor, Dean Thomas roared words like written letters fire wand gave birth towering white bear; eight blazing Patronuses line Harry Dementor, Harry went screaming screaming Headmaster laid dried grass.  Hermione cast Patronus Charm, ran toward Harry lay. In mind, something tried guess long already. Was twenty seconds? More?  There dreadful agony bewilderment face Albus Dumbledore. His long black wand hand, spoke spells, looked Harry's convulsing body horror -  Hermione know do, know do, understand happening, powerful wizard world seemed equally loss.  "Use phoenix!" bellowed Professor Quirrell. "Take far away Dementor!"  Without single word Headmaster scooped Harry arms vanished crack fire along suddenly appearing Fawkes; Headmaster's Patronus winked out, guarded Dementor.  Horror confusion sudden babble.  "Mr. Potter recover," Professor Quirrell said, raising voice, tone calm again, "I think twenty seconds."  Then blazing white phoenix appeared again, like flying elsewhere, Hermione Granger came creature moonlight, cried Albus Dumbledore's voice:  "It still feeds him, even here! How? If know, Hermione Granger, must tell me! Tell me!"  The senior Auror turned stare her, many students. Professor Flitwick turn, leveling wand Professor Quirrell, holding clearly empty hands.  Seconds ticked past, uncounted.  She remember it, remember nightmare clearly, remember thought possible, afraid -  Hermione realized ought do, hardest decision life.  What whatever happened Harry, happened too?  All limbs cold death, vision gone dark, fear overwhelming everything; she'd seen Harry dying, Mum Dad dying, friends dying, everyone dying, end, died, would alone. That secret nightmare she'd never talked anyone, given Dementor power her, loneliest thing die alone.  She want go place again, she, didn't, want stay forever -  You courage enough Gryffindor, said calm voice Sorting Hat memory, right House I give you. You learn, stand friends, House choose. So afraid, Hermione Granger, decide belong...  There time deciding, Harry dying.  "I can't remember now," said Hermione, voice cracking, "but hold on, I'll go front Dementor again..."  She started run toward Dementor.  "Miss Granger!" squeaked Professor Flitwick, made move stop her, kept holding wand Professor Quirrell.  "Everyone!" shouted Auror Komodo voice military command. "Get Patronuses way!"  "FLITWICK!" roared Professor Quirrell. "SUMMON POTTER'S WAND!"  Even Hermione understood, Professor Flitwick already crying "Accio!", saw stick wood zooming lain almost touching Dementor's cage.   The eyes opened, dead vacant.  "Harry!" gasped voice colorless world. "Harry! Speak me!"  The face Albus Dumbledore leaned field vision, occupied distant marble ceiling.  "You're annoying," said empty voice. "You die."   Chapter 44: Humanism, Pt 2  "Fawkes," said Albus Dumbledore, voice cracking, "help him, please -"  A brilliant creature red-gold shuffled field vision, looking quizzically; began croon.  The meaningless chirps slid emptiness, nothing onto could hold.  "You're noisy," said voice, "you die."  "Chocolate," Albus Dumbledore said, "you need chocolate, friends - I dare take back -"  Then shining raven came, spoke Professor Flitwick's voice; whereupon Albus Dumbledore gasped sudden comprehension, cursed aloud stupidity.  The empty thing laughed that, retained capacity amused.  And moment later vanished another flash fire.   It moment, seemed, Flitwick's raven flown elsewhere, Albus Dumbledore reappeared another crack red golden fire Harry arms; somehow time Hermione already managed fill hands chocolate.  Before Hermione even got there, chocolate zoomed table straight Harry's mouth, tiny part mind said unfair, he'd gotten chance -  Harry spat chocolate back again.  "Go away," said voice empty even cold.  ...  Everything seemed freeze, everyone moving toward Harry halted, movements broken shock two dead words.  Then: "No," said Albus Dumbledore, "I not," time resumed again, even another piece chocolate zoomed table Harry's mouth.  Hermione close enough could see Harry's expression become hateful, mouth chewed mechanical, unnatural rhythm.  The Headmaster's voice grim iron. "Filius, call Minerva, tell must come speed."  Professor Flitwick whispered silver raven, flew air vanished.  Another piece chocolate floated Harry's mouth, mechanical chewing continued.  There students gathering around Headmaster watched Harry grim eyes: Neville, Seamus, Dean, Lavender, Ernie, Terry, Anthony, none daring approach closer Hermione had.  "What do?" said Dean trembling voice.  "Back give space -" said dry voice Professor Quirrell.  "No!" interrupted Headmaster. "Let surrounded friends."  Harry swallowed chocolate, said empty voice, "They're stupid. They diemmmppphhh" another piece chocolate entered mouth.  Hermione saw looks shock crossed faces.  "He mean it, he?" Seamus said like begging.  "You understand," Hermione said, voice breaking, "that's Harry -" shut said anything more, say much.  She saw look face Neville understood, also saw others didn't. If Harry really never thought anything like that, exposed Dementor less minute made say it. That's probably thinking.  Less minute Dementor exposure create whole new evil person inside nothing.  But person already -  Does Headmaster know?  Hermione looked Headmaster, found Albus Dumbledore gazing her, blue eyes grown suddenly piercing -  Words came mind.  Do speak it, said Dumbledore her.  You know, thought Hermione. About dark side.  I know. But beyond even that. Fawkes's song cannot reach him, lost.  What -  I plan, sent Headmaster. Patience.  Something tenor thought made Hermione nervous. What sort plan?  It better know, sent Headmaster.  Now Hermione getting really nervous. She know much Headmaster knew Harry's dark side -  A fair point, sent Headmaster. I tell you; steel react. Are ready? Good. I going pretend cast Killing Curse Professor McGonagall - DO NOT REACT, Hermione!  That took work. The Headmaster really crazy! That bring Harry dark side, Harry would go completely berserk, he'd kill Headmaster -  But true darkness, sent Albus Dumbledore. That protectiveness, love. Fawkes able reach him, then. And Harry sees Minerva alive all, return fully.  The thought came Hermione -  I doubt work, sent Headmaster, may like way reacts try. But may try wish.  She really meant seriously! It -  Then eyes moved, breaking gaze Headmaster, going boy looking around empty, despising eyes mouth kept chewing swallowing bar bar chocolate without effect. Her heart wrenched, suddenly lot things seem matter, chance.   There compulsion chew swallow chocolate. The response compulsion killing.  People gathered around stared. That annoying. The response annoyance killing.  Other people chattering background. That insolent. The response insolence inflict pain, since none useful, killing would simpler.  Killing people would difficult. But many trust Quirrell, strong. Finding exactly right trigger could cause kill other.  Then person leaned field vision something completely strange, something belonged foreign mode thought, single response stored anywhere -   She heard gasps around her, matter, maintained kiss chocolate-smeared lips tears welled eyes.  And Harry's arms came pushed away, lips yelled, "I told you, kissing!"   "I think he'll right now," Headmaster said, looking Harry crying great wretched sobs Fawkes crooned him. "Excellently done, Miss Granger. Do know, even I would expected actually work?"  The phoenix's song meant her, Hermione knew, could still soothed it, needed, life officially over.   Chapter 45: Humanism, Pt 3  Fawkes's song gently trailed nothing.  Harry sat lain winter-blasted grass, Fawkes still perched shoulder.  There intakes breath around him.  "Harry," said Seamus wavering voice, "are right?"  The peace phoenix still him, warmth, Fawkes perched. Warmth, spreading him, memory song, still alive phoenix's presence. There terrible things happened him, terrible thoughts passed him. He regained impossible memory, Dementor made desecrate it. A strange word kept echoing mind. And could put hold later, phoenix still shone red gold beneath setting sun.  Fawkes cawed him.  "Something I do?" Harry said Fawkes. "What?"  Fawkes bobbed head direction Dementor.  Harry looked unseeable horror still cage, back phoenix, puzzled.  "Mr. Potter?" said Minerva McGonagall's voice behind him. "Are right?"  Harry climbed feet turned.  Minerva McGonagall looking him, looking worried; Albus Dumbledore beside studying carefully; Filius Flitwick appeared tremendously relieved; students plain staring.  "I think so, Professor McGonagall," Harry said calmly. He'd almost said Minerva managing stop himself. While Fawkes shoulder, least, Harry fine; might would collapse moment Fawkes left, somehow thoughts like seem important. "I think I'm okay."  There ought cheering, sighs relief, something, one seemed know say, one all.  The peace phoenix lingered.  Harry turned back. "Hermione?" said.  Everyone tiniest smidgin romance hearts held breath.  "I really know say thank graciously," Harry said quietly, "any I know apologize. All I say wondering whether right thing do, was."  The boy girl gazed other's eyes.  "Sorry," Harry said. "About happens next. If there's anything I -"  "No," Hermione said back. "There isn't. It's right, though." Then turned Harry walked away, toward path led back gates Hogwarts.  A number girls gave Harry puzzled looks, followed her. As went, could hear excited questions starting.  Harry looked left, turned back look students. They'd seen ground, screaming, and...  Fawkes nuzzled cheek, briefly.  ...and would help them, someday, understanding Boy-Who-Lived could also hurt, could wretched. So hurt wretched themselves, would remember seeing Harry writhing ground, know pain troubles mean they'd never amount anything. Had Headmaster calculated that, let students stay watch?  Harry's eyes went back tall tattered cloak, almost absentmindedly, without really aware speaking, Harry said, "It ought exist."  "Ah," said dry, precise voice. "I thought might say that. I sorry tell you, Mr. Potter, Dementors cannot killed. Many tried."  "Really?" Harry said, still absentmindedly. "What try?"  "There certain extremely dangerous destructive spell," Professor Quirrell said, "which I name here; spell cursed fire. It would use destroy ancient device Sorting Hat. It effect Dementors. They undying."  "They undying," said Headmaster. The words mild, gaze sharp. "They possess eternal life. They wounds world, attacking wound makes larger."  "Hm," Harry said. "Suppose threw Sun? Would destroyed?"  "Throw Sun?" squeaked Professor Flitwick, looking like wanted faint.  "It seems unlikely, Mr. Potter," Professor Quirrell said dryly. "The Sun large, all; I doubt Dementor would much effect it. But test I would like try, Mr. Potter, case."  "I see," Harry said.  Fawkes cawed final time, mantled wings around Harry's head, launched Harry. Launched straight toward Dementor, screaming great piercing cry defiance echoed around field. And anyone could react that, flash fire, Fawkes gone.  The peace faded, little.  The warmth faded, little.  Harry took deep breath, let again.  "Yep," Harry said. "Still alive."  Again silence, absence cheering; one seemed know respond -  "It good know fully recovered, Mr. Potter," Professor Quirrell said firmly, though deny possibility. "Now, I believe Miss Ransom next?"  That started bit argument, Professor Quirrell right everyone else wrong. The Defense Professor pointed that, despite understandable emotions concerned, chance similar mishap occurring student verged infinitesimal; knew avoid mischances wands. And meanwhile, students needed take best chance casting corporeal Patronus Charm, else learn feeling Dementor could flee, discover degree vulnerability...  In end turned Dean Thomas Ron Weasley Gryffindor ones left still willing go anywhere near Dementor, simplified argument.  Harry glanced Dementor's direction. The word echoed mind again.  All right, Harry thought himself, Dementor riddle, answer?  And like that, obvious.  Harry looked tarnished, slightly corroded cage.  He saw lay beneath tall, tattered cloak.  That it, then.  Professor McGonagall came spoke Harry. She seen worst it, slight glitter water eyes. Harry told needed talk afterward ask question he'd put while, need happen right now, busy. There certain look suggested pulled away something important; Harry observed her, said honestly need feel guilty leaving. This earned something sharp look, leave did, hurriedly, promise would talk later.  Dean Thomas cast white bear again, even Dementor's presence; Ron Weasley put adequate shield sparkling mist. Which concluded day, far everyone else concerned, Professor Flitwick began herd students back Hogwarts. When clear Harry meant stay behind, Professor Flitwick looked quizzically; Harry, part, glanced significantly Dumbledore. Harry know Professor Flitwick made that, sharp gaze warning, Head House departed.  And remained Harry, Professor Quirrell, Headmaster Dumbledore, Auror trio.  It would better get rid trio first, Harry think good way that.  "All right," said Auror Komodo, "let's take back."  "Excuse me," Harry said. "I'd like another go Dementor."   Harry's request met certain amount opposition completely insane variety, though Auror Butnaru actually said loud.  "Fawkes told to," Harry said.  This overcome opposition, despite look shock produced Dumbledore's face. The argument went on, starting wear edges phoenix's remaining peace, annoyed Harry, though little.  "Look," Harry said, "I'm pretty sure I know I wrong before. There's kind person use different sort warm happy thought. Just let try it, okay?"  This prove persuasive either.  "I think," Professor Quirrell said finally, staring Harry narrowed eyes, "that allow supervision, may, point another, sneak look Dementor own. Do I accuse falsely, Mr. Potter?"  There appalled pause this. It seemed like good time play trump card.  "I mind Headmaster keeps Patronus up," Harry said. For I presence Dementor same, Patronus no.  There confusion this, even Professor Quirrell looked puzzled; Headmaster finally acceded, since seem likely Harry could hurt four Patronuses.  If Dementor could reach Patronus level, Albus Dumbledore, would see naked man painful look upon...  Harry say loud, obvious reasons.  And began walk toward Dementor.  "Headmaster," Harry said, "suppose Ravenclaw door asked riddle: What lies center Dementor? What would say?"  "Fear," said Headmaster.  It simple enough mistake. The Dementor approached, fear came you. The fear hurt, felt fear weakening you, wanted fear go away.  It natural think fear problem.  So they'd concluded Dementor creature pure fear, nothing fear fear itself, Dementor hurt afraid...  But...  What lies center Dementor?  Fear.  What horrible mind refuses see it?  Fear.  What impossible kill?  Fear.  ...it quite fit, thought it.  Though clear enough people would reluctant look beyond first answer.  People understood fear.  People knew supposed fear.  So, faced Dementor, exactly comforting ask: 'What fear side effect rather main problem?'  They come close Dementor's cage guarded four Patronuses, came sharp intakes breath three Aurors Professor Quirrell. Everyone's faces turned look Dementor, seeming listen; horror Auror Goryanof's face.  Then Professor Quirrell raised head, face hard, spat toward Dementor.  "It like prey taken it, I suppose," Dumbledore said quietly. "Well. If becomes necessary, Quirinus, always refuge Hogwarts."  "What say?" said Harry.  Every head swung stare him.  "You hear it...?" Dumbledore said.  Harry shook head.  "It said me," said Professor Quirrell, "that knew me, would hunt someday, wherever I tried hide." His face rigid, showing fright.  "Ah," Harry said. "I worry that, Professor Quirrell." It's like Dementors actually talk, think; structure borrowed mind expectations...  Now everyone giving strange looks. The Aurors glancing nervously other, Dementor, Harry.  And stood directly Dementor's cage.  "They wounds world," Harry said. "It's wild guess, I'm guessing one said Godric Gryffindor."  "Yes..." said Dumbledore. "How know?"  It common misconception, thought Harry, best rationalists Sorted Ravenclaw, leaving none Houses. This so; Sorted Ravenclaw indicates strongest virtue curiosity, wondering desiring know true answer. And virtue rationalist needs. Sometimes work hard problem, stick while. Sometimes need clever plan finding out. And sometimes need anything else see answer, courage face it...  Harry's gaze went lay beneath cloak, horror far worse decaying mummy. Rowena Ravenclaw might also known, obvious enough riddle saw riddle.  And also obvious Patronuses animals. The animals know, sheltered fear.  But Harry knew, would always know, would never able forget. He'd tried teach face reality without flinching, though Harry yet mastered art, still grooves worn mind, learned reflex look toward painful thought instead away. Harry would never able forget thinking warm happy thoughts something else, spell worked him.  So Harry would think warm happy thought something else.  Harry drew forth wand Professor Flitwick returned him, put feet beginning stance Patronus Charm.  Within mind, Harry discarded last remnants peace phoenix, put aside calm, dreamlike state, remembered instead Fawkes's piercing cry, roused battle. Called upon pieces elements awaken. Raised within strength Patronus Charm could ever draw upon, put right frame mind final warm happy thought; remembered bright things.  The books father bought him.  Mum's smile Harry handmade mother's day card, elaborate thing used half pound spare electronics parts garage flash lights beep little tune, taken three days make.  Professor McGonagall telling parents died well, protecting him. As had.  Realizing Hermione keeping even running faster, could true rivals friends.  Coaxing Draco darkness, watching slowly move toward light.  Neville Seamus Lavender Dean everyone else looked him, everyone would fought protect anything threatened Hogwarts.  Everything made life worth living.  His wand rose starting position Patronus Charm.  Harry thought stars, image almost held Dementor even without Patronus. Only time, Harry added missing ingredient, he'd never truly seen he'd seen pictures video. The Earth, blazing blue white reflected sunlight hung space, amid black void brilliant points light. It belonged there, within image, gave everything else meaning. The Earth made stars significant, made uncontrolled fusion reactions, Earth would someday colonize galaxy, fulfill promise night sky.  Would still plagued Dementors, children's children's children, distant descendants humankind strode star star? No. Of course not. The Dementors little nuisances, paling nothingness light promise; unkillable, invincible, even close. You put little nuisances, one lucky unlucky born Earth; Ancient Earth, would remembered someday. That part meant alive, one tiny handful sentient beings born beginning things, intelligent life come fully power. That much vaster future depended here, now, earliest days dawn, still much darkness fought, temporary nuisances like Dementors.  Mum Dad, Hermione's friendship Draco's journey, Neville Seamus Lavender Dean, blue sky brilliant Sun bright things, Earth, stars, promise, everything humanity everything would become...  On wand, Harry's fingers moved starting positions; ready, now, think right sort warm happy thought.  And Harry's eyes stared directly lay beneath tattered cloak, looked straight named Dementor. The void, emptiness, hole universe, absence color space, open drain warmth poured world.  The fear exuded stole away happy thoughts, closeness drained power strength, kiss would destroy everything were.  I know now, Harry thought wand twitched once, twice, thrice four times, fingers slid exactly right distances, I comprehend nature, symbolize Death, law magic shadow Death casts world.  And Death something I ever embrace.  It childish thing, human species yet outgrown.  And someday...  We'll get it...  And people say goodbye more...  The wand rose leveled straight Dementor.  "EXPECTO PATRONUM!"  The thought exploded like breaking dam, surged arm wand, burst blazing white light. Light became corporeal, took shape substance.  A figure two arms, two legs, head, standing upright; animal Homo sapiens, shape human being.  Glowing brighter brighter Harry poured strength spell, blazing incandescent light brighter fading sunset, Aurors Professor Quirrell shielding eyes shock -  And someday descendants humanity spread star star, tell children history Ancient Earth they're old enough bear it; learn they'll weep hear thing Death ever existed!  The figure human shone brilliant noonday Sun, radiant Harry could feel warmth skin; Harry sent defiance shadow Death, opening floodgates inside make bright shape blaze even brighter yet brighter.  You invincible, someday human species end you.  I end I can, power mind magic science.  I cower fear Death, I chance winning.  I let Death touch me, I let Death touch ones I love.  And even end I end you,  Another take place, another,  Until wound world healed last...  Harry lowered wand, bright figure human faded away.  Slowly, exhaled.  Like waking dream, like opening eyes sleep, Harry's gaze moved away cage, looked around saw everyone staring him.  Albus Dumbledore staring him.  Professor Quirrell staring him.  The Auror trio staring him.  They looking like they'd seen destroy Dementor.  The tattered cloak lay empty within cage.   Chapter 46: Humanism, Pt 4  The last tip Sun sinking horizon, red light fading treetops, blue sky illuminating six people standing upon winter-dried snow-spotted grass, near vacant cage whose floor lay empty, tattered cloak.  Harry felt... well, normal again. Sane-ish. The spell undone day damage, made injuries never been, hurts been... bandaged, meliorated? It hard describe.  Dumbledore also looking healthier, though fully restored. The old wizard's head turned moment, locked eyes Professor Quirrell, looked back Harry. "Harry," Dumbledore said, "are collapse exhaustion possibly die?"  "No, strangely enough," Harry said. "That took something me, lot less I thought would." Or maybe gave something back, well taking... "Honestly, I expected body hitting ground thud now."  There distinct body-hitting-the-ground-with-a-thuddish sort sound.  "Thank taking care that, Quirinus," said Dumbledore Professor Quirrell, standing behind unconscious forms three Aurors. "I confess I still feeling bit peaky. Though I shall handle Memory Charms myself."  Professor Quirrell inclined head, looked Harry. "I omit good deal useless incredulity," said Professor Quirrell, "remarks effect Merlin failed that, et cetera. Let us go straight asking important question. What sweet slithering snakes that?"  "The Patronus Charm," Harry said. "Version 2.0."  "I rejoice see usual self again," said Dumbledore. "But going anywhere, young Ravenclaw, tell exactly warm happy thought."  "Hm..." said Harry. He tapped contemplative finger cheek. "I wonder I should?"  Professor Quirrell suddenly grinned.  "Please?" said Headmaster. "Pretty please sugar top?"  Harry felt impulse decided go it. It dangerous, might ever better opportunity end time.  "Three sodas," Harry said pouch, looked Defense Professor Headmaster Hogwarts. "Gentlemen," Harry said, "I bought sodas first visit Platform Nine Three-Quarters, day I entered Hogwarts. I saving special occasions; minor enchantment ensure drunk right time. This last supply, I think ever come finer occasion. Shall we?"  Dumbledore took soda Harry, Harry tossed another Professor Quirrell. The two older men muttered identical charms frowned briefly result. Harry, part, simply popped top drank.  The Defense Professor Headmaster Hogwarts politely followed suit.  Harry said, "I thought absolute rejection death natural order."  It might right kind warm feeling needed cast Patronus Charm, going Harry's Top 10 nonetheless.  The looks got Defense Professor Headmaster briefly made Harry nervous, spilled Comed-Tea faded existence; two glanced apparently decided get away anything really awful Harry other's presence.  "Mr. Potter," said Professor Quirrell, "even I know things supposed work."  "Indeed," said Dumbledore. "Explain."  Harry opened mouth, then, realization hit him, rapidly snapped mouth shut again. Godric told anyone, Rowena she'd known; might number wizards who'd figured kept mouths shut. You forget knew trying do; realized worked, animal form Patronus Charm would never work - wizards right upbringing turn Dementors destroy -  "Erm, sorry this," said Harry. "But I've instant realized explaining would incredibly bad idea work things own."  "Is truth, Harry?" Dumbledore said slowly. "Or pretending wise -"  "Headmaster!" said Professor Quirrell, sounding genuinely shocked. "Mr. Potter told spell spoken cannot cast it! You press wizard matters!"  "If I told -" Harry began.  "No," Professor Quirrell said, sounding rather severe. "You tell us why, Mr. Potter, simply tell us know. If wish devise hint, carefully, leisure, midst conversation."  Harry nodded.  "But," said Headmaster. "But, I tell Ministry? You can't lose Dementor!"  "Tell I ate it," said Professor Quirrell, causing Harry choke soda unthinkingly raised lips. "I mind. Shall head back, Mr. Potter?"  The two began walk dirt path back Hogwarts, leaving behind Albus Dumbledore staring forlornly empty cage three sleeping Aurors awaiting Memory Charms.   Aftermath, Harry Potter Professor Quirrell:  They walked Professor Quirrell spoke, background noise dropped silence did.  "You exceptionally good killing things, student," said Professor Quirrell.  "Thank you," Harry said sincerely.  "I prying," said Professor Quirrell, "but off-chance Headmaster trust secret...?"  Harry considered this. Professor Quirrell already cast animal Patronus Charm.  But untell secret, Harry fast enough learner realize ought least think unleashing one upon world.  Harry shook head, Professor Quirrell nodded acceptance.  "Out curiosity, Professor Quirrell," said Harry, "if bringing Dementor Hogwarts part evil plot, would goal?"  "Assassinate Dumbledore weakened," Professor Quirrell said without even hesitating. "Hm. The Headmaster told suspicious me?"  Harry said nothing second tried think reply, gave realized he'd already answered.  "Interesting..." Professor Quirrell said. "Mr. Potter, question plot work today. Your wand ending close Dementor's cage could accident. Or one Aurors could Imperiused, Confunded, Legilimized exert influence. Flitwick excluded suspects, calculation. One notes Professor Snape canceled classes today, I suspect powerful enough Disillusion himself; Aurors cast detection charms early on, repeat immediately turn. But easily all, Mr. Potter, deed could plotted Dumbledore himself; did, why, might also take steps advance cast suspicion elsewhere."  They walked steps.  "But would he?" Harry said.  The Defense Professor stayed quiet moment, said, "Mr. Potter, steps taken investigate Headmaster's character?"  "Not many," said Harry. He'd recently realized... "Not nearly enough."  "Then I observe," said Professor Quirrell, "that find know man asking friends."  Now Harry's turn walk steps silence slightly beaten dirt path led back Hogwarts. He'd really supposed know better already. Confirmation bias technical term; meant, among things, chose information sources, notable tendency choose information sources agreed current opinions.  "Thank you," Harry said. "Actually... I say earlier, I? Thank everything. If another Dementor ever threatens you, matter, slightly annoys you, let know I'll introduce Mister Glowy Person. I like Dementors slightly annoy friends."  That got indecipherable glance Professor Quirrell. "You destroyed Dementor threatened me?"  "Erm," Harry said, "I'd sort decided then, yes, would sufficient reason itself."  "I see," said Professor Quirrell. "And would done threat spell worked destroying Dementor?"  "Plan B," said Harry. "Encase Dementor dense metal high melting point, probably tungsten, drop active volcano, hope ends inside Earth's mantle. Ah, whole planet filled molten lava surface -"  "Yes," said Professor Quirrell. "I know." The Defense Professor wearing odd smile. "I really thought myself, things considered. Tell me, Mr. Potter, wanted lose something one would ever find again, would put it?"  Harry considered question. "I suppose I ask found needs losing -"  "Quite," said Professor Quirrell, Harry expected; then, "Perhaps told older," Harry hadn't.  "Well," said Harry, "besides trying get molten core planet, could bury solid rock kilometer underground randomly selected location - maybe teleport in, there's way blindly, drill hole repair hole afterward; important thing would leave traces leading there, anonymous cubic meter somewhere Earth's crust. You could drop Mariana Trench, that's deepest depth ocean planet - pick random ocean trench, make less obvious. If could make buoyant invisible, could throw stratosphere. Or ideally would launch space, cloak detection, randomly fluctuating acceleration factor would take Solar System. And afterward, course, Obliviate yourself, even know exactly was."  The Defense Professor laughing, sounded even odder smile.  "Professor Quirrell?" Harry said.  "All excellent suggestions," said Professor Quirrell. "But tell me, Mr. Potter, exact five?"  "Huh?" said Harry. "They seemed like obvious sorts ideas."  "Oh?" said Professor Quirrell. "But interesting pattern them, see. One might say sounds like something riddle. I must admit, Mr. Potter, although ups downs, whole, surprisingly good day."  And continued walking path led gates Hogwarts, quite distance apart; Harry, without even thinking it, automatically stayed far enough away Defense Professor trigger sense doom, reason seemed unusually strong right now.   Aftermath, Daphne Greengrass:  Hermione refused answer questions, soon they'd passed split leading Slytherin dungeons, Daphne Tracey peeled once, walking quickly could. Rumor traveled fast Hogwarts, they'd go dungeons right away wanted first tell everyone story.  "Now remember," said Daphne, "don't blurt kiss soon walk in, okay? It works better tell whole story order."  Tracey nodded excitedly.  And soon burst Slytherin common room, Tracey Davis took deep breath shouted, "Everyone! Harry Potter cast Patronus Charm Dementor almost ate Professor Quirrell saved Potter evil Granger brought back kiss! It's true love sure!"  It ordered storytelling sort, Daphne supposed.  The news failed produce expected reaction. Most girls glanced stayed couches, boys simply kept reading chairs.  "Yes," said Pansy sourly, sitting Gregory's feet lap, leaning back reading seemed coloring book, "Millicent already told us."  How -  "Why kiss first, Tracey?" said Flora Hestia Carrow chairs. "Now Potter's going marry mudblood girl! You could've true love gotten rich Noble House everything kissed first!"  Tracey's face picture stunned realization.  "What?" shrieked Daphne. "Love work like that!"  "Of course does," stated Millicent practicing sort Charm looking window swirling waters Hogwarts Lake. "First kiss gets prince."  "It first kiss!" shouted Daphne. "Hermione already true love! That's could bring back!" Then Daphne realized she'd said winced internally, saying went, fit tongue ear.  "Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?" said Gregory, swinging feet Pansy's lap. "What's this? Miss Bulstrode tell part."  Everyone else also looking Daphne, now.  "Oh, yeah," said Daphne, "Harry shoved away shouted, 'I told you, kissing!' Then Harry screamed like dying Fawkes started singing - I'm sure one happened first, actually -"  "That sound like true love me," said Carrow twins. "That sounds like wrong person kissed him."  "It supposed me," whispered Tracey. Her face still stunned. "I supposed true love. Harry Potter general. I should've, I fought Granger -"  Daphne spun Tracey, incensed. "You? Take Harry away Hermione?"  "Yeah!" said Tracey. "Me!"  "You're nuts," Daphne stated conviction. "Even kissed first, know would make you? The sad little lovestruck girl dies end Act Two."  "You take back!" shouted Tracey.  Meanwhile, Gregory crossed room Vincent homework. "Mr. Crabbe," Gregory said low voice, "I think Mr. Malfoy needs know this."   Aftermath, Hermione Granger:  Hermione stared wax-sealed paper, surface inscribed simply number 42.  I figured cast Patronus Charm, Hermione, anything us happy enough. But I can't tell you. I even tell Headmaster. It needs even secret partial Transfiguration, now, anyway. But ever need fight Dementors, secret written here, cryptically, someone know Dementors Patronus Charm, know means...  She'd told Harry seeing dying, parents dying, friends dying, everyone dying. She told terror dying alone, somehow still painful.  Harry told remembering parents dying, he'd thought funny.  There's light place Dementor takes you, Hermione. No warmth. No caring. It's somewhere can't even understand happiness. There's pain, fear, still drive you. You hate, take pleasure destroying hate. You laugh, see people hurting. But can't ever happy, can't even remember anymore... I think there's way I ever explain saved from. I'm usually ashamed put people trouble, I usually can't stand people make sacrifices me, one time I'll say matter ends costing kissed me, ever doubt second right thing do.  Hermione realized little Dementor touched her, small shallow darkness taken her.  She'd seen everyone dying, still able hurt.  Hermione put paper back pouch, like good girl ought to.  She'd really wanted read it, though.  She frightened Dementors.   Aftermath, Minerva McGonagall:  She felt frozen; shocked, found Harry hard face, he'd through... She searched young boy front signs Dementation, failed find them. But something calm asked foreboding question seemed deeply worrying. "Mr. Potter, I can't possibly speak matters without Headmaster's permission!"  The boy office took without changing expression. "I would prefer disturb Headmaster matter," Harry Potter said calmly. "I insist disturbing him, fact, promise conversation would kept private. So let put way. I know was, fact, prophecy. I know one originally heard Professor Trelawney. I know prophecy identified child James Lily someone dangerous Dark Lord. And I know I am, indeed everyone knows I am, revealing nothing new dangerous, tell this: What exact wording identified me, child James Lily?"  Trelawney's hollow voice echoed mind -  BORN TO THOSE WHO HAVE THRICE DEFIED HIM,   BORN AS THE SEVENTH MONTH DIES...  "Harry," said Professor McGonagall, "I can't possibly tell that!" It chilled bone Harry knew much already, imagine Harry learned -  The boy looked strange, sorrowful eyes. "Can sneeze without Headmaster's permission, Professor McGonagall? For I promise I good reason ask, good reason keep question private."  "Please don't, Harry," whispered.  "All right," Harry said. "One simple question. Please. Was Potter family mentioned name? Does prophecy literally say 'Potter'?"  She stared Harry while. She said got sense critical point, could lightly refuse request, lightly accede -  "No," finally said. "Please, Harry, ask more."  The boy smiled, little sadly seemed, said, "Thank you, Minerva. You good woman true."  And mouth still open utter shock, Harry Potter got left office; realize Harry taken refusal answer, true answer -  Harry closed door behind himself.  The logic presented strange diamondlike clarity. Harry said come Fawkes's singing, maybe even before.  Lord Voldemort killed James Potter. He preferred spare Lily Potter's life. He continued attack, therefore, sole purpose killing infant child.  Dark Lords usually scared infant children.  So prophecy Harry Potter dangerous Lord Voldemort, Lord Voldemort known prophecy.  "I give rare chance flee. But I trouble subdue you, death save child. Step aside, foolish woman, sense all!"  Had whim, give chance? But Lord Voldemort would tried persuade her. Had prophecy warned Lord Voldemort killing Lily Potter? Then Lord Voldemort would troubled subdue her. Lord Voldemort mildly inclined kill Lily Potter. The preference stronger whim, strong warning.  So suppose someone Lord Voldemort considered lesser ally servant, useful indispensable, begged Dark Lord spare Lily's life. Lily's, James's.  This person known Lord Voldemort would attack house Potters. Had known prophecy, fact Dark Lord knew it. Otherwise would begged Lily's life.  According Professor McGonagall, besides herself, two knew prophecy Albus Dumbledore Severus Snape.  Severus Snape, loved Lily Lily Potter, hated James.  Severus, then, learned prophecy, told Dark Lord. Which done prophecy described Potters name. It riddle, Severus solved riddle late.  But Severus first hear prophecy, disposed tell Dark Lord, would also told Dumbledore Professor McGonagall?  Therefore Dumbledore Professor McGonagall heard first.  The Headmaster Hogwarts obvious reason tell Transfiguration Professor extremely sensitive crucial prophecy. But Transfiguration Professor every reason tell Headmaster.  It seemed likely, then, Professor McGonagall first hear it.  The prior probabilities said Professor Trelawney, Hogwarts's resident seer. Seers rare, counted seconds Professor McGonagall spent presence seer course lifetime, seer-seconds would Trelawney-seconds.  Professor McGonagall told Dumbledore, would told one else prophecy without permission.  Therefore, Albus Dumbledore arranged Severus Snape somehow learn prophecy. And Dumbledore solved riddle successfully, would selected Severus, loved Lily, intermediary.  Dumbledore deliberately arranged Lord Voldemort hear prophecy, hopes luring death. Perhaps Dumbledore arranged Severus learn prophecy, prophecies Severus remained innocent... somehow Dumbledore known immediate attack Potters would still lead Lord Voldemort's immediate defeat, although Lord Voldemort believed this. Or maybe lucky stroke Dumbledore's insanity, taste bizarre plots...  Severus ended serving Dumbledore afterward; perhaps Death Eaters would look kindly Severus Dumbledore revealed role defeat.  Dumbledore tried arrange Harry's mother spared. But part plot failed. And knowingly condemned James Potter death.  Dumbledore responsible deaths Harry's parents. If whole chain logic correct. Harry could not, justice, say successfully ending Wizarding War count extenuating circumstances. But somehow still... bothered great deal.  And time past time ask Draco Malfoy side war say character Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore.   Chapter 47: Personhood Theory  There comes point every plot victim starts suspect; looks back, sees trail events pointing single direction. And point comes, Father explained, prospect loss may seem unbearable, admitting tricked may seem humiliating, victim yet deny plot, game may continue long after.  Father warned Draco again.  First, though, he'd let Mr. Avery finish eating cookies he'd swindled Draco, Draco watched cried. The whole lovely jar cookies Father given hours earlier, Draco lost Mr. Avery, last one.  So familiar feeling Draco felt pit stomach, Gregory told The Kiss.  Sometimes looked back, saw things...  (In lightless classroom - quite call unused more, since it'd seen weekly use last months - boy sat enshrouded hooded cowl, unlighted crystal globe desk front him. Thinking silence, thinking darkness, waiting opening door let light.)  Harry shoved Granger away said, I told you, kissing!  Harry would probably say something like, She annoy me, last time, like made go date.  But verified story Granger willing face Dementor order help Harry; kissed Harry, crying, lost depths Dementation; kiss brought back.  That sound like rivalry, even friendly rivalry.  That sounded like kind friendship usually see even plays.  Then Harry made friend climb icy walls Hogwarts?  Because sort thing Harry Potter friends?  Father told Draco fathom strange plot, one technique look ended happening, assume intended result, ask benefited.  What ended happening result Draco Granger fighting Harry Potter together... Draco started feel lot friendlier toward Granger.  Who benefited scion Malfoy becoming friends mudblood witch?  Who benefited, famous exactly sort plot?  Who benefited, could possibly pulling Harry Potter's strings?  Dumbledore.  And true Draco would go Father tell everything, matter happened that, Draco imagine would happen that, awful beyond imagining. Which made want cling desperately last shred hope looked like...  ...Draco remembered that, too, Mr. Avery's lesson.  Draco planned confront Harry yet. He still trying think experimental test, something Harry see fake. But Vincent come message Harry wanted meet early week, Friday instead Saturday.  And Draco was, dark classroom, unlit crystal globe desk, waiting.  Minutes passed.  Footsteps approached.  The door made gentle creak swung open classroom, revealing Harry Potter dressed hood cowl; Harry stepped forward dark classroom, sturdy door closed behind faint click.  Draco tapped crystal globe, classroom lit bright green light. Green light projected shadows desks onto floor, glared back curved chair-backs, photons bouncing wood fashion angle incidence equaled angle reflection.  At least much he'd learned likely lie.  Harry flinched light went on, halting moment, resumed approach. "Hello, Draco," Harry said quietly, drawing back hood came Draco's desk. "Thank coming, I know usual time -"  "You're welcome," Draco said flatly.  Harry dragged one chairs face Draco across desk, legs making slight screeching sound floor. He spun chair facing wrong way, sat straddling it, arms folded across back chair. The boy's face pensive, frowning, serious, looking adult even Harry Potter.  "I important question ask you," said Harry, "but there's something else I want us that."  Draco said nothing, feeling certain weariness. Part wanted already.  "Tell me, Draco," said Harry. "Why Muggles ever leave ghosts behind die?"  "Because Muggles souls, obviously," Draco said. He even realize he'd said might contradict Harry's politics, care. Besides, obvious.  Harry's face showed surprise. "Before I ask important question, I want see learn Patronus Charm."  For moment sheer nonsequitur stumped Draco. Good old impossible-to-predict-or-understand Harry Potter. There times Draco wondered whether Harry deliberately disorienting tactic.  Then Draco understood, shoved away desk single angry motion. That it. It over. "Like Dumbledore's servants," spat.  "Like Salazar Slytherin," Harry said steadily.  Draco almost stumbled feet middle first stride toward door.  Slowly, Draco turned back toward Harry.  "I know came that," said Draco, "but wrong, everyone knows Patronus Charm Gryffindor spell -"  "Salazar Slytherin could cast corporeal Patronus Charm," Harry said. Harry's hand darted robes, brought book whose title written white green, almost impossible read green light; looked old. "I discovered I researching Patronus Charm before. And I found original reference checked book library case believe me. The author book think there's anything unusual Salazar able cast Patronus, either; belief Slytherins can't must recent. And historical note, though I book me, Godric Gryffindor never could."  After first six times Draco tried calling Harry's bluff, six successively ridiculous occasions, he'd realized Harry lie written books. Still, Harry's hands opened book laid place bookmark, Draco leaned studied place Harry's finger pointed.  Then fires Ravenclaw fell upon darkness cloaked left wing Lord Foul's army, breaking it, revealed Lord Gryffindor spoken true; fear felt natural source, coming thrice dozen Dementors, promised souls defeated. At Lady Hufflepuff Lord Slytherin brought forth Patronuses, vast angry badger bright silver serpent, defenders lifted heads shadow passed hearts. And Lady Ravenclaw laughed, remarking Lord Foul great fool, army would subject fear, defenders Hogwarts. Yet Lord Slytherin said, "No fool he, much I know." And Lord Gryffindor beside studied battlefield frown upon face...  Draco looked back up. "So?"  Harry closed book put pouch. "Chaos Sunshine soldiers cast corporeal Patronus Charms. Corporeal Patronuses used convey messages. If can't learn spell, Dragon Army severe military disadvantage -"  Draco care right now, told Harry so. His voice sharper probably been.  Harry blink. "Then I'm calling favor owe time I stopped riot breaking out, first day broomstick lessons. I'm going try teach Patronus Charm, favor, I want honest best learn cast it. I trust honor House Malfoy will."  Draco felt certain weariness again. If Harry asked time, would fair return favor owed, given actually Gryffindor spell. But...  "Why?" Draco said.  "To find whether thing Salazar Slytherin could do," Harry said evenly. "This experimental test, I tell means done it. Will you?"  ...It probably good idea discharge favor something innocuous, time break Harry Potter. "All right."  Harry drew wand robes, laid globe. "Not really best color learning Patronus Charm," Harry said. "Green light exact shade Killing Curse, I mean. But silver Slytherin color too, it? Dulak." The light went out, Harry whispered first two phrases Continual Light enchantment, recasting part it, though neither could cast whole thing themselves. Then Harry tapped globe again, room lit silver radiance, brilliant still soft gentle. Color returned desks chairs, Harry's slightly sweaty face beneath shock black hair.  It took long Draco realize implication. "You saw Killing Curse cast since last time met? When - -"  "Cast Patronus Charm," Harry said, looking serious ever, "and I'll tell you."  Draco pressed hands eyes, shutting silver light. "You know, I really remember weird normal plots!"  Within self-imposed darkness, heard sound Harry snickering.   Harry watched closely Draco finished latest run-through preliminary gestures, part spell difficult learn; final brandish pronunciation precise. All three last runs perfect far Harry could see. Harry also felt odd impulse adjust things Mr. Lupin said anything about, like angle Draco's elbow direction foot pointing; could entirely imagination, probably was, Harry decided go case.  "All right," Harry said quietly. There tension chest made little hard speak. "Now Dementor here, that's right. We need one. Draco, father spoke train station, said one thing world precious him, threatened throw away plans take vengeance me, ever came harm."  "He... what?" There catch Draco's voice, strange look face. "Why telling that?"  "Why I?" Harry let expression change, though could guess Draco thinking; Harry plotting separate Draco father, saying anything would bring closer together. "There's always one person matters you, I know exactly warm happy thought let cast Patronus Charm. You told train station first day school. Once fell broomstick broke ribs. It hurt anything ever felt, thought going die. Pretend fear coming Dementor, standing front you, wearing tattered black cloak, looking like dead thing left water. And cast Patronus Charm, brandish wand drive Dementor away, think father held hand, afraid; think much loves you, much love him, put voice say Expecto Patronum. For honor House Malfoy, promised favor. Show lie day train station told Lucius good father. Show Salazar Slytherin could do."  And Harry stepped backward, behind Draco, Draco's field vision, Draco faced dusty old teacher's desk blackboard front unused classroom.  Draco cast one look behind him, strange look still face, turned away face forward. Harry saw exhalation, inhalation. The wand twitched once, twice, thrice, four times. Draco's fingers slid along wand, exactly right distances -  Draco lowered wand.  "This -" Draco said, "I can't think right, watching -"  Harry turned around started walking toward door. "I'll come back minute," Harry said. "Just hold happy thought, Patronus stay."   From behind Draco came sound door opening again.  Draco heard Harry's footsteps entering classroom, Draco turn look.  Harry say anything either. The silence stretched.  Finally -  "What mean?" Draco said. His voice wavered bit.  "It means love father," Harry's voice said. Which Draco thinking, trying cry front Harry. It right, right -  Before Draco, floor, shining form snake Draco recognized; Blue Krait, snake first brought manor Lord Abraxas Malfoy visit faraway land, Father kept Blue Krait ophidiarium ever since. The thing Blue Krait bite hurt much. Father said that, told Draco never allowed pet snake, matter watching. The venom killed nerves fast time feel pain poison spread. You could die even using Healing Charms. It ate snakes. It Slytherin creature could possibly be.  That Blue Krait head forged handle Father's cane.  The bright snake darted tongue, also silver; seemed smile somehow, warmer way reptile should.  And Draco realized -  "But," Draco said, still staring beautifully radiant snake, "you can't cast Patronus Charm." Now Draco cast himself, understood important. You could evil, like Dumbledore, still cast Patronus Charm, long something bright left inside you. But Harry Potter single thought inside shone like -  "The Patronus Charm complicated think, Draco," Harry said seriously. "Not everyone fails casting bad person, even unhappy. But anyway, I cast it. I second try, I realized I'd done wrong facing Dementor first time. But, well, life gets little peculiar sometimes, Patronus came strange, I'm keeping secret -"  "Am I supposed believe that?"  "You ask Professor Quirrell believe me," said Harry. "Ask whether Harry Potter cast corporeal Patronus, tell I told ask. He'd know request me, one else would know."  Oh, Draco trust Professor Quirrell? Still, knowing Harry, might true; Professor Quirrell lie trivial reasons.  The glowing snake turned head back forth, though seeking prey there, coiled circle, though rest.  "I wonder," Harry said softly, "when was, year, generation, Slytherins stopped trying learn Patronus Charm. When people started think, Slytherins started think, cunning ambitious cold unhappy. And Salazar knew students even bother showing learn Patronus Charm more, I wonder, would wish he'd never born? I wonder went wrong, Slytherin's House went wrong."  The shining creature winked out, turmoil rising Draco making impossible sustain Charm. Draco spun Harry, control raise wand. "What know Slytherin House Salazar Slytherin? You never Sorted House, gives right -"  And Draco finally realized.  "You get Sorted Slytherin!" Draco said. "You did, afterwards you, somehow, snapped fingers -" Draco asked Father would cleverer get Sorted House everyone would trust him, Father smiled said he'd thought Draco's age, way fool Sorting Hat...  ...not Harry Potter came along.  How ever bought one minute Harry Ravenclaw?  "An interesting hypothesis," Harry said equably. "Do know, second person Hogwarts come theory along lines? At least second that's actually said face -"  "Snape," Draco said certainty. His Head House fool.  "Professor Quirrell, course," said Harry. "Though come think, Severus ask I managed stay House, whether I something Sorting Hat wanted. I suppose could say number three. Oh, Professor Quirrell's theory little different yours, though. May I word repeat it?"  Draco nodded without even really thinking it. What supposed do, say no?  "Professor Quirrell thought Dumbledore happy Hat's choice Boy-Who-Lived."  And instant Harry said it, Draco knew, knew true, obvious. Who Dumbledore even think fooling?  ...well, besides every single person Hogwarts except Snape Quirrell, Harry might even believe himself...  Draco stumbled back desk something daze, sat hard enough hurt slightly. This sort thing happened around month Harry, happened yet January, time.  His fellow Slytherin, might might think Ravenclaw, sat back chair he'd used earlier, sitting crosswise, looking intently Draco.  Draco know now, whether trying persuade lost Slytherin boy that, no, actually Ravenclaw... trying figure whether Harry league Dumbledore, though suddenly seemed less likely... Harry set whole thing Granger...  He really remembered Harry weird normal plots.  "Harry," Draco said. "Did deliberately antagonize General Sunshine we'd work together you?"  Harry nodded without hesitation, though normal thing world, nothing ashamed of.  "The whole thing gloves making us climb walls Hogwarts, point make Granger friendly toward other. And even then. You've plotting really long time. Since beginning."  Again nod.  "WHYYYYY?"  Harry's eyebrows lifted moment, reaction showed Draco shrieking loudly closed classroom hurt ears. WHY, WHY, WHY Harry Potter DO sort thing...  Then Harry said, "So Slytherins able cast Patronus Charm again."  "That... doesn't... make... SENSE!" Draco aware losing control voice, seem able stop himself. "What Granger?"  "Patterns," Harry said. His face serious now, grave. "Like quarter children born Squib couples wizards. A simple, unmistakable pattern would recognize instantly, knew looking at; even though, know, even realize clue. The poison Slytherin House something that's seen Muggle world. This advance prediction, Draco, I could written first day school, hearing talk King's Cross Station. Let describe really pathetic sorts people hang around father's political rallies, pureblood families would never invited dinner Malfoy Manor. Bearing mind I've never met them, I'm predicting recognizing pattern what's happening Slytherin House -"  And Harry Potter proceeded describe Parkinsons Montagues Boles calmly cutting accuracy Draco dared think case Legilimens around, beyond insult, would kill Harry ever heard...  "To sum up," Harry finished, "they power themselves. They wealth themselves. If Muggleborns hate, Muggleborns vanished way say want, they'd wake one morning find nothing. But long say purebloods superior, feel superior themselves, feel like part master class. Even though father would never dream inviting dinner, even though there's one Galleon vaults, even worse OWLs worst Muggleborn Hogwarts. Even can't cast Patronus Charm more. Everything Muggleborns' fault them, someone besides blame failures, makes even weaker. That's Slytherin House becoming, pathetic, root problem hating Muggleborns."  "Salazar Slytherin said mudbloods needed cast out! That weakening blood -" Draco's voice risen shout.  "Salazar wrong question simple fact! You know that, Draco! And hatred poisoning whole House, cast Patronus Charm using thought like that!"  "Then could Salazar Slytherin cast Patronus Charm?"  Harry wiping sweat forehead. "Because things changed now! Listen, Draco, three hundred years ago could find great scientists, great Salazar way, would told Muggles inferior skin color -"  "Skin color?" said Draco.  "I know, skin color instead anything important like blood purity, ridiculous? But something world changed, can't find great scientists still think skin color matter, loser people like ones I described you. Salazar Slytherin made mistake everyone else making it, grew believing it, desperate someone hate. There people better everyone else around them, exceptionally good. But ones accepted everyone else thought exceptionally evil. The sad fact people notice moral issue unless someone else pointing them; they're old Salazar met Godric, they've lost ability change minds. Only Hogwarts built, Hogwarts started sending acceptance letters Muggleborns like Godric insisted, more people began notice Muggleborns different. Now big political issue instead something everyone believes without thinking it. And correct answer Muggleborns weaker purebloods. So people end siding Salazar believed, either people grew closed pureblood environments like you, people pathetic they're desperate someone feel superior to, people love hate."  "That doesn't... sound right..." Draco's voice said. His ears listened, wondered come anything better say.  "It doesn't? Draco, know there's nothing wrong Hermione Granger. You trouble dropping roof, I hear. Even though knew she'd taken Feather-Falling Potion, even though knew safe. What sort person think wants kill her, wrong them, Muggleborn? Even though she's, young girl would help homework second, ever asked her," Harry's voice broke, "what sort person wants die?"  Father -  Draco felt split two, seemed problem dual vision, Granger mudblood, die girl hanging hand rooftop, like seeing double, seeing double -  "And anyone want Hermione Granger die, want hang around sort people do! That's people think Slytherin now, clever planning, trying achieve greatness, hating Muggleborns! I paid Morag Sickle ask Padma gone Slytherin, know got option. And Morag told Padma gave look said Pansy Parkinson. You see? The best students virtues one House, students choices, go Hat thinking anywhere Slytherin, someone like Padma ends Ravenclaw. And... I think Sorting Hat tries maintain balance Sorting, fills ranks Slytherin anyone repelled hatred. So instead Padma Patil, Slytherin gets Pansy Parkinson. She's cunning, ambitious, sort person mind Slytherin turning into. And Padmas go Ravenclaw Pansies go Slytherin, process accelerates. It's destroying Slytherin House, Draco!"  It ring awful truth, Padma belonged Slytherin... instead Slytherin got Pansy... Father rallied lesser families like Parkinsons convenient sources support, Father realized consequences associating Slytherin's name them...  "I can't -" Draco said, even sure - "What want me?"  "I'm sure heal Slytherin House," Harry said slowly. "But I know something I end do. It took centuries science dawn Muggle world, happened slowly, stronger science got, sort hatred retreated." Harry's voice quiet, now. "I know exactly worked way, that's happened historically. As though there's something science like shine Patronus Charm, driving back sorts darkness madness, right away, seems follow wherever science goes. The Enlightenment, was called Muggle world. It something seeking truth, I think... able change mind grew believing... thinking logically, realizing there's reason hate someone skin different color, like there's reason hate Hermione Granger... maybe there's something even I understand. But Enlightenment something I belong now, us. Fixing Slytherin House one things do."  "Let think," Draco said, voice coming something croak, "please," rested head hands, thought.   Draco thought while, palms eyes shut world, sound Harry's breathing. All persuasive reasonableness Harry said, evident grains truth contained; that, obvious, perfectly entirely obvious hypothesis really going on...  After time, Draco finally raised head.  "It sounds right," Draco said quietly.  A huge smile broke Harry's face.  "So," Draco continued, "is bring Dumbledore, make official?"  He kept voice casual said it.  "Oh, yeah," Harry said. "That thing I going ask about, actually -"  Draco's blood froze veins, froze solid shattered -  "Professor Quirrell said something got thinking, and, well, matter answer question, I'm already stupid asked lot earlier. Everyone Gryffindor thinks Dumbledore saint, Hufflepuffs think he's crazy, Ravenclaws proud worked he's pretending crazy, I never asked anyone Slytherin. I'm supposed know better make sort mistake. But even think Dumbledore's okay conspire fixing Slytherin House, I guess I miss anything important."  ...  ...  ...  "You know," Draco said, voice remarkably calm, things considered, "every time I wonder things like annoy me, I tell accidental, one could possibly sort thing purpose even tried blood trickled ears. That's reason I'm going strangle now."  "Huh?"  And strangle himself, Harry grown Muggles, Dumbledore smoothly diverted Slytherin Ravenclaw, perfectly plausible Harry might know anything, Draco never thought tell him.  Or else Harry guessed Draco join Dumbledore readily, next step Dumbledore's plan...  But Harry really know Dumbledore, warning take precedence everything.  "All right," Draco said, he'd chance organize thoughts. "I know start, I'll start somewhere." Draco drew deep breath. This going take while. "Dumbledore murdered little sister, got away brother testify -"   Harry listened increasing worry dismay. Harry prepared, he'd thought, take blood purist side story grain salt. The trouble even added enormous amount salt, still sound good.  Dumbledore's father convicted using Unforgivable Curses children, died Azkaban. That sin Dumbledore's, would matter public record. Harry could check part, see whether made thin air blood purists.  Dumbledore's mother died mysteriously, shortly younger sister died Aurors ruled murder. Supposedly sister brutalized Muggles never spoken that; which, Draco pointed out, sounded remarkably like botched Obliviation.  After Harry's first interruptions, Draco seemed pick general principle, presenting observations first inferences afterward.  "- take word it," said Draco, "you see it, right? Anyone Slytherin can. Dumbledore waited fight duel Grindelwald exact moment would look best Dumbledore, Grindelwald ruined Europe built reputation terrible Dark Wizard history, Grindelwald lost gold blood sacrifices getting Muggle pawns start heading downhill. If Dumbledore really noble wizard pretended be, he'd fought Grindelwald long that. Dumbledore probably wanted Europe ruined, probably part plan together, attacked Grindelwald puppet failed him. And big flashy duel real, there's way two wizards would exactly matched they'd fight twenty whole hours one fell exhaustion, Dumbledore making look spectacular." Here Draco's voice became indignant. "And got Dumbledore made Chief Warlock Wizengamot! The Line Merlin Unbroken, corrupted fifteen hundred years! And became Supreme Mugwump top that, already Hogwarts use invincible fortress - Headmaster Chief Warlock Supreme Mugwump, normal person would try once, anyone see Dumbledore's trying take world?"  "Pause," Harry said, closed eyes think.  It worse would heard West Stalin's Russia, none would true. Though blood purists able get away making stuff entirely... would they? The Daily Prophet shown pronounced tendency make stuff up... again, stuck neck far Weasley betrothal, called embarrassed...  Harry opened eyes, saw Draco watching steady, waiting gaze.  "So asked time join Dumbledore, test."  Draco nodded.  "And that, said sounded right -"  "It sounds right," said Draco. "But I know I trust you. Are going complain testing you, Mr. Potter? Are going say I fooled you? That I led on?"  Harry knew smile like good sport, really, much disappointment.  "You're right, fair, I can't complain," Harry said instead. "So He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named? Not bad made be?"  Draco looked bitter, that. "So think making Father's side look good Dumbledore's side look bad, I believe Father told me."  "It's possibility I'm considering," Harry said evenly.  Draco's voice low intense. "They knew. My father knew, friends knew. They knew Dark Lord evil. But chance anyone Dumbledore! The wizard anywhere powerful enough fight him! Some Death Eaters truly evil too, like Bellatrix Black - Father like - Father friends it, Harry, to, Dumbledore taking everything, Dark Lord hope anyone left!"  Draco staring hard Harry. Harry met gaze, trying think. Nobody ever thought villain story - maybe Lord Voldemort did, maybe Bellatrix did, Draco certainly didn't. That Death Eaters bad guys question. The question whether bad guys; whether one villain story, two...  "You're convinced," Draco said. He looked worried, little angry. Which surprise Harry. He pretty sure Draco believed this.  "Should I convinced?" Harry said. He look away. "Just believe it? Are strong enough rationalist belief strong evidence me, unlikely believe true? When I met you, strong. Everything told me, rethink awakened scientist, something grew believing? Can look eyes swear upon honor House Malfoy there's one untruth buried said, one thing got added make Dumbledore look little worse, would noticed?"  Draco started open mouth, Harry said, "Don't. Don't stain honor House Malfoy. You're strong yet, know it. Listen, Draco, I've started notice worrying things myself. But there's nothing definite, nothing certain, deductions hypotheses untrustworthy witnesses... And there's nothing certain story, either. Dumbledore might've good reason fight Grindelwald years earlier - though would pretty good excuse, especially considering happening Muggle side things... still. Is one clearly evil thing Dumbledore's done certain, I wonder?"  Draco's breathing harsh. "All right," Draco said uneven voice, "I'll tell Dumbledore did." From Draco's robes came wand, Draco said "Quietus", "Quietus" again, got pronunciation wrong second time, finally Harry took wand it.  "There," said Draco hoarsely, "once upon time there, girl, name Narcissa, prettiest, smartest, cunning girl ever Sorted Slytherin, father loved her, married, Death Eater, fighter, ever love Father -" Draco stopped there, crying.  Harry felt sick stomach. Draco never talked mother, once, noticed earlier. "She... got way curse?"  Draco's voice came scream. "Dumbledore burned death bedroom!"   In classroom filled soft silver light, one boy staring another boy, sobbing, wiping frantically eyes sleeves robes.  It hard Harry stay balanced, keep withholding judgment, emotional, something either wanted start tears eyes sympathy Draco, know true...  Dumbledore burned death bedroom!  That...  ...didn't sound like Dumbledore's style...  ...but could think thought many times, started wonder trustworthiness whole 'style' concept.  "It, must hurt horribly," Draco said, voice shaking, "Father never talks all, ever talk front him, Mr. Macnair told me, scorch marks bedroom, Mother must struggled Dumbledore burned alive. That debt Dumbledore owes House Malfoy life it!"  "Draco," Harry said, let hoarseness voice, would wrong sound calm, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry asking, I know, know Dumble-"  "Dumbledore said it, told Father warning! And Father testify Veritaserum Occlumens, even get Dumbledore put trial, Father's allies believe Dumbledore denied everything public, know, Death Eaters know, Father reason lie that, Father would want us take revenge right person, can't see Harry?" Draco's voice wild.  Unless Lucius himself, course, found convenient blame Dumbledore.  Although... also seem like Lucius's style. And murdered Narcissa, would smarter pin blame easier victim instead losing political capital credibility going Dumbledore...  In time, Draco stopped crying, looked Harry. "Well?" said Draco, sounding like wanted spit words. "Is evil enough you, Mr. Potter?"  Harry looked arms rested back chair. He meet Draco's eyes more, pain raw. "I expecting hear that," Harry said softly. "I know think more."  "You know?" Draco's voice rose shriek, stood abruptly desk -  "I remembered Dark Lord killing parents," Harry said. "When I went front Dementor first time, I remembered, worst memory. Even though long ago. I heard dying. My mother begged Dark Lord kill me, Harry, please no, take me, kill instead! That's said. And Dark Lord mocked her, laughed. Then, I remember, flash green light -"  Harry looked Draco.  "So could fight," Harry said, "we could keep fight. You could tell right mother die, wife James, killed Death Eater. But bad mother die, innocent. And I could tell right mother die, Dumbledore must reason made okay burn alive bedroom; bad mother die. But know, Draco, either way, obvious biased? Because rule says wrong kill innocent people, rule can't switch mother yours, can't switch mother mine. If tell Lily enemy Death Eaters right kill enemies, rule says Dumbledore right kill Narcissa, since enemy." Harry's voice went hoarse. "So two us going agree anything, going neither deaths right one's mother die more."   The fury boiling inside Draco great could barely stop storming room; halted recognition critical moment; small remnant friendship, tiny flash sympathy, forgotten, he'd forgotten, Harry's mother father dead Dark Lord's hand.  The silence stretched.  "You talk," Harry said, "Draco, talk me, I get angry - thinking, I know, Narcissa dying much worse Lily dying? That wrong even make comparison?"  "I guess I stupid too," Draco said. "All time, time I forgot must hate Death Eaters killing parents, hate Death Eaters way I hate Dumbledore." And Harry never said anything, never reacted Draco talked Death Eaters, kept hidden - Draco fool.  "No," Harry said. "It's - like that, Draco, I, I even know explain you, except say thought like that, wouldn't," Harry's voice choked, "you ever able use it, cast Patronus Charm..."  Draco felt sudden wrench heart, unwanted felt it. "Are pretending going forget parents? Are saying I forget Mother?"  "So I enemies then?" Now Harry's voice growing equally wild. "What ever done means enemies? I refuse trapped like that! Justice can't mean us attack other, make sense!" Harry stopped, took deep breath, ran fingers back deliberate mess hair - fingers came away sweaty, Draco could see it. "Draco, listen, can't expect meet everything right away, I. So I ask say Dark Lord wrong kill mother, say was... sad. We talk whether necessary, whether justified. I'll ask say sad happened, mother's life valuable too, say now. And I'll say sad Narcissa died, life also worth something. We can't expect agree everything right away, start saying every life precious, sad anyone dies, I know we'll meet someday. That's I want say. Not right. Not wrong. Just sad mother died, sad mother died, would sad Hermione Granger died, every life precious, agree let rest go now, enough agree that? Can we, Draco? That seems... like thought someone could use cast Patronus Charm."  There tears Harry's eyes.  And Draco getting angry again. "Dumbledore killed Mother, enough say sad! I understand think do, Malfoys take revenge!" Not avenging deaths family went beyond weakness, beyond dishonor, might well exist.  "I'm arguing that," Harry said quietly. "But say Lily Potter's death sad? Just say one thing?"  "That's..." Draco difficulty finding words again. "I know, I know feel, see Harry, even I say Lily Potter's death sad, that's already going Death Eaters!"  "Draco, got able say Death Eaters wrong things! You to, can't progress scientist otherwise, there'll roadblock way, authority can't contradict. Not every change improvement, every improvement change, can't anything better unless manage differently, got let better people! Even father, Draco, even him. You've got able point something father say mistaken, perfect, can't say that, can't better."  Father warned him, every night went sleep month went Hogwarts, would people goal.  "You're trying break loose Father."  "Trying break part loose," said Harry. "Trying let fix things father got mistaken. Trying let better. But not... trying break Patronus!" Harry's voice got softer. "I want break something bright like that. Who knows, fixing Slytherin House might need that, too..."  It getting Draco, thing, despite everything getting him, really careful around Harry arguments sounded convincing even wrong. "And admitting Dumbledore told could avenge parents' deaths taking Lord Malfoy's son -"  "No. No. That part's wrong." Harry took deep breath. "I know Dumbledore was, Dark Lord was, Death Eaters were, parents died, three days I came Hogwarts. The day I first met clothes shop, day I learned. And Dumbledore even like Muggle science, says doesn't, I got chance probe once. The thought taking revenge Death Eaters never crossed mind, even now. I know Malfoys I met clothes shop, I liked you."  There long silence.  "I wish I could trust you," Draco said. His voice shaking. "If I could know telling truth, everything would much simpler -"  And suddenly came Draco.  The way know whether Harry Potter really meant everything said, wanting fix Slytherin House, sad Mother died.  It would illegal, since he'd without Father's help, would dangerous, even trust Harry Potter help, but...  "All right," Draco said. "I've thought definitive experiment."  "What it?"  "I want give drop Veritaserum," Draco said. "Just one drop, can't lie, enough make answer anything. I know I'll get it, I'll make certain safe -"  "Um," Harry said. There helpless look face. "Draco, um -"  "Don't say it," Draco said. His voice firm calm. "If say no, that's experimental result right there."  "Draco, I'm Occlumens -"  "OH THAT IS SUCH A LIE -"  "I trained Mr. Bester. Professor Quirrell set up. Look, Draco, I'll take one drop Veritaserum get it, I'm warning I'm Occlumens. Not perfect Occlumens, Mr. Bester said I putting complete block, I could probably beat Veritaserum."  "You're first year Hogwarts! That's crazy!"  "Know Legilimens trust? I'll happy demonstrate - look, Draco, I'm sorry, fact I told count something? I could let it, know."  "WHY? Why always like this, Harry? Why mess everything even IMPOSSIBLE? And stop smiling, funny!"  "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I know funny, I -"  It took Draco get control.  But Harry right. Harry could let Draco administer Veritaserum. If really Occlumens... Draco know could ask try Legilimency, could least ask Professor Quirrell true... Could Draco trust Professor Quirrell? Maybe Professor Quirrell would say anything Harry asked to.  Then Draco remembered thing Harry told ask Professor Quirrell, thought different test.  "You know," said Draco. "You know costs me, I agree poison Slytherin's House hating Muggleborns, say Lily Potter's death sad. And that's part plan, tell not."  Harry said nothing, wise him.  "There's something I want return," said Draco. "And then, experimental test I want try -"   Draco pushed open door portraits directed them, time right door. Before small empty place stone set night sky. Not roof like one he'd dropped Harry from, tiny proper courtyard, far ground. With proper railings, elaborate traceries stone flushed seamlessly stone floor... How much artistry infused creation Hogwarts something still awed Draco every time thought it. There must way once, one could detailed much piece piece, castle changed every new piece like that. It far beyond wizardry fading days one would believed seen proof Hogwarts itself.  Cloudless cold, winter night sky; got dark long students' curfew, final days January.  The stars shining brightly, clear air.  Harry said stars would help him.  Draco touched chest wand, slid fingers practiced motion, said, "Thermos." A warmth spread him, starting heart; wind went blowing face, longer cold.  "Thermos," Harry's voice said behind him.  They went together railing, look ground long way below. Draco tried figure one towers could seen outside, found right quite seem picture Hogwarts looked outside. But ground always same; could see Forbidden Forest vague outline, moonlight glittering Hogwarts Lake.  "You know," Harry's voice said quietly beside arms leaned railing next Draco's, "one things Muggles get really wrong, turn lights night. Not even one hour every month, even fifteen minutes year. The photons scatter atmosphere wash brightest stars, night sky look all, unless go far away cities. Once looked sky Hogwarts, hard imagine living Muggle city, able see stars. You certainly want spend whole life Muggle cities, seen night sky Hogwarts."  Draco glanced Harry, found Harry craning neck stare Milky Way arched across darkness.  "Of course," Harry went on, voice still quiet, "you can't ever see stars properly Earth, either, air always gets way. You look somewhere else, want see real thing, stars burning hard bright, like true selves. Have ever wished could whisk night sky, Draco, go look see around Suns ours? If limit power magic, one things would do, could anything?"  There silence, Draco realized expected answer. "I think before," Draco said. Without conscious decision, voice came soft hushed Harry's. "Do really think anyone would ever able that?"  "I think it'll easy," said Harry. "But I know I mean spend whole life Earth."  It would something laugh at, Draco known Muggles already left, without even using magic.  "To pass test," Harry said, "I'm going to say means me, thought, whole thing, shorter version I tried explain before. But able see idea, general. So version thought, Draco, go stars, might find people there. And so, certainly look like do. There might things grown crystal, big pulsating blobs... might made magic, I think it. So strangeness, recognize person? Not shape, many arms legs has. Not sort substance made of, whether that's flesh crystal stuff I can't imagine. You would recognize people minds. And even minds work like do. But anything lives thinks knows want die, sad, Draco, sad person die, want to. Compared might there, every human ever lived, we're like brothers sisters, could hardly even tell us apart. The ones met us, see British French, able tell difference, they'd see human being. Humans love, hate, laugh, cry; them, ones there, would make us alike peas pod. They would different, though. Really different. But stop us, stop them, wanted friends together."  Harry raised wand then, Draco turned, looked away, promised; looked toward stone floor stone wall door set. For Draco promised look, tell anyone Harry said, anything happened night, though know secret.  "I dream," said Harry's voice, "that one day sentient beings judged patterns minds, color shape stuff they're made of, parents were. Because get along crystal things someday, silly would get along Muggleborns, shaped like us, think like us, alike us peas pod? The crystal things even able tell difference. How impossible imagine hatred poisoning Slytherin House would worth taking us stars? Every life precious, everything thinks knows want die. Lily Potter's life precious, Narcissa Malfoy's life precious, even though late now, sad died. But lives still alive fought for. Your life, life, Hermione Granger's life, lives Earth, lives beyond, defended protected, EXPECTO PATRONUM!"  And light.  Everything turned silver light, stone floor, stone wall, door, railings, dazzling reflection could hardly even see them, even air seemed shine, light grew brighter, brighter, brighter -  When light ended like shock, Draco's hand went automatically robe bring handkerchief, realized crying.  "There experimental result," Harry's voice said quietly. "I really mean it, thought."  Draco slowly turned toward Harry, lowered wand now.  "That, that's got trick, right?" Draco said. He take many shocks. "Your Patronus - can't really bright -" And yet Patronus light, knew looking at, mistake anything else.  "That true form Patronus Charm," Harry said. "Something lets put strength Patronus, without hindrance within yourself. And ask, I learn Dumbledore. He know secret, could cast true form did. I solved puzzle myself. And I knew, I understood, spell must spoken of. For sake, I undertook test; must speak it, Draco."  Draco know more, know true strength lay, right things. Double vision, double vision. Draco wanted call Harry's ideals weakness, Hufflepuff foolishness, sort lie rulers told placate populace Harry silly enough believe himself, foolishness taken seriously raised insane heights, projected onto stars -  Something beautiful hidden, mysterious bright -  "Will I," whispered Draco, "be able cast Patronus like that, someday?"  "If always keep seeking truth," Harry said, "and refuse warm thoughts find them, I'm sure will. I think person could get anywhere kept going long enough, even stars."  Draco wiped eyes handkerchief again.  "We go back inside," Draco said unsteady voice, "someone could've seen it, light -"  Harry nodded, moved door; Draco looked night sky one last time followed.  Who Boy-Who-Lived, already Occlumens, could cast true form Patronus Charm, strange things? What Harry's Patronus, must stay unseen?  Draco ask questions, Harry might answered, Draco take shocks today. He couldn't. One shock head going fall right shoulders go bounce, bounce, bounce corridors Hogwarts.   They'd ducked small alcove, instead going way back classroom, Draco's request; feeling nervous put longer.  Draco put Quieting barrier, looked Harry silent question.  "I've thinking it," Harry said. "I'll it, five conditions -"  "Five?"  "Yes, five. Look, Draco, pledge like begging go terribly wrong somehow, know would go wrong play -"  "Well, not!" Draco said. "Dumbledore killed Mother. He's evil. It's one things talk complicated."  "Draco," Harry said, voice careful, "all I know say Lucius says Dumbledore says killed Narcissa. To believe unquestioningly, I trust Lucius Dumbledore. So like I said, conditions. The first one point release pledge, longer seems like good idea. It deliberate intended decision part, course, trick wording something."  "Okay," said Draco. That sounded safe enough.  "Condition two I'm pledging take enemy whoever actually kill Narcissa, determined honest best ability rationalist. Whether that's Dumbledore, someone else. And word I'll exercise best ability rationalist keep judgment honest, question simple fact. Agreed?"  "I like it," said Draco. He didn't, whole point make sure Harry never went Dumbledore. Still, Harry honest, he'd catch Dumbledore soon enough; dishonest, he'd already broken word... "But I'll agree."  "Condition three Narcissa burned alive. If part story turns something exaggerated make sound little worse, I get decide whether still go pledge. Good people sometimes kill. But ever torture people death. It's Narcissa burned alive I know whoever evil."  Draco kept temper, barely.  "Condition four Narcissa got hands dirty, and, say, Crucioed someone's child insanity, person burned Narcissa revenge, deal might again. Because still wrong burn her, still killed without pain; evil way Lucius's love never anything herself, like said. Condition five whoever killed Narcissa tricked somehow it, enemy whoever tricked them, person tricked."  "All really sounds like planning weasel -"  "Draco, I take good person enemy, anyone. I really believe they're wrong. But I've thought it, seems Narcissa evil hands, fell love Lucius chose stay wife, whoever burned alive bedroom likely good guy. And I'll pledge take enemy whoever made happen, whether Dumbledore anyone else, unless deliberately release pledge. Hopefully go wrong way would play."  "I'm happy," said Draco. "But okay. You pledge take mother's murderer enemy, I'll -"  Harry waited, patient look face, Draco tried make voice work again.  "I'll help fix problem Slytherin House hating Muggleborns," Draco finished whisper. "And I'll say sad Lily Potter died."  "So it," said Harry.  And done.  The break, Draco knew, widened little more. No, little, lot. There sensation drifting away, lost, further shore, further home...  "Excuse me," Draco said. He turned away Harry, tried calm himself, test, want fail nervous ashamed.  Draco raised wand starting position Patronus Charm.  Remembered falling broomstick, pain, fear, imagined coming tall figure cloak, looking like dead thing left water.  And Draco closed eyes, better remember Father holding small, cold hands warm strength.  Don't frightened, son, I'm here...  The wand swung broad brandish, drive fear away, Draco surprised strength it; remembered moment Father lost, would never lost, would always strong person, matter happened Draco, voice cried, "Expecto Patronum!"  Draco opened eyes.  A shining snake looked back him, less bright before.  Behind him, heard Harry exhale breath, though relief.  Draco gazed white light. It seemed lost completely, all.  "That reminds me," said Harry while. "Can test hypothesis use Patronus send messages?"  "Is going surprise me?" said Draco. "I want surprises today."   Harry claimed idea strange see could possibly shock Draco way, made Draco feel even nervous, somehow; Draco could see important way sending messages emergencies.  The trick - Harry hypothesized - wanting spread good news, wanting recipient know truth whatever happy thought used cast Patronus Charm. Only instead telling recipient words, Patronus message. By wanting see that, Patronus would go them.  "Tell Harry," said Draco luminous snake, even though Harry standing paces away side room, "to, um, beware green monkey," sign play Draco seen.  And then, like King's Cross station, Draco wanted Harry know Father always cared him; time try say words, wanted say happy thought itself.  The bright snake slithered across room, looking like slithering air rather stone itself; got Harry traveling short distance -  - said Harry, strange voice Draco recognized probably sounded people, "Beware green monkey."  "Hsssss ssss sshsshssss," said Harry.  The snake slithered back across floor Draco.  "Harry says message received acknowledged," said shining Blue Krait Draco's voice.  "Huh," Harry said. "Talking Patronuses feels odd."  ...  ...  ...  ...  "Why looking like that?" said Heir Slytherin.   Aftermath:  Harry stared Draco.  "You mean magical snakes, right?"  "N-no," said Draco. He looking rather pale, still stammering, least stopped incoherent noises he'd making earlier. "You're Parselmouth, speak Parseltongue, language snakes everywhere. You understand snake talks, understand talk them... Harry, can't possibly believe Sorted Ravenclaw! You're Heir Slytherin!"  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  "SNAKES ARE SENTIENT?"   Chapter 48: Utilitarian Priorities  It Saturday, first morning February, Ravenclaw table, boy bearing breakfast plate heaped high vegetables nervously inspecting servings slightest trace meat.  It might overreaction. After he'd gotten raw shock, Harry's common sense woken hypothesized "Parseltongue" probably linguistic user interface controlling snakes...  ...after all, snakes really human-level intelligent, someone would noticed now. The smallest-brained creatures Harry ever heard anything like linguistic ability African grey parrots taught Irene Pepperberg. And unstructured protolanguage, species played complex games adultery needed model parrots. While according Draco able remember, snakes spoke Parselmouths sounded like normal human language - i.e., full-blown recursive syntactical grammar. That taken time hominids evolve, huge brains strong social selection pressures. Snakes much society Harry ever heard. And thousands upon thousands different species snakes world, could use version supposed language, "Parseltongue"?  Of course merely common sense, Harry starting lose faith entirely.  But Harry sure he'd heard snakes hissing TV point - all, knew sounded like somewhere - sounded like language, seemed good deal reassuring...  ...at first. The problem Draco also asserted Parselmouths could send snakes extended complex missions. And true, Parselmouths make snakes persistently intelligent talking them. In worst-case scenario would make snake self-aware, like Harry accidentally done Sorting Hat.  And Harry offered hypothesis, Draco claimed could remember story - Harry hoped Cthulhu one story fairy tale, ring it, story - Salazar Slytherin sending brave young viper mission gather information snakes.  If snake Parselmouth talked to, could make snakes self-aware talking them, then...  Then...  Harry even know mind going "then... then..." knew perfectly well exponential progression would work, sheer moral horror blowing mind.  And someone invented spell like talk cows?  What Poultrymouths?  Or matter...  Harry froze sudden realization forkful carrots enter mouth.  That couldn't, possibly true, surely wizard would stupid enough THAT...  And Harry knew, dreadful sinking feeling, course would stupid. Salazar Slytherin probably never considered moral implications snake intelligence even one second, like ever occurred Salazar Muggleborns intelligent enough deserve personhood rights. Most people see moral issues unless someone else pointing out...  "Harry?" said Terry beside him, sounding like afraid would regret asking. "Why staring fork like that?"  "I'm starting think magic illegal," said Harry. "By way, ever heard stories wizards could speak plants?"   Terry heard anything like that.  Neither seventh-year Ravenclaws Harry asked.  And Harry returned place, yet sat again, staring plate vegetables forlorn expression. He getting hungrier, later day would visiting Mary's Place one incredibly tasty dishes... Harry finding sorely tempted revert back yesterday's eating habits done it.  You've got eat something, said inner Slytherin. And much likely anyone sneezed self-awareness onto poultry onto plants, long eating food questionable sentience either way, eat delicious deep-fried Diracawl slices?  I'm quite sure that's valid utilitarian logic, -  Oh, want utilitarian logic? One serving utilitarian logic coming up: Even unlikely chance moron manage confer sentience chickens, research stands best chance discovering fact something it. If complete work even slightly faster messing around diet, then, counterintuitive may seem, best thing save greatest number possibly-sentient who-knows-whats wasting time wild guesses might intelligent. It's like house elves prepared food already, regardless take onto plate.  Harry considered moment. It rather seductive line reasoning -  Good! said Slytherin. I'm glad see moral thing to sacrifice lives sentient beings convenience, feed dreadful appetites, sick pleasure ripping apart teeth -  What? Harry thought indignantly. Which side here?  His inner Slytherin's mental voice grim. You someday embrace doctrine... end justifies meats. This followed mental snickering.  Ever since Harry started worrying plants might also sentient, non-Ravenclaw components trouble taking moral caution seriously. Hufflepuff shouting Cannibalism! every time Harry tried think food item whatsoever, Gryffindor would visualize screaming ate it, even was, say, sandwich -  Cannibalism!  AIIIEEEE DON'T EAT ME -  Ignore screams, eat anyway! It's safe place compromise ethics service higher goals, everyone else thinks okay eat sandwiches can't use usual rationalization small probability large downside get caught -  Harry gave mental sigh, thought, Just long okay us eaten giant monsters enough research whether sentient.  I'm okay that, said Slytherin. Is everyone else okay that? (Internal mental nods.) Great, go back deep-fried Diracawl slices now?  Not I've done research what's sentient isn't. Now shut up. And Harry turned firmly away plate full oh-so-tempting vegetables head toward library -  Just eat students, said Hufflepuff. There's doubt whether they're sentient.  You know want to, said Gryffindor. I bet young ones tastiest.  Harry starting wonder Dementor somehow damaged imaginary personalities.   "Honestly," said Hermione. The young girl's voice sounded little acerbic gaze scanned bookshelves Herbology stacks Hogwarts library. Harry left message asking could come library she'd finished breakfast, Harry skipped; Harry introduced day's topic she'd seemed bit nonplussed. "You know problem, Harry? You've got sense priorities. An idea gets head go running straight it."  "I've got great sense priorities," said Harry. His hand reached grabbed Vegetable Cunning Casey McNamara, began flip starting pages, searching table contents. "That's I want find whether plants talk I eat carrots."  "Don't think maybe two us important things worry about?"  You sound like Draco, Harry thought, course say loud. Out loud said, "What could possibly important plants turning sentient?"  There pregnant silence beside him, Harry's eyes went table contents. There indeed chapter Plant Language, causing Harry's heart skip beat; hands began rapidly turn pages, heading appropriate page number.  "There days," said Hermione Granger, "when I really, truly, absolutely idea goes inside head yours."  "Look, question multiplication, okay? There's lot plants world, they're sentient they're important, plants people they've got moral weight human beings world put together. Now, course brain realize intuitive level, that's brain can't multiply. Like ask three separate groups Canadian households much they'll pay save two thousand, twenty thousand, two hundred thousand birds dying oil ponds, three groups respectively state they're willing pay seventy-eight, eighty-eight, eighty dollars. No difference, words. It's called scope insensitivity. Your brain imagines single bird struggling oil pond, image creates amount emotion determines willingness pay. But one visualize even two thousand anything, quantity gets thrown straight window. Now try correct bias respect hundred trillion sentient blades grass, realize could thousands times important used think whole human species was... oh thank Azathoth, says magical plants talk speak regular human language loud, there's spell use talk plant -"  "Ron came breakfast yesterday morning," Hermione said. Now voice sounded little quiet, little sad, maybe even little scared. "He said he'd dreadfully shocked see kiss you. That said Demented shown much evil hiding inside. And I going follower Dark Wizard, sure wanted army anymore."  Harry's hands stopped turning pages. It seemed Harry's brain, abstract knowledge, still incapable appreciating scope real emotional level, forcibly redirected attention away trillions possibly-sentient blades grass might suffering dying even spoke, toward life single human happened nearer dearer.  "Ron world's gigantic prat," Harry said. "They printing newspaper anytime soon, news. So fired him, many arms legs break?"  "I tried tell like that," Hermione went quiet voice. "I tried tell like that, like two us, seemed make even more... like was."  "Well, yes," Harry said. He surprised feeling angrier Captain Weasley, concern Hermione seemed overriding that, now. "The try justify people like that, acknowledges right question you. It shows think get inquisitor, grant someone sort power you, push more." This one Draco Malfoy's lessons Harry thought actually pretty smart: people tried defend got questioned every little point could never satisfy interrogators; made clear start celebrity social conventions, people's minds bother tracking violations. "That's Ron came I sitting Ravenclaw table, told stay away you, I held hand floor said, 'You see high I'm holding hand? Your intelligence least high talk me.' Then accused of, quote, sucking darkness, unquote, I pursed lips went schluuuuurp, mouth still making talking noises I put Quieting Charm. I think he'll trying lectures again."  "I understand that," Hermione said, voice tight, "I wanted tell too, I really wish hadn't, make things harder me, Harry!"  Harry looked Vegetable Cunning again, getting reading done rate; saw Hermione still reading whatever book had, looking him. Her hands turned another page even watched.  "I think taking wrong approach trying defend all," Harry said. "I really think that. You are. You're friends whoever choose. Tell anyone questions shove it."  Hermione shook head, turned another page.  "Option two," Harry said. "Go Fred George tell little talk wayward brother, two genuine good guys -"  "It's Ron," Hermione said almost whisper. "Lots people saying it, Harry. Even Mandy giving worried looks thinks I'm looking. Isn't funny? I keep worrying Professor Quirrell sucking darkness, people warning way I try warn you."  "Well, yeah," said Harry. "Doesn't reassure bit Professor Quirrell?"  "In word," said Hermione, "no."  There silence lasted long enough Hermione turn another page, voice, real whisper time, "And, Padma going around telling everyone that, since I cast P-Patronus Charm, I must p-pretending n-nice..."  "Padma even try herself!" Harry said indignantly. "If Dark Witch pretending, tried front everyone, think stupid?"  Hermione smiled little, blinked times.  "Hey, I worry actually going evil. Here worst case scenario people think evil really are. Is going kill you? I mean, bad?"  The young girl nodded, face screwed tight.  "Look, Hermione... worry much people think, unhappy whenever people picture exactly way picture yourself, that's already dooming always unhappy. No one ever thinks us way think ourselves."  "I know explain you," Hermione said sad soft voice. "I'm sure something could ever understand, Harry. All I think say is, would feel I thought evil?"  "Um..." Harry visualized it. "Yeah, would hurt. A lot. But good person thinks sort thing intelligently, earned power me, would mean something thought I'd gone wrong. I can't think single student, besides you, whose opinion I'd care way -"  "You live like that," whispered Hermione Granger. "I can't."  The girl gone another three pages silence, Harry returned eyes book trying regain focus, Hermione finally said, small voice, "Are really sure I know cast Patronus Charm?"  "I..." Harry swallow sudden lump throat. He suddenly saw knowing Patronus Charm work him, able show Draco, told reason, nothing more. "Hermione, Patronus would shine light normal, look like people think Patronuses look, anyone saw would know something strange going on. Even I told secret demonstrate anyone, unless made face way could see light, and... important part secret knowledge secret exists, could show one two friends swore secrecy..." Harry's voice trailed helplessly.  "I'll take it." Her voice still small.  It hard blurt secret, right library.  "I, I shouldn't, I really shouldn't, dangerous, Hermione, could lot harm secret got out! Haven't heard saying, three keep secret two dead? That telling closest friends telling everyone, trusting them, trusting everyone trust? It's important, much risk, sort decision made sake fixing someone's reputation school!"  "Okay," Hermione said. She closed book put back shelf. "I can't concentrate right now, Harry, I'm sorry."  "If there's anything else I -"  "Be nicer everyone."  The girl look back walked stacks, might good thing, boy frozen place, unmoving.  After while, boy started turning pages again.   Chapter 49: Prior Information  A boy waits small clearing edge non-forbidden forest, beside dirt trail runs back gates Hogwarts one direction, distance another. There carriage nearby, boy standing well away it, looking it, eyes seldom wavering direction.  In distance, figure approaching along dirt path: A man wearing professorial robes, trudging slowly shoulders slumped low, formal shoes kicking small clouds dust walks.  Half minute later, boy darts another quick glance returning surveillance; glimpse shows man's shoulders straightened, face unslackened, shoes walking lightly across dirt, leaving trace dust air behind.  "Hello, Professor Quirrell," Harry said without letting eyes move direction carriage.  "Salutations," said calm voice Professor Quirrell. "You seem keeping distance, Mr. Potter. I suppose see something odd conveyance?"  "Odd?" Harry echoed. "Why no, I can't say I see anything odd. There seem even numbers everything. Four seats, four wheels, two huge skeletal winged horses..."  A skin-wrapped skull turned look flashed teeth, solid white black cavernous mouth, though indicate fond of it. The black leathery horse-skeleton tossed head like whickering, sound.  "They Thestrals, always drawn carriage," Professor Quirrell said, sounding quite undisturbed climbed front bench carriage, sitting far right possible. "They visible seen death comprehended it, useful defense animal predators. Hm. I suppose first time went front Dementor, worst memory proved night encounter He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?"  Harry nodded grimly. It right guess, even wrong reasons. Those seen Death...  "Did recall anything interest, thereby?"  "Yes," Harry said, "I did," nothing more, ready yet make accusations.  The Defense Professor smiled one dry smiles, beckoned impatient finger.  Harry closed distance climbed carriage, wincing. The sense doom grown significantly stronger day Dementor, even though slowly weakening then. The greatest distance carriage allowed Professor Quirrell longer seemed like nearly far enough.  Then skeletal horses trotted forward carriage started motion, taking toward outer bounds Hogwarts. As did, Professor Quirrell slumped back zombie-mode, sense doom retreated, though still hovered edge Harry's perceptions, unignorable...  The forest scrolled carriage rolled along, trees moving past speed seemed positively glacial comparison broomsticks even cars. There something oddly relaxing, Harry thought, traveling slowly. It certainly relaxed Defense Professor, slumped small stream drool coming slack mouth puddling robes.  Harry still decided allowed eat lunch.  His library research turned sign wizards speaking nonmagical plants. Or nonmagical animals besides snakes, although Spell Speak Paul Breedlove recounted probably-mythical tale sorceress called Lady Flying Squirrels.  What Harry wanted ask Professor Quirrell. The problem Professor Quirrell smart. Judging Draco said, Heir Slytherin business major bombshell, Harry sure wanted anyone else know. And instant Harry asked Parseltongue, Professor Quirrell would fix pale blue eyes say, 'I see, Mr. Potter, taught Mr. Malfoy Patronus Charm accidentally spoke snake.'  It matter enough evidence locate true explanation hypothesis, let alone overcome burden prior improbability. Somehow Defense Professor would deduce anyway. There times Harry suspected Professor Quirrell way background information telling, priors simply good. Sometimes got amazing deductions right even reasons wrong. The problem Harry see Professor Quirrell could've snuck extra clue half stuff guessed. Just Harry would liked make sort incredible deduction something Professor Quirrell said would catch completely guard.   "I shall bowl green lentil soup, soy sauce," Professor Quirrell said waitress. "And Mr. Potter, plate Tenorman's family chili."  Harry hesitated sudden dismay. He'd resolved stick vegetarian dishes moment, he'd forgotten deliberations Professor Quirrell actual ordering - would awkward protested -  The waitress bowed them, turned go -  "Erm, excuse me, meat snakes flying squirrels?"  The waitress much blink eye, turned back Harry, shook head, bowed politely again, resumed walk toward door.  (The parts Harry snickering him. Gryffindor making sardonic comments little social discomfort enough get resort Cannibalism! (shouted Hufflepuff), Slytherin remarking nice Harry's ethics flexible came important goals like maintaining relationship Professor Quirrell.)  After waitress closed door behind her, Professor Quirrell waved hand slide home locking bar, spoke usual four Charms ensure privacy, said, "An interesting question, Mr. Potter. I wonder asked it?"  Harry kept face steady. "I looking facts Patronus Charm earlier," said. "According The Patronus Charm: Wizards Who Could Couldn't, turns Godric Salazar could. I surprised, I looked reference, Four Lives Power. And I discovered Salazar Slytherin could supposedly talk snakes." (Temporal sequence causation, Harry's fault Professor Quirrell missed that.) "Further research turned old story mother goddess type could talk flying squirrels. I bit worried prospect eating something could talk."  And Harry took casual sip water -  - Professor Quirrell said, "Mr. Potter, would I correct guessing also Parselmouth?"  When Harry done coughing, set glass water back table, fixed gaze Professor Quirrell's chin rather looking eyes, said, "So able perform Legilimency Occlumency barriers, then."  Professor Quirrell grinning widely. "I shall take compliment, Mr. Potter, no."  "I'm buying anymore," Harry said. "There's way came conclusion based evidence."  "Of course not," Professor Quirrell said equably. "I planned ask question today case, simply chose opportune moment. I suspected since December, fact -"  "December?" said Harry. "I found yesterday!"  "Ah, realize Sorting Hat's message Parseltongue?"  The Defense Professor timed exactly right second time, too, Harry taking gulp water clear throat first coughing fit.  Harry realized, now. Of course obvious instant Professor Quirrell said it. Right, Professor McGonagall even told talk snakes anyone could see him, he'd thought she'd meant seen talking statues architectural features Hogwarts looked like snakes. Double illusion transparency, he'd thought understood her, she'd thought understood - hell -  "So," Harry said, "you performed Legilimency first Defense class, find happened Sorting Hat -"  "Then I would found December." Professor Quirell leaned back, smiling. "This puzzle solve own, Mr. Potter, I reveal answer. Over winter holiday, I alerted fact Headmaster filed request closed judicial panel review case one Mr. Rubeus Hagrid, know Keeper Keys Grounds Hogwarts, accused murder Abigail Myrtle 1943."  "Oh, course," said Harry, "that makes downright obvious I'm Parselmouth. Professor, sweet slithering snakes -"  "The suspect murder Slytherin's Monster, legendary inhabitant Slytherin's Chamber Secrets. Which certain sources alerted fact, caught attention sufficiently I spent good deal bribe money learn details case. Now point fact, Mr. Potter, Mr. Hagrid innocent. Ridiculously obviously innocent. He blatantly innocent bystander convicted magical British legal system since Grindelwald's Confunding Neville Chamberlain pinned Amanda Knox. Headmaster Dippet prompted student puppet accuse Mr. Hagrid Dippet needed scapegoat take blame death Miss Myrtle, marvelous justice system agreed plausible enough warrant Mr. Hagrid's expulsion snapping wand. Our current Headmaster needs merely provide new item evidence significant enough reconvene case; Dumbledore applying pressure instead Dippet, result foregone conclusion. Lucius Malfoy particular reason fear Mr. Hagrid's vindication; thus Lucius Malfoy resist extent costlessly order impose costs Dumbledore, Dumbledore clearly willing prosecute case regardless."  Professor Quirrell took sip water. "But I digress. The new evidence Headmaster promises provide exhibit previously undetected spell Sorting Hat, which, Headmaster asserts, personally determined respond Slytherins also Parselmouths. The Headmaster argues favors interpretation Chamber Secrets indeed opened 1943, approximately right time frame He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, known Parselmouth, attended Hogwarts. It rather questionable logic, judicial panel may rule swings case far enough bring Mr. Hagrid's guilt doubt, manage keep straight face say it. And come key question: Headmaster discover hidden spell Sorting Hat?"  Professor Quirrell smiling thinly now. "Well now, let us suppose Parselmouth year's crop students, potential Heir Slytherin. You must admit, Mr. Potter, stand possibility whenever extraordinary people considered. And I ask new Slytherin would likely mental privacy invaded Headmaster, specifically hunting memories Sorting, why, stand even more." The smile vanished. "So see, Mr. Potter, I invaded mind, though I ask apologize. It fault believed Dumbledore's protestations respecting mental privacy."  "My sincere apologies," Harry said, keeping face expressionless. The rigid control confession right, sweat beading forehead; think Defense Professor would take evidence that. Professor Quirrell would think Harry nervous discovered Heir Slytherin. Rather nervous Professor Quirrell might realize Harry deliberately betrayed Slytherin's secret... longer seeming like smart move.  "So, Mr. Potter. Any progress finding Chamber Secrets?"  No, thought Harry. But maintain plausible deniability, needed general policy sometimes evading questions even nothing hide... "With respect, Professor Quirrell, I made progress, quite obvious I tell it."  Professor Quirrell sipped waterglass again. "Well then, Mr. Potter, I shall freely tell I know suspect. First, I believe Chamber Secrets real, Slytherin's Monster. Miss Myrtle's death discovered hours demise, even though wards alerted Headmaster instantly. Therefore murder performed either Headmaster Dippet, unlikely, entity Salazar Slytherin keyed wards higher level Headmaster himself. Second, I suspect contrary popular legend, purpose Slytherin's Monster rid Hogwarts Muggleborns. Unless Slytherin's Monster powerful enough defeat Headmaster Hogwarts teachers, could triumph force. Multiple murders secrecy would result school's closure, nearly happened 1943, placing new wards. So Slytherin's Monster, Mr. Potter? What true purpose serve?"  "Ah..." Harry dropped gaze waterglass tried think. "To kill anyone got Chamber belong -"  "A monster powerful enough defeat team wizards broken past best wards Salazar could place Chamber? Unlikely."  Harry feeling bit pressured now. "Well, called Chamber Secrets, maybe Monster secret, secret?" For matter, sort secrets Chamber Secrets first place? Harry done lot research subject, part he'd gotten impression nobody knew anything -  Professor Quirrell smiling. "Why write secret down?"  "Ahhh..." said Harry. "Because Monster spoke Parseltongue, would ensure true descendant Slytherin could hear secret?"  "Easy enough key wards Chamber phrase spoken Parseltongue. Why go trouble creating Slytherin's Monster? It cannot easy create creature lifespan centuries. Come, Mr. Potter, obvious; secrets told one living mind another, never written down?"  Harry saw then, burst adrenaline started heart racing, breath coming faster. "Oh."  Salazar Slytherin cunning indeed. Cunning enough come way bypass Interdict Merlin.  Powerful wizardries transmitted books ghosts, could create long-lived enough sentient creature good enough memory -  "It seems probable me," said Professor Quirrell, "that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named began climb power secrets obtained Slytherin's Monster. That Salazar's lost knowledge source You-Know-Who's extraordinarily powerful wizardry. Hence interest Chamber Secrets case Mr. Hagrid."  "I see," Harry said. And he, Harry, could find Salazar's Chamber Secrets... lost knowledge Lord Voldemort obtained would well.  Yes. That story go.  Add Harry's superior intelligence original magical research Muggle rocket launchers, resulting fight would completely one-sided, exactly Harry wanted it.  Harry grinning now, evil grin. New priority: Find everything Hogwarts looks remotely like snake try speaking it. Starting everything already tried, time sure use Parseltongue instead English - get Draco let Slytherin dorms -  "Don't become excited, Mr. Potter," said Professor Quirrell. His face become expressionless, now. "You must continue thinking. What Dark Lord's parting words Slytherin's Monster?"  "What?" Harry said. "How could either us possibly know that?"  "Visualize scene, Mr. Potter. Let imagination fill details. Slytherin's Monster - probably great serpent, Parselmouth may speak - finished imparting knowledge possesses He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. It conveys Salazar's final benediction, warns Chamber Secrets must remain closed next descendant Salazar prove cunning enough open it. And become Dark Lord nods, says -"  "Avada Kedavra," said Harry, suddenly feeling sick stomach.  "Rule Twelve," Professor Quirrell said quietly. "Never leave source power lying around someone else find it."  Harry's gaze dropped tablecloth, decorated mournful pattern black flowers shadows. Somehow seemed... sad imagined, Slytherin's great snake wanted help Lord Voldemort, Lord Voldemort just... something unbearably sorrowful it, sort person would who'd offered nothing friendship... "Do think Dark Lord would -"  "Yes," Professor Quirrell said flatly. "He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named left quite trail bodies behind him, Mr. Potter; I doubt would omitted one. If artifacts left could moved, Dark Lord would taken well. There might still something worth seeing Chamber Secrets, find would prove true Heir Slytherin. But raise hopes high. I suspect find remains Slytherin's Monster resting quietly grave."  They sat silence while.  "I could wrong," said Professor Quirrell. "In end guess. But I wish warn you, Mr. Potter, would sorely disappointed."  Harry nodded shortly.  "One might even regret infant self's victory," said Professor Quirrell. His smile twisted. "If You-Know-Who lived, might persuaded teach knowledge would heritage, one Heir Slytherin another." The smile twisted further, though mock obvious impossibility, even given premise.  Note self, thought Harry, slight chill edge anger, make sure extract heritage Dark Lord's mind, one way another.  There another silence. Professor Quirrell looking Harry though waiting ask something.  "Well," said Harry, "so long we're topic, I ask think whole Parselmouth business actually -"  There came knock door, then. Professor Quirrell raised cautionary finger, opened door wave. The waitress entered, balancing huge platter meals though whole assembly weighed nothing (which fact probably case). She gave Professor Quirrell bowl green soup, glass usual Chianti; set Harry plate small meat strips smothered heavy-looking sauce, plus glass accustomed treacle soda. Then bowed, managing make seem like sincere respect rather perfunctory acknowledgment, departed.  When gone, Professor Quirrell held finger silence again, drew wand.  And Professor Quirrell began performing certain series incantations Harry recognized, making take sharp breath. It series ordering Mr. Bester used, full set twenty-seven spells would perform discussing anything truly great import.  If discussion Chamber Secrets counted important -  When Professor Quirrell done - he'd performed thirty spells, three Harry heard - Defense Professor said, "Now shall interrupted time. Can keep secret, Mr. Potter?"  Harry nodded.  "A serious secret, Mr. Potter," Professor Quirrell said. His eyes intent, face grave. "One could potentially send Azkaban. Think reply."  For moment Harry even see question hard, given growing collection secrets. Then -  If secret could send Professor Quirrell Azkaban, means he's done something illegal...  Harry's brain performed calculations. Whatever secret, Professor Quirrell think illegal act would reflect badly Harry's eyes. There advantage gained hearing it. And reveal something wrong Professor Quirrell, much Harry's advantage know it, even promised tell anyone.  "I never much respect authority," Harry said. "Legal governmental authority included. I keep secret."  Harry bother asking whether revelation worth danger would pose Professor Quirrell. The Defense Professor stupid.  "Then I must test whether truly descendant Salazar," said Professor Quirrell, stood chair. Harry, prompted reflex instinct calculation, shoved chair well.  There blur, shift, sudden motion.  Harry aborted panicked backward leap halfway through, leaving windmilling arms trying fall over, frantic flush adrenaline running him.  At end room swayed snake meter high, bright green intricately banded white blue. Harry know enough snakelore recognize it, knew 'brightly colored' meant 'poisonous'.  The constant sense doom diminished, ironically enough, Defense Professor Hogwarts turned venomous snake.  Harry swallowed hard said, "Greetings - ah, hssss, no, ah, greetingss."  "Sso," hissed snake. "You sspeak, I hear. I sspeak, hear?"  "Yess, I hear," hissed Harry. "You Animaguss?"  "Obvioussly," hissed snake. "Thirty-sseven ruless, number thirty-four: Become Animaguss. All ssensible people do, can. Thuss, rare." The snake's eyes flat surfaces ensconced within dark pits, sharp black pupils dark gray fields. "This iss mosst ssecure way sspeak. You ssee? No otherss undersstand uss."  "Even ssnake Animagi?"  "Not unlesss heir Sslytherin willss." The snake gave series short hisses Harry's brain translated sardonic laughter. "Sslytherin sstupid. Ssnake Animaguss ssame Parsselmouth. Would huge flaw sscheme."  Well definitely argued Parseltongue personal magic, snakes sentient beings learnable language -  "I regisstered," hissed snake. The dark pits eyes stared Harry. "Animaguss musst regisstered. Penalty two yearss imprissonment. Will keep ssecret, boy?"  "Yess," hissed Harry. "Would never break promisse."  The snake seemed hold still, though shock, began sway again. "We come next sseven dayss. Bring cloak passs unsseen, bring hourglasss move time -"  "You know?" hissed Harry shock. "How -"  Again series short quick hisses translated sardonic laughter. "You arrive firsst classs sstill classs, sstrike enemy pie, two ballss memory -"  "Never mind," hissed Harry. "Sstupid question, forgot ssmart."  "Foolissh thing forget," said snake, hiss seem offended.  "Hourglasss resstricted," Harry said. "Cannot usse ninth hour."  The snake twitched head, snakish nod. "Many resstrictionss. Locked usse only, cannot sstolen. Cannot transsport humanss. But ssnake carried pouch, I ssuspect go with. Think posssible hold hourglasss motionlesss within sshell, without dissturbing wardss, turn sshell around it. We tesst sseven dayss. Will sspeak planss beyond thiss. You ssay nothing, one. Give ssign expectancy, none. Undersstand?"  Harry nodded.  "Ansswer sspeech."  "Yess."  "Will I ssaid?"  "Yess. But," Harry gave wobbling rasp mind translated hesitant 'Ahhh' snakish, "I promisse whatever thiss iss, ssaid -"  The snake performed shiver Harry's mind translated severe glare. "Of coursse not. Will disscusss sspecificss next meeting."  The blur motion reversed itself, Professor Quirrell standing more. For moment Defense Professor seemed sway, snake swayed, eyes seemed cold flat; shoulders straightened human more.  And aura doom returned.  Professor Quirrell's chair scooted back him, sat it. "No sense letting go waste," Professor Quirrell said picked spoon, "though moment I would much prefer live mouse. One never quite disentangle mind body wears, see..."  Harry slowly took seat began eating.   "So line Salazar die You-Know-Who all," said Professor Quirrell time. "It would seem rumors already begun spread, among fine student body, Dark; I wonder would think, knew that."  "Or knew I destroyed Dementor," Harry said, shrugged. "I figure fuss blow over next time I something interesting. Hermione trouble, though, I wondering might suggestions her."  The Defense Professor ate several spoonfuls soup silence, then; spoke again, voice oddly flat. "You really care girl."  "Yes," Harry said quietly.  "I suppose able bring Dementation?"  "More less," Harry said. The statement true way, exact; Demented self cared, confused.  "I friends like I young." Still emotionless voice. "What would become you, I wonder, alone?"  Harry shivered could stop himself.  "You must feeling grateful her."  Harry nodded. Not quite exact, true.  "Then I might done age, anyone -"   Chapter 50: Self Centeredness  Padma Patil finished dinner little late, getting toward seven-thirty, striding quickly Great Hall way Ravenclaw dorm study rooms. Gossiping fun destroying Granger's reputation fun, could distract schoolwork. She'd put six-inch essay lomillialor wood due next morning's Herbology class, needed finish tonight.  It passing long, twisting, narrow stone corridor whisper came, sounding like coming right behind her.  "Padma Patil..."  She spun around quick lightning, wand already snatched pocket robes leaping hands, Harry Potter thought could sneak scare easily -  There one there.  Instantly Padma spun around looked direction, Ventriloquism Charm -  There one there, either.  The whispering sigh came again, soft dangerous slight hissing undertone.  "Padma Patil, Slytherin girl..."  "Harry Potter, Slytherin boy," said loud.  She'd fought Potter Chaos Legion dozen times over, knew Harry Potter somehow...  ...even though Ventriloquism Charm line-of-sight, winding corridor, could easily see way nearest twist forward backward, one there...  ...it matter. She knew enemy.  There whispery chuckle, coming beside her, spun around pointed wand whisper shouted "Luminos!"  The red bolt light shot struck wall, lit crimson glow soon faded.  She really expected work. Harry Potter possibly invisible, really invisible, magic grownups do, she'd never believed nine-tenths stories him.  The whispery voice laughed again, side.  "Harry Potter stands precipice," whispered voice, sounding close ear, "he wavering, you, already falling, Slytherin girl..."  "The hat never called Slytherin name, Potter!" She backed wall, watch behind herself, raised wand attack stance.  Again soft laugh. "Harry Potter Ravenclaw common room last half-hour, helping Kevin Entwhistle Michael Corner rehearse Potions recipes. But matters not. I deliver warning you, Padma Patil, choose ignore it, affair."  "Fine," said coldly. "Go ahead warn me, Potter, I'm afraid you."  "Slytherin great House, once," said whisper; sounded sadder, now. "Slytherin House would proud choose, Padma Patil. But something turned wrong, something turned sour; know went awry Slytherin House, Padma Patil?"  "No, I care!"  "But care," said whisper, sounding like coming behind head stood almost pressed wall. "For still girl Sorting Hat offered choice. Do think choosing Ravenclaw means Pansy Parkinson, ever become Pansy Parkinson, matter conduct otherwise?"  Despite everything, now, small chills fear spreading spine running skin. She'd heard stories Harry Potter too, secret Legilimens. But still stood straight, put bite could voice said, "The Slytherins went Dark get power, like did, Potter. And I won't, ever."  "But spread vicious rumors innocent girl," whispered voice, "even though help attain ambitions, without considering powerful allies might take offense. That is proud Slytherin old days, Padma Patil, pride Salazar, Slytherin gone rotten, Padma Parkinson Padma Malfoy..."  She getting creeped ever life, possibility starting occur might really ghost. She ever heard ghosts could hide like this, maybe usually - mention ghosts eerie, dead people - "Who you? The Bloody Baron?"  "When Harry Potter bullied beaten," voice whispered, "he commanded allies refrain vengeance; remember that, Padma Patil? For Harry Potter wavering, yet lost; struggling, knows peril. But Hermione Granger made request allies. Harry Potter angered now, Padma Patil, angered would ever behalf... allies own."  A shudder went her, knew visible hated it.  "Oh, afraid," breathed voice. "I hurt you. For see, Padma Patil, Hermione Granger truly innocent. She stand precipice, falling. She ask allies refrain hurting you, thought even occur possibility. And Harry Potter knows well hurt caused hurt, Hermione Granger's sake, would never speak Sun burned low last star failed night sky." The voice sad now. "She truly kindly girl, person I could wish be..."  "Granger can't cast Patronus Charm!" said Padma. "If really nice pretends -"  "Can cast Patronus Charm, Padma Patil? You dared even attempt it, feared result would be."  "That's true! I time, all!"  The whisper continued. "But Hermione Granger try, openly friends, magic failed surprised dismayed. For secrets Patronus Charm ever knew, maybe none know I." A soft, whispery chuckle. "Let stand stain spirit halts light coming forth. Hermione Granger cannot cast Patronus Charm reason Godric Gryffindor, raised halls, never could."  The corridor becoming colder, certain it, though someone using Chilling Charm.  "And Harry Potter Hermione Granger's ally." Now undertone dry amusement whisper, reminded suddenly frighteningly Professor Quirrell. "Filius Flitwick Minerva McGonagall quite fond her, I believe. Did occur two learned Hermione Granger, might become less fond you? They might intervene openly, perhaps; might little slower award House Points, little slower steer opportunities way -"  "Potter snarked me?"  A ghostly chuckle, dry heh-heh-heh. "Do think two stupid, deaf blind?" In sadder whisper, "Do think Hermione Granger precious them, see hurting? As might fond once, bright young Padma Patil, throwing away..."  Padma's throat dry. She thought that, all.  "I wonder many people end caring you, Padma Patil, path tread. Is worth much, distance sister? To shadow Parvati's light? Your deepest fear always fall harmony her, back harmony I say; worth hurting innocent girl, make much different? Must evil twin, Padma Patil, find different good pursue?"  Her heart hammering chest. She'd, she'd never talked anyone -  "I always wondered students bully other," sighed voice. "How children make life difficult themselves, turn schools prisons even hands. Why human beings make lives unpleasant? I give part answer, Padma Patil. It people stop think causing pain, imagine could also hurt, might also suffer misdeeds. But suffer will, oh, yes, Padma Patil, suffer will, stay road. You suffer pain loneliness, pain others' fear distrust, inflict Hermione Granger. Only deserved."  Her wand shaking hand.  "You choose sides went Ravenclaw, girl. You choose side way live life, people yourself. Will illuminate others' lives, darken them? That choice Light Dark, word Sorting Hat cries out. And hard part, Padma Patil, saying 'Light', hard part deciding which, admitting begin wrong road."  There silence. It went time, Padma realized dismissed.  Padma almost dropped wand, tried put back pocket. She almost fell, took step forward away wall, turned go -  "I always chosen rightly beween Light Dark," whisper said, loud harsh directly ear. "Do take wisdom final word, girl, fear question it, though I tried I sometimes failed, oh, yes, I failed. But hurting true innocent, achieve none ambitions so, cunning plan. You inflicting pain purely sake pleasure brings you. I always chosen rightly Light Dark, I know darkness, certain. You hurting innocent girl, escaping retribution kindly tolerate allies moving you. I cannot hurt that, know I cannot respect it. You unworthy Slytherin; go Herbology homework, Ravenclaw girl!"  The final whisper came louder hiss sounded almost like snake, Padma fled, fled corridors like Lethifolds chasing her, ran heedless rules running corridors, even passed students looked surprise, stop, ran way Ravenclaw dorms pulse pounding neck, door asked "Why Sun shine day instead nighttime?" took three tries could make answer coherent, door came open saw -  - girls boys, young old, staring her, one corner pentagonal table, Harry Potter Michael Corner Kevin Entwhistle, looking textbooks.  "Sweet Merlin!" exclaimed Penelope Clearwater, rising couch. "What happened you, Padma?"  "I," stuttered, "I, I heard - ghost -"  "It Bloody Baron, it?" said Clearwater. She drew wand moment later holding cup, Aguamenti later cup filled water. "Here, drink this, sit -"  Padma already striding toward pentagonal table. She looked Harry Potter, looking gaze, calm grave little sad.  "You this!" Padma said. "How - - dare you!"  There sudden hush Ravenclaw dorm.  Harry looked her.  And said, "Is anything I help with?"  "Don't deny it," Padma said, voice shaking, "you set ghost me, said -"  "I mean it," Harry said. "Can I help anything? Get food, go fetch soda you, help homework, anything like that?"  Everyone staring two them.  "Why?" Padma said. She think anything else say, understand.  "Because us standing precipice," Harry said. "And difference people. Will let help something, Padma, please?"  She stared him, knew, moment, he'd gotten warning, her.  "I..." said. "I've got write six inches lomillialor -"  "Let run dorm room get Herbology stuff," Harry said. He rose pentagonal table, looked Entwhistle Corner. "Sorry, guys, I'll see later."  They say anything, stared, along everyone else dorm room, Harry Potter walked stairs.  And started up, said, "And one's pester questions unless wants talk it, I hope everyone's got that?"  "Got it," said first years older students, sounding quite scared.   And talked lot things Harry Potter besides lomillialor wood - even fear falling back harmony Parvati, she'd never talked anyone before, Harry's ghostly ally already knew. And Harry reached pouch pulled odd books, loaning condition complete secrecy, saying could comprehend books would change pattern thinking enough she'd never fall harmony Parvati again...  At nine o' clock, Harry said go, essay half done.  And Harry paused, looked way out, said thought worthy Slytherin, made feel good whole minute realized said said it.   When Padma got breakfast, morning, saw Mandy see whisper something girl sitting beside Ravenclaw table.  She saw girl get bench walk toward her.  Last night Padma glad girl roomed dorm; thought it, worse, front everyone.  But even though Padma sweating, knew do.  The girl came closer -  "I'm sorry."  "What?" said Padma. That line.  "I'm sorry," repeated Hermione Granger. Her voice loud everyone could hear. "I... I ask Harry that, I angry I found out, I made promise anyone, I'm talking week... I'm really, really sorry, Miss Patil."  Hermione Granger's back stiff, face stiff, could see sweat face.  "Um," said Padma. Her thoughts pretty much scrambled, now...  Padma's gaze flicked Ravenclaw table, one boy watching tight eyes hands clenched lap.   Earlier:  "I told nicer!" shrieked Hermione.  Harry starting sweat. He'd never actually heard Hermione scream before, quite loud empty classroom.  "I - - I nice!" Harry protested. "I practically redeemed her, Padma going wrong path I turned it! I probably changed whole life happier! Besides, heard original version Professor Quirrell suggested I -" point Harry realized saying closed mouth second late.  Hermione clutched chestnut curls, gesture Harry seen before. "What'd say do? Kill her?"  The Defense Professor suggested Harry identify key influential students inside outside year try gain control entire Hogwarts rumor mill, remarking generally useful amusing challenge true Slytherin attending Hogwarts.  "Nothing like that," Harry said quickly, "he said general way I get influence people spreading rumors, I decided nice version would inform Padma directly meaning doing, possible consequences actions, instead trying threaten anything like -"  "You call threatening someone?" Hermione's hands pulling hair now.  "Um..." Harry said. "I guess might've felt little threatened, Hermione, people whatever think get away with, care much hurts people hurt themselves, Padma thinks there's consequences spreading lies course she'll go -"  "And think there's going consequences did?"  Harry got sudden sick feeling stomach.  Hermione angriest look he'd ever seen. "What think students think now, Harry? Of me? If Harry like way talk Hermione, get ghosts set you, want think?"  Harry opened mouth words came out, just... thought way, actually...  Hermione reached grab books table she'd slammed them. "I'm talking week, I'll tell everyone I'm talking week, I'll tell why, maybe undo did. And week, I'll - I'll decide do, I guess -"  "Hermione!" Harry's voice rose shriek desperation. "I trying help!"  The girl turned back looked opened classroom door.  "Harry," said, voice trembled little beneath anger, "Professor Quirrell sucking darkness, really is, I mean it, Harry."  "This... him, said do, -"  Hermione's voice almost whisper now. "Someday going go lunch him, dark side comes back, maybe even come back all."  "I promise you," Harry said, "that I come back lunch."  He even thinking said it.  And Hermione turned around strode slammed door behind her.  Way invoke laws dramatic irony, moron, observed Harry's Internal Critic. Now going die Saturday, last words 'I'm sorry, Hermione', she'll always regret last thing slam door -  Oh, shut up.   When Padma sat Hermione breakfast, said voice loud enough others hear ghost told things important hear, Harry Potter right it, people less frightened afterward, frightened more.  And afterward people say fewer nasty things Hermione, least first year, least public Harry Potter might hear it.  When Professor Flitwick asked Harry responsible happened Padma, Harry said yes, Professor Flitwick told serve two days' detention. Even ghost Padma hurt, still, acceptable behavior Ravenclaw student. Harry nodded said understood Professor that, protest; considering seem turned Padma around, Professor Flitwick really think, record, he'd done wrong thing? And Professor Flitwick paused, seeming actually think it, said Harry, solemnly squeaky voice, needed learn relate students normal way.  And Harry help think advice Professor Quirrell would never give him.  Harry help think he'd done Professor Quirrell's way, normal Slytherin way, mixture positive negative incentives bring Padma rumor-mongers explicit control, Padma talked it, Hermione would never found out...  ...in case Padma redeemed, would stayed wrong path, would suffered eventually. It Harry lied Padma way, Time-Turned invisible using Ventriloquism Charm.  Harry still sure whether he'd done right thing, right thing, Hermione relented talking - though talking lot Padma. It hurt Harry expected, going back studying himself; like brain already started forget long-honed skill alone.  The days Saturday's lunch Professor Quirrell seemed go very, slowly.   Chapter 51: Title Redacted, Pt 1  Saturday.  Harry run trouble falling asleep Friday night, anticipated might happen, decided take obvious advance precaution buying sleeping potion; prevent constituting visible sign nervous, decided buy Fred George couple months earlier. (Be prepared, that's Boy Scout's marching song...)  Thus Harry fully rested, pouch contained almost everything owned might conceivably need. Harry had, fact, run volume limitation pouch; keeping mind would need store large snake, might need store who-knew-what-else, removed bulkier items, like car battery. He point could Transfigure something size car battery four minutes flat, much loss.  Harry kept emergency flares oxyacetylene welding torch fuel tank, since Transfigure things burned.  (Be prepared, life march along...)  Mary's Place.  After waitress taken order bowed left room, Professor Quirrell performed four Charms, they'd talked nothing vast consequence, Professor Quirrell's complex thesis Dark Lord's curse Defense position led decline dueling changed social customs magical Britain. Harry listened nodded said intelligent things, tried control pounding heart.  Then waitress came bearing food, time, minute waitress departed, Professor Quirrell gestured door close lock, began speak twenty-nine security Charms, one ones Mr. Bester's sequence left time, somewhat puzzled Harry.  Professor Quirrell finished Charms -  - stood chair -  - blurred green snake, banded blue white -  - hissed, "Hungry, boy? Eat fill sswiftly, sshall need sstrength time."  Harry's eyes bit wide, hissed, "I ate well breakfasst," rapidly began forking noodles mouth.  The snake watched moment, flat eyes, hissed, "Do wissh explain here. Prefer elssewhere firsst. Need leave unobsserved, without ssign ever departed room."  "Sso one track uss," hissed Harry.  "Yess. Do trusst much, boy? Think ansswer. I important requesst you, requiress trusst; ssay regardlesss, ssay now."  Harry dropped gaze snake's flat eyes, looked back sauce-coated noodles, ate another bite, another, thought.  The Defense Professor... ambiguous figure, put mildly; Harry thought unraveled goals, others remained mysterious.  But Professor Quirrell knocked two hundred girls stop ones summoning Harry. Professor Quirrell deduced Dementor draining Harry wand. The Defense Professor saved Harry's life, twice, two-week period.  Which could mean Defense Professor saving Harry later, ulterior motives. Indeed, certain ulterior motives. Professor Quirrell whim. But Professor Quirrell also seen Harry taught Occlumency, taught Harry lose... Defense Professor wanted make use Harry Potter, use required strengthened Harry Potter, weakened one. That meant used friend, would want use make stronger instead weaker.  And sometimes cold atmosphere Defense Professor, bitterness voice emptiness gaze, Harry one Professor Quirrell allowed see it.  Harry quite know describe words sense kinship felt Professor Quirrell, except say Defense Professor clear-thinking person Harry met wizarding world. Sooner later everyone else started playing Quidditch, putting protective shells time machines, thinking Death friend. It matter good intentions were. Sooner later, usually sooner, demonstrated something deep inside brain confused. Everyone except Professor Quirrell. It bond went beyond anything debts owed, even anything personal liking, two alone wizarding world. And Defense Professor occasionally seemed little scary little Dark, well, thing people said Harry.  "I trusst you," hissed Harry.  And snake explained first stage plan.   Harry took final forkful noodles, chewed. Beside him, Professor Quirrell, human form again, eating soup placidly, though nothing special interest occurring.  Then Harry swallowed, moment stood chair, already feeling heart start hammer hard chest. The security precautions taking literally stringent possible...  "Are ready test it, Mr. Potter?" Professor Quirrell said calmly.  It test, Professor Quirrell say that, loud human speech, even room screened limit Professor Quirrell secured Charms.  "Yep," Harry said casually could.  Step one.  Harry said "Cloak" pouch, drew forth Cloak Invisibility, unstuck pouch belt threw toward side table.  The Defense Professor stood seat, drew wand, bent down, touched wand pouch, murmuring quiet incantation. The new enchantments would ensure Professor Quirrell could enter pouch snakeform, leave own, hear went outside pouch.  Step two.  As Professor Quirrell stood he'd bent pouch, put away wand, wand happened point Harry's direction, brief crawling sensation Harry's chest near Time-Turner lay, like something creepy passed close without touching him.  Step three.  The Defense Professor turned snake again, sense doom diminished; snake crawled pouch it, pouch's mouth opening admit green shape, mouth closed behind tail, sense doom diminished further.  Step four.  Harry drew wand, careful stand still it, Time-Turner would move Professor Quirrell anchored hourglass within shell current orientation. "Wingardium Leviosa," murmured Harry, pouch began float toward him.  Slowly, slowly, Professor Quirrell instructed, pouch began float toward Harry, waited alert sign pouch opening, case Harry use Hover Charm propel away fast possible.  As pouch came within meter Harry, sense doom returned.  As Harry reattached pouch belt, sense doom stronger ever been, still overwhelming; tolerable.  Even Professor Quirrell's Animagus form lying within extended space pouch resting Harry's hip.  Step five.  Harry sheathed wand. His hand still held Cloak Invisibility, Harry drew cloak himself.  Step six.  And room shielded every possible scrying, Professor Quirrell personally secured, Harry wearing true Cloak Invisibility reached beneath shirt twisted outer shell Time-Turner once.  The Time-Turner's inner hourglass stayed anchored motionless, setting twisted around -  The food vanished table, chairs leaped back place, door sprang open.  Mary's Room deserted, been, Professor Quirrell earlier contacted Mary's Place false name inquire whether room would available hour - reserve it, place canceled reservation might noted, inquire.  Step seven.  Staying Cloak Invisibility, Harry left open door. He navigated tiled hallways Mary's Place well-stocked bar greeted new entrants, tended owner, Jake. There people bar, morning proper lunchtime, Harry wait invisibly door several minutes, listening murmur conversation gurgle alcohol, door opened admit huge genial Irishman, Harry slipped silently wake.  Step eight.  Harry walked while. He well away Mary's Place turned Diagon Alley smaller alley, end lay shop dark, windows enchanted blackness.  Step nine.  "Sword fish melon friend," Harry spoke passphrase lock, clicked open.  Within shop also darkness, light open door briefly illuminating show wide, empty room. The furniture shop operated gone bankrupt months ago, according Defense Professor, shop repossessed, yet resold. The walls painted simple white, wooden floor scratched unpolished, single closed door set back wall; showroom, once, showed nothing.  The door clicked shut behind Harry, darkness pitch complete.  Step ten.  Harry took wand said "Lumos", lighting room white glow; took pouch belt (the sense doom growing little sharper grasped fingers) lightly tossed opposite side room (the sense doom fading almost completely). And began take Cloak Invisibility, even voice hissed, "It iss done."  Step eleven.  From pouch poked green head, followed shortly meter-long green body snake slithered out. A moment later, snake blurred Professor Quirrell.  Step twelve.  Harry waited silence Defense Professor recited thirty Charms.  "All right," Professor Quirrell said calmly, finished. "If anyone still watching us now, case doomed, I speak plainly human form. Parseltongue quite suit me, I fear, I neither descendant Salazar true snake."  Harry nodded.  "So, Mr. Potter," said Professor Quirrell. His gaze intent, pale blue eyes dark shadowed white light coming Harry's wand. "We alone unobserved, I important question ask you."  "Go ahead," said Harry, heart starting beat faster.  "What opinion government magical Britain?"  That quite Harry expecting, close enough, Harry said, "Based limited knowledge, I would say Ministry Wizengamot appear stupid, corrupt, evil."  "Correct," Professor Quirrell said. "Do understand I ask?"  Harry took deep breath, looked Professor Quirrell straight eyes, unflinching. Harry finally worked way make amazing deductions scanty evidence know answer advance, guessed answer fully week ago. It needed slight adjustment...  "You invite join secret organization full interesting people like yourself," said Harry, "one whose goals reform overthrow government magical Britain, yes, I'm in."  There slight pause.  "I'm afraid quite I intended direct conversation," said Professor Quirrell. The corners lips twitching slightly. "I merely planned ask help something extremely treasonous illegal."  Darn, thought Harry. Still, Professor Quirrell denied it... "Go on."  "Before I do," said Professor Quirrell. There levity voice, now. "Are open requests, Mr. Potter? I say likely say regardless, must say now. If curiosity impels otherwise, squash it."  "Treasonous illegal bother me," said Harry. "Risks bother stakes would need commensurate, I can't imagine taking risks frivolously."  Professor Quirrell nodded. "I would not. It terrible abuse friendship you, trust placed teaching position Hogwarts -"  "You skip part," Harry said.  The lips twitched again, went flat. "Then I shall skip it. Mr. Potter, sometimes make game lying truths, playing words conceal meanings plain sight. I, too, known find amusing. But I much tell I hope shall day, Mr. Potter, lie it. You lie straight out, without hesitation, without wordplay hints, anyone asks it, foe closest friend. You lie Malfoy, Granger, McGonagall. You speak, always without hesitation, exactly fashion would speak knew nothing, concern honor. That also must be."  There silence, then, time.  That price measured fraction Harry's soul.  "Without telling yet..." said Harry. "Can say need desperate?"  "There someone terrible want help," Professor Quirrell said simply, "and one help you."  There another silence, long one.  "All right," Harry said quietly. "Tell mission."  The dark robes Defense Professor seemed blur shadow wall, cast silhouette blocking white light Harry's wand. "The ordinary Patronus Charm, Mr. Potter, wards Dementor's fear. But Dementors still see it, know there. Only Patronus Charm. It blinds them, blinds them. What I saw beneath cloak even looking direction killed it; though forgotten existence, even died."  Harry nodded. That surprising, confronted Dementor level true existence, beyond anthropomorphism. Death might last enemy, sentient enemy. When humanity wiped smallpox, smallpox fought back.  "Mr. Potter, central branch Gringotts guarded every spell high low goblins know. Even vaults successfully robbed; wizardry do, wizardry undo. And yet one ever escaped Azkaban. No one. For every Charm counter-Charm, every ward bypass. How one ever rescued Azkaban?"  "Because Azkaban something invincible," Harry said. "Something terrible one defeat it."  That keystone perfect security, be, nothing human. It Death guarded Azkaban.  "The Dementors like meals taken away them," Professor Quirrell said. Coldness entered voice, now. "They know anyone tries. There hundred Dementors there, speak guards well. It's simple, Mr. Potter. If powerful wizard Azkaban hard enter, hard leave. So long try take anything belongs Dementors."  "But Dementors invincible," said Harry. He could cast Patronus Charm thought, moment. "Never believe are."  Professor Quirrell's voice quiet. "Do remember like went Dementor, first time, failed?"  "I remember."  And sudden sickening lurch stomach, Harry knew going; seen before.  "There innocent person Azkaban," Professor Quirrell said.  Harry nodded, burning sensation throat, cry.  "The one I speak Imperius Curse," said Defense Professor, dark robes silhouetted greater shadow. "There surer ways break wills Imperius, time torture, Legilimency, rituals I speak. I cannot tell I know this, I know this, cannot hint even you, trust me. But person Azkaban never chose serve Dark Lord, spent years suffering alone terrible cold darkness imaginable, never deserved single minute it."  Harry saw single leap intuition, mouth racing almost ahead thoughts.  There hint, warning, thought -  "A person name Black," Harry said.  There silence. Silence, pale blue eyes stared him.  "Well," said Professor Quirrell while. "So much telling name accepted mission. I would ask whether reading mind, that's flatly impossible."  Harry said nothing, simple enough believed processes modern democracy. The obvious person Azkaban innocent one gotten trial -  "I certainly impressed, Mr. Potter," said Professor Quirrell. His face grave. "But serious matter, way others could make deduction, I must know. So tell me, Mr. Potter. How name Merlin, Atlantis, void stars, guess I talking Bellatrix?"   Chapter 52: The Stanford Prison Experiment, Pt 2  The adrenaline already flowing Harry's veins, heart already hammering chest, darkened bankrupt store. Professor Quirrell finished explaining, one hand, Harry held tiny wooden twig would key. This it, day moment Harry started acting part. His first true adventure, dungeon pierced, evil government defied, maiden distress rescued. Harry frightened, reluctant, instead felt time past time start becoming people read books; begin journey toward always known meant be, hero. To take first step road led Kimball Kinnison Captain Picard Liono Thundera definitely Raistlin Majere. So far Harry's brain knew watching early morning cartoons, grew supposed gain amazing powers save universe, Harry's brain seen adults adopted role model maturation process, Harry much wanted start growing up.  And pattern story called hero lose part innocence, result first adventure; now, least, still-innocent moment, seemed time past time experience pain. Like casting clothes small him; like finally advancing next stage game, stuck eleven years world 3, level 2 Super Mario Brothers.  Harry read enough novels suspect feel enthusiastic afterward, enjoying lasted.  There popping sound something near Harry disappeared, time heroic brooding.  Harry's hand snapped small wooden twig.  A hook yanked motionlessly Harry's abdomen portkey activated, feeling like much harder pull time smaller transports Hogwarts grounds Diagon Alley -  - dropped middle huge roll thunder dying away, lash cold rain whipping across face, water coating Harry's glasses blinding instant, turning world blur even began fall toward raging ocean waves far below.  He arrived high, high, high empty North Sea.  The shock blasting storm almost made Harry let go broomstick Professor Quirrell given him, would good idea. It took nearly full second Harry get wits together bring broomstick back easy swoop.  "I'm here," said unfamiliar voice patch empty air him; low gravelly, voice sallow lanky bearded man Professor Quirrell Polyjuiced Disillusioning broomstick.  "I'm here," Harry said beneath Cloak Invisibility. He used Polyjuice himself. Wearing different body hindered magic, Harry might need little magic him; thus plan called Harry stay invisible nearly times, instead Polyjuicing.  (Neither spoken other's name. You simply use names point illegal mission, even invisibly hovering anonymous patch water North Sea. You simply didn't. It would stupid.)  Carefully keeping grip broomstick one hand, rain wind howled around him, Harry raised wand equally careful grip Imperviused glasses.  Then, lenses clear, Harry looked around.  He surrounded wind rain, might five degrees Celsius lucky; he'd already Warming Charm cast outside February, standing driving cold droplets. Worse snow, rain soaked every exposed surface. The Cloak Invisibility turned invisible, cover you, meant protect rain. Harry's face exposed full force driven water, driving straight neck soaking shirt, also sleeves robes cuffs pants shoes, water took every bit cloth avenue sneak in.  "This way," said Polyjuiced voice, spark green light lit front Harry's broomstick, darted away direction seemed Harry like every direction.  Through blinding rain, Harry followed. He lost sometimes, small green spark, time did, Harry called out, spark would reappear front seconds later.  When Harry caught trick following spark, accelerated, Harry kicked broomstick high gear followed. The rain whipped harder, feeling like Harry imagined must feel get faceful shotgun pellets, glasses stayed clear protected eyes.  It minutes later, broomstick's full speed, Harry caught glimpse huge shadow rain, towering far across waters.  And felt distant, hollow echo emptiness radiating Death waited, washing Harry's mind parting around it, like wave breaking stone. Harry knew enemy time, steel light.  "I already feel Dementors," said gravelly voice Polyjuiced Quirrell. "I expect that, soon."  "Think stars," Harry said, distant rumble thunder. "Don't allow anger you, nothing negative, think stars, feels like forget fall bodilessly space. Hold thought like Occlumency barrier across entire mind. The Dementors trouble reaching past that."  There silence moment, then, "Interesting."  The green spark lifted, Harry inclined broomstick slightly upward follow, even steered fogbank, cloud hovering low waters.  Soon hovering slightly oblique huge three-sided metal building, loomed far below. The triangle steel hollow, solid, building three thick solid walls center. The Aurors guard roomed top level southern side building, Professor Quirrell said, protected Patronus Charms. The legal entrance Azkaban roof southwest corner building. Which two use, course. Instead would use corridor ran directly beneath northern corner building. Professor Quirrell would go first, puncture hole roof wards right northern tip, leaving behind illusion cover gap.  The prisoners kept side building, levels corresponding crimes. And bottom, uttermost center depth Azkaban, lay nest hundred Dementors. Loads dirt occasionally dropped keep level, matter directly exposed Dementors broke mud nothingness...  "Wait one minute," said rough voice, "follow speed, pass care."  "Got it," Harry said lowly.  The spark winked out, Harry began count, one one thousand, two one thousand, three one thousand...  ...sixty one thousand, Harry dived, wind shrieking around dived, toward vast metal structure, toward could feel shadows Death waiting him, draining light radiating emptiness, metal structure grew larger larger. Plain featureless loomed vast grey shape, single raised boxlike structure southwest corner. The north corner simply blank, Professor Quirrell's hole undetectable.  Harry pulled sharply approached north corner, giving safety margin would bothered flying classes, much. As soon he'd come halt, began slowly lower broomstick again, toward looked like solid roof tip north corner.  Descending illusory roof invisible strange experience, Harry found metal corridor lighted dim orange light - which, Harry realized startled glance, coming old-fashioned mantled gas lamp...  ...for magic would fail, drained away time, presence Dementors.  Harry dismounted broom.  The pull emptiness stronger now, parted flowed around Harry without touching him. They distant many, wounds world; Harry could pointed eyes closed.  "Casst Patronuss," hissed snake floor, looking discolored green dim orange light.  The note stress came even Parseltongue. Harry surprised; Professor Quirrell said Animagi Animagus forms much less vulnerable Dementors. (For reason Patronuses animals, Harry assumed.) If Professor Quirrell much trouble snake form, happening human form let use magic...?  Harry's wand already rising hand.  This would beginning.  Even one person, one person could save darkness, even powerful enough yet teleport Azkaban's prisoners safety burn triangular hell bedrock...  Even start, beginning, payment everything Harry meant accomplish life. No waiting, hoping, mere promising, would begin here. Here now.  Harry's wand slashed point Dementors waited far below.  "Expecto Patronum!"  The glowing humanoid figure blazed existence. It sun-bright thing before... probably Harry quite able stop thinking prisoners cells, ones save.  It might best, though. Harry would need keep Patronus going while, might better quite bright.  The Patronus dimmed little further, thought; again, Harry tried put little less strength it, finally brilliant humanoid figure glowing slightly brighter brightest animal Patronus, Harry felt could dim without risking losing entirely.  And then, "It iss sstable," Harry hissed, began feeding broomstick pouch. His wand stayed hand, slight, sustainable flow replaced slight losses Patronus.  The snake blurred form lanky, sallow man, holding Professor Quirrell's wand one hand broomstick other. The lanky man staggered came back existence, went lean wall moment.  "Well done, perhaps trifle slow," murmured gravelly voice. Professor Quirrell's dryness it, even though fit voice, grave look thickly bearded face. "I cannot feel all, now."  A moment later, broomstick went man's robes vanished. Then man's wand rose tapped head, sound like cracking eggshell disappeared more.  Within air blossomed faint green spark, Harry, still enshrouded Cloak Invisibility, followed after.  If watching outside, would seen nothing small green spark drifting air, brilliantly silver humanoid walking it.   They went down, down, down, passing gas lamp gas lamp, occasional huge metal door, descending Azkaban within seemed like utter silence. Professor Quirrell set type barrier could hear went nearby, sounds could pass outward, sounds could reach Harry.  Harry quite able stop mind wondering silence, stop mind giving answer. The answer he'd already known wordless level anticipation prompted futilely try think it.  Somewhere behind huge metal doors, people screaming.  The silver humanoid figure wavered, brightening dimming, every time Harry thought it.  Harry told cast Bubble-Head Charm himself. To prevent smelling anything.  All enthusiasm heroism worn already, Harry known would, taken long even standards, process completed first time passed one metal doors. Every metal door locked huge lock, lock simple unmagical metal stopped first-year Hogwarts student - still wand, still magic, prisoners didn't. Those metal doors doors individual cells, Professor Quirrell said, one opened corridor would group cells. Somehow helped little, thinking door corresponded directly prisoner waiting right behind it. Instead might one prisoner, diminished emotional impact; like study showing people contributed told given amount money required save one child's life, told total amount needed save eight children...  Harry finding increasingly hard think it, every time did, light Patronus fluctuated.  They came place passageway turned left, corner triangular building. Once descending metal steps, another flight stairs; went down.  Mere murderers put lowest cells. There always lower place could go, even worse punishment fear. No matter low already sunk, government magical Britain threat remaining even worse.  But Bellatrix Black Death Eater inspired fear anyone save Lord Voldemort himself, beautiful deadly sorceress absolutely loyal master; been, thing possible, sadistic evil even You-Know-Who, though trying outdo master...  ...that world knew her, world believed her.  But then, Professor Quirrell told Harry, debut Dark Lord's terrible servant, girl Slytherin quiet, keeping mostly herself, harming one. Afterward made-up stories told her, memories changing retrospect (Harry knew well research that). But time, still attended school, talented witch Hogwarts known gentle girl (Professor Quirrell said). Her friends surprised she'd joined Death Eaters, surprised she'd hiding much darkness behind sad, wistful smile.  That Bellatrix been, promising witch generation, Dark Lord stole broke her, shattered reshaped her, binding deeper level darker arts Imperius.  Ten years Bellatrix served Dark Lord, killing bade kill, torturing bade torture.  And Dark Lord finally defeated.  And Bellatrix's nightmare continued.  Somewhere inside Bellatrix might something still screaming, screaming whole time, something psychiatric Healer could bring back; might be, Professor Quirrell way knowing. But either way, could...  ...they could least get Azkaban...  Bellatrix Black put lowest level Azkaban.  Harry trouble imagining would see got cell. Bellatrix must almost fear death, beginning, still alive all.  They descended another flight stairs, coming much closer Death Bellatrix, clacking invisible shoes sound Harry could hear. Dim orange light coming gas lights, faint green spark drifting air, shining figure following silver light fluctuating time time.   After descending many times, came time corridor end stairs, final metal door, green spark halted it.  Harry's heart calmed little, descended far depths Azkaban without anything happening. But hammering chest more. They bottom, shadows Death close hand.  A soft metal click came lock, Professor Quirrell opened way.  Harry took deep breath remembered everything Professor Quirrell told him. The hard part getting pretended personality right enough fool Bellatrix Black herself, hard part would keeping Patronus going time...  The green spark winked out, moment later meter-high snake shimmered existence, longer invisible.  The metal door moved slow creaking sound Harry pushed invisible hand, opened crack, peered through.  He saw straight corridor terminated solid stone. There light crept Harry's Patronus. That bright enough see outer bars eight cells set corridor, see insides; importantly, though, see anyone corridor itself.  "I ssee nothing," hissed Harry.  The snake darted ahead, swiftly twisting across floor.  A moment later -  "Sshe iss alone," hissed snake.  Stay, Harry thought Patronus, took position one side door, though guarding it; Harry pushed door open further, followed within.  The first cell Harry looked contained dessicated corpse, skin gone grey mottled, flesh worn places expose bone beneath, eyes -  Harry shut eyes. He could still that, still invisible, betraying anything shutting eyes.  He'd known already, he'd read page six Transfiguration book, stayed Azkaban prison term done. If died kept released corpse. If term life, left body cell cell needed, point threw body Dementors' pit. But still shock see, corpse person who'd left -  The light room wavered.  Steady, thought Harry core. It good Professor Quirrell Patronus went thinking sad thoughts. This near Dementors Defense Professor might fall dead stood. Steady, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, steady!  With thought, Harry opened eyes again, time waste.  The second cell looked contained skeleton.  And behind bars third cell saw Bellatrix Black.  Something precious irreplaceable inside Harry withered like dry grass.  You could tell woman skeleton, head skull, texture skin still different texture bone, matter white pale she'd become, waiting dark alone. Either feeding much, ate, shadows Death drained her; eyes seemed shrunken lids, lips looked shriveled close teeth. The color seemed leached black clothing worn prison, like Dementors drained too. They'd meant daring, clothes, lay loosely skeleton, exposing shriveled skin.  I'm save her, I'm save her, I'm save her, Harry thought himself, desperately, over effort like Occlumency, willing Patronus go out, stay protect Bellatrix Dementors -  In heart, core, Harry held pity compassion, save darkness; silver radiance coming open door brightened, even thought it.  And another part him, like letting another part mind carry habit without paying much attention it...  A cold expression came Harry's face, invisibly beneath hood.  "Hello, dear Bella," said chill whisper. "Did miss me?"   Chapter 53: The Stanford Prison Experiment, Pt 3  The corpse woman opened eyes, dull sunken orbs gazed nothing.  "Mad," Bellatrix muttered cracked voice, "It seems little Bella going mad..."  Professor Quirrell instructed Harry, calmly precisely, act Bellatrix's presence; form pretense would maintain mind.  You found expedient, perhaps amusing, make Bellatrix fall love you, bind service.  That love would persisted Azkaban, Professor Quirrell said, Bellatrix would happy thought.  She loves utterly, completely, whole being. You return love, consider useful. She knows this.  She deadliest weapon possessed, called dear Bella.  Harry remembered night Dark Lord killed parents: cold amusement, contemptuous laughter, high-pitched voice deathly hate. It seem difficult guess Dark Lord would say.  "I hope mad, Bella dear," said chill whisper. "Mad useful."  Bellatrix's eyes flickered, tried focus empty air.  "My... Lord... I waited come... I looked I could find you... alive..." All words came low mutter, emotion it, Harry could tell.  "Sshow face," hissed snake Harry's feet.  Harry cast back hood Cloak Invisibility.  The part Harry placed control facial expressions looked Bella without slightest trace pity, cool, calm interest. (While core, Harry thought, I save you, I save matter what...)  "The scar..." muttered Bellatrix. "That child..."  "So still think," said Harry's voice, gave thin little chuckle. "You looked wrong place, Bella dear."  (Harry asked Professor Quirrell one play part Dark Lord, Professor Quirrell pointed plausible reason possessed shade He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.)  Bellatrix's eyes remained fixed Harry, said word.  "Ssay ssomething Parsseltongue," hissed snake.  Harry's face turned snake, make clear addressing it, hissed, "One two three four five ssix sseven eight nine ten."  There pause.  "Those fear darkness..." murmured Bellatrix.  The snake hissed, "Will conssumed it."  "Will consumed it," whispered chill voice. Harry particularly want think Professor Quirrell gotten password. His brain, thought anyway, suggested probably involved Death Eater, quiet isolated place, lead-pipe Legilimency.  "Your wand," murmured Bellatrix, "I took Potters' house hid it, lord... tombstone right father's grave... kill me, now, wished me... I think I must always wanted one kill me... I can't remember now, must happy thought..."  Harry's heart wrenched inside him, unbearable, - cry, let Patronus fade -  Harry's face showed flicker annoyance, voice sharp said, "Enough foolishness. You're come me, Bella dear, unless prefer company Dementors."  Bellatrix's face twitched brief puzzlement, shrunken limbs stir.  "You'll need float out," Harry hissed snake. "Sshe longer think esscaping."     "Yess," hissed snake, "but underesstimate her, sshe wass deadliesst warriorss." The green head dipped warning. "One would wisse fear me, boy, even I sstarved nine-tenthss dead; wary her, allow ssingle flaw pretensse."  The green snake smoothly glided door.  And shortly after, man sallow skin fearful expression bearded face cringed room wand hand.  "My Lord?" servant said falteringly.  "Do instructed," Dark Lord whispered chill voice, sounding even terrible coming child's body. "And let Patronus falter. Remember, I return reward you, long family allowed die."  Having spoken dreadful words, Dark Lord pulled invisibility cloak head, disappeared.  The cringing servant opened door Bellatrix's cage, pulled tiny needle robes poked human skeleton. The single drop red blood produced soon absorbed small doll, laid upon floor, servant began chant whisper.  Soon another living skeleton lay upon floor, motionless. Afterward servant seemed hesitate moment, empty air hissed impatient command. Then servant pointed wand Bellatrix spoke word, living skeleton lying bed naked, skeleton lying floor clothed faded dress.  The servant tore small strip cloth dress, lay upon seeming corpse; robes, fearful man produced empty glass flask small traces golden fluid clinging inside. This flask concealed corner, strip skirt laid it, leached cloth nearly blending gray metal wall.  Another wave servant's wand floated human skeleton lying bed air, almost motion clothed new black robes. An ordinary-looking bottle chocolate milk put hand, chill whisper ordered Bellatrix grasp bottle begin drinking it, did, face still looking puzzled.  Then servant turned Bellatrix invisible, turned invisible, left. The door closed behind clicked locked, plunging corridor darkness more, unchanged small flask concealed corner one cell, fresh corpse lying upon floor.   Earlier, deserted shop, Professor Quirrell told Harry going commit perfect crime.  Harry unthinkingly started repeat back standard proverb thing perfect crime, actually thought two-thirds second, remembered wiser proverb, shut mouth midsentence.  What think know, think know it?  If commit perfect crime, nobody would ever find - could anyone possibly know perfect crimes?  And soon looked way, realized perfect crimes probably got committed time, coroner marked death natural causes, newspaper reported shop never profitable finally gone business...  When Bellatrix Black's corpse found dead cell next morning, within prison Azkaban (everyone knew) one ever escaped, nobody bothered autopsy. Nobody thought twice it. They locked corridor left, Daily Prophet reported obituary column next day...  ...that perfect crime Professor Quirrell planned.  And Professor Quirrell screwed up.   Chapter 54: The Stanford Prison Experiment, Pt 4  A faint green spark moved forward set pace, behind followed brilliant silver figure, entities invisible. They traversed five legs corridor, turned right five times gone five flights stairs; Bellatrix finished second bottle chocolate milk, given solid bars chocolate eat.  It third bar chocolate strange noises began come Bellatrix's throat.  It took moment Harry understand, process sounds, sound like anything he'd ever heard before; rhythm shattered, almost unrecognizable, took long realize Bellatrix crying.  Bellatrix Black crying, Dark Lord's terrible weapon crying, invisible could hear it, tiny pathetic sounds trying suppress, even now.  "It's real?" said Bellatrix. Tonality returned voice, longer dead mutter, rose end form question. "It's real?"  Yes, thought part Harry simulating Dark Lord, silent -  He make words pass lips, couldn't.  "I knew - would - come - someday," Bellatrix's voice quavered fractured drew breath quiet sobs, "I knew - alive - would come - - Lord..." long inhalation like huge gasp, "and even - came - still love - never - would never love back - - take - love - even though I can't remember - can't remember many things - though I know I forgot - I remember much I love you, Lord -"  There knife stabbing Harry's heart, he'd never heard anything terrible, wanted hunt Dark Lord kill this...  "Do still - use - Lord?"  "No," hissed Harry's voice, without even thinking, seemed operating automatic, "I entered Azkaban whim. Of course I use you! Don't ask foolish questions."  "But - I'm weak," said Bellatrix's voice, full sob escaped her, sounded much loud corridors Azkaban, "I can't kill you, Lord, I'm sorry, ate all, ate up, I'm weak fight, good I -"  Harry's brain cast desperately way reassure her, lips Dark Lord would never speak single word caring.  "Ugly," said Bellatrix. Her voice said word like final nail coffin, last despair. "I'm ugly, ate too, I'm, I'm pretty more, even, able, use me, reward, servants - even Lestranges, want, hurt me, -"  The brilliant silver figure stopped walking.  Because Harry stopped walking.  The Dark Lord, he... The part Harry's self soft vulnerable screaming disbelieving horror, trying reject reality, refuse understanding, even colder harder part completed pattern: She obeyed obeyed things.  The green spark bobbed urgently, darted forward.  The silver humanoid stayed place.  Bellatrix sobbing harder.  "I'm, I'm not, I can't be, useful, more..."  Giant hands squeezing Harry's chest, wringing like washcloth, trying crush heart.  "Please," whispered Bellatrix, "just kill me..." Her voice seemed calm, said that. "Please Lord, kill me, I've reason live I'm use you... I want stop... please hurt one last time, Lord, hurt I stop... I love you..."  It saddest thing Harry ever heard.  The bright silver shape Harry's Patronus flickered -  Wavered -  Brightened -  The fury rising Harry, rage Dark Lord done this, rage Dementors, Azkaban, world allowed horror, seemed pouring straight arm wand without way blocking it, tried willing stop nothing happened.  "My Lord!" whispered disguised voice Professor Quirrell. "My spell going control! Help me, Lord!"  Brighter Patronus, brighter brighter, waxing faster day Harry destroyed Dementor.  "My Lord!" silhouette said terrified whisper. "Help me! Everyone feel it, Lord!"  Everyone feel it, thought Harry. His imagination could picture clearly, prisoners cells stirring cold darkness fell away, replaced healing light.  Every exposed surface burned like white sun reflections, silhouette Bellatrix's skeleton sallow man clearly visible blaze, Disillusionment spells unable keep pace unearthly brilliance; Cloak Invisibility Deathly Hallows withstood it.  "My Lord! You must stop it!"  But Harry could longer stop, longer wanted stop. He could sense it, more sparks life Azkaban sheltered Patronus, unfolded like spreading wings sunlight, air turned absolute silver thought it, Harry knew do.  "Please, Lord!"  The words went unheard.  They far him, Dementors pit, Harry knew could destroyed even distance light blazed bright enough, knew Death could face stopped holding back, unsealed gates inside sank wells spell deepest parts spirit, mind will, gave absolutely everything spell -  And interior Sun, slightly dimmer shadow moved forward, reaching entreating hand.  WRONG   DON'T  The sudden sense doom clashed Harry's steel determination, dread uncertainty striving bright purpose, nothing else might reached that. The silhouette took another step forward another, sense doom rising point terrible catastrophe; drench cold water, Harry saw it, realized consequences doing, danger trap.  If watching outside would seen interior Sun brightening dimming...  Brightening dimming...  ...and finally fading, fading, fading ordinary moonlight seemed like pitch darkness contrast.  Within darkness moonlight stood sallow man hand outstretched entreaty, skeleton woman, lying upon floor, puzzled look upon face.  And Harry, still invisible, fallen knees. The greater danger passed, Harry trying collapse, keep spell going lower level. He'd drained something, hopefully lost something - known, remembered, mere magic fueled Patronus Charm -  "Thank you, Lord," whispered sallow man.  "Fool," said hard voice boy pretending Dark Lord. "Did I warn spell could prove fatal failed control emotions?"  Professor Quirrell's eyes widen, course.  "Yes, Lord, I understand," said Dark Lord's servant faltering voice, turned Bellatrix -  She already pushing floor, slowly, like old, old Muggle woman. "How funny," Bellatrix whispered, "you almost killed Patronus Charm..." A giggle sounded like blowing dust giggle pipes. "I could punish you, maybe, Lord froze place I knives... maybe I useful all? Oh, I feel little better now, strange..."  "Be silent, dear Bella," Harry said chill voice, "until I give leave speak."  There reply, obedience.  The servant levitated human skeleton, made invisible more, followed shortly disappearance sound another cracking egg.  They passed corridors Azkaban.  And Harry knew passed, prisoners stirring cells fear lifted one precious moment, maybe even feeling small touch healing light passed by, collapsing cold darkness pressed back in.  Harry trying hard think it.  Otherwise Patronus would wax burned away every Dementor Azkaban, blazing bright enough destroy even distance...  Otherwise Patronus would wax burned away every Dementor Azkaban, taking Harry's life fuel.   In Auror's quarters top Azkaban, one Auror trio snoring barracks, one Auror trio resting breakroom, one Auror trio duty command room, keeping watch. The command room simple large, three chairs back three Aurors sat, wands always hand sustain three Patronuses, bright white forms paced front open window, sheltering Dementors' fear.  The three usually stuck back, played poker, look window. You could seen sky there, sure, even hour two every day could've seen sun, window also looked central pit hell.  Just case Dementor wanted float talk you.  There way Auror Li would agreed serve duty here, triple pay triple pay, family support. (His real name Xiaoguang, everyone called Mike instead; he'd named children Su Kao, hopefully would serve better.) His consolation, besides money, least mates played excellent game Dragon Poker. Though would hard to, point.  It 5,366th game Li would probably best hand 5300s. It Saturday February three players, let shift suit one hole card except two, three, seven; enough let build Corps-a-Corps Unicorns, Dragons, sevens...  Across table him, Gerard McCusker looked table cards toward direction window, staring.  The sinking feeling came Li's stomach surprising speed.  If seven hearts got hit Dementor Modifier turned six, going straight two pair McCusker might beat -  "Mike," said McCusker, "what's Patronus?"  Li turned head looked.  His soft silver badger turned away watch pit staring downward something could see.  A moment later, Bahry's moonlit duck McCusker's bright anteater followed suit, staring downward direction.  They exchanged glances, sighed.  "I'll tell them," said Bahry. Protocol called sending three Aurors off-duty sleeping investigate anything anomalous. "Maybe relieve one take C spiral, two mind."  Li exchanged glance McCusker, nodded. It hard break Azkaban, wealthy enough hire powerful wizard, well-intentioned enough recruit someone could cast Patronus Charm. People friends Azkaban would that, break give someone half-day's worth Patronus time, chance real dreams instead nightmares. Leave supply chocolate conceal cell, increase chance lived sentence. And Aurors guard... well, even got caught, could probably convince Aurors overlook it, exchange right bribe.  For Li, right bribe tended range two Knuts silver Sickle. He hated place.  But Bahry One-Hand wife wife healer's bills, could afford hire someone could break Azkaban, could afford grease Bahry's remaining palm pretty hard, one caught you.  By unspoken agreement, none giving anything away first propose it, three finished poker hand first. Li won, since Dementors actually shown up. And Patronuses stopped staring gone back normal patrol, probably nothing, procedure procedure.  After Li raked pot, Bahry gave formal nods, stood table. The older man's long white locks brushed fancy red robes, robes brushed metal floor command room, Bahry went separating door led formerly off-duty Aurors.  Li Sorted Hufflepuff, sometimes felt little queasy kind business. But Bahry shown pictures, let man could poor sick wife, especially seven months left retirement.   The faint green spark floated metal corridors, silver humanoid, seeming little dimmer now, followed it. Sometimes bright figure would flare, especially passed one huge metal doors, always died back again.  Mere eyes could seen invisible others: eleven-year-old Boy-Who-Lived, living skeleton Bellatrix Black, Polyjuiced Defense Professor Hogwarts, traveling together Azkaban. If beginning joke, Harry know punchline.  They'd gone another four flights stairs rough voice Defense Professor said, simply without emphasis, "Auror coming."  It took long, whole second maybe, Harry understand, jolt adrenaline pump blood, remember Professor Quirrell already discussed told case, Harry spun heel flew back way they'd come.  Harry reached flight stairs, frantically laid third step top, cold metal feeling hard even cloak robes. Trying move head up, peer lip stairs, showed see Professor Quirrell; meant Harry line stray fire.  His shining Patronus followed him, lay beside step beneath him; must seen.  There faint sound wind whooshing, sound Bellatrix's invisible body coming rest stair below, place except -  "Stay still," said cold high whisper, "stay silent."  There stillness, silence.  Harry pressed wand side metal step him. If anyone else would needed take Knut pocket... rip bit cloth robe... bite one nails... find speck rock large enough could see solid enough stay one place orientation touched wand. But Harry's almighty power partial Transfiguration, necessary; could skip particular step operation use material near hand.  Thirty seconds later Harry proud new owner curved mirror, and...  "Wingardium Leviosa," Harry whispered quietly could.  ...was levitating steps, watching, curved surface, almost whole corridor Professor Quirrell invisibly waited.  Harry heard distance, then, sound footsteps.  And saw form (a little hard see mirror) person red robes, coming stairs, entering seemingly empty corridor; accompanied small Patronus animal Harry quite make out.  The Auror protected blue shimmer, hard see details Harry could see much, Auror shields already raised strengthened.  Crap, thought Harry. According Defense Professor, essential art dueling consisted trying put defenses would block whatever someone likely throw you, trying turn attack ways likely go past current set defenses. And far easiest way win sort real fight - Professor Quirrell said over - shoot enemy raised shield first place, either behind close enough range dodge counter time.  Though Professor Quirrell might still able get shot behind, -  But Auror halted taking three steps corridor.  "Nice Disillusionment," said hard male voice Harry recognize. "Now show yourself, real trouble."  The form sallow, bearded man became visible then.  "And Patronus," said hard voice. "Come too. Now."  "Wouldn't smart," said gravelly voice sallow man. It longer terrified voice Dark Lord's servant; suddenly become professional intimidation competent criminal. "You want see who's behind me. Trust me, don't. Five hundred Galleons, cold cash front, turn around walk away. Big trouble career don't."  There long pause.  "Look, whoever are," said hard voice. "You seem confused works. I care that's Lucius Malfoy behind Albus bloody Dumbledore. You come out, I scan whole lot you, talk much going cost -"  "Two thousand Galleons, final offer," said gravelly voice, taking warning undertone. "That's ten times going rate make year. And believe me, see something shouldn't, going regret taking -"  "Shut it!" said hard voice. "You've got exactly five seconds drop wand I drop you. Five, four -"  What doing, Professor Quirrell? Harry thought frantically. Attack first! Cast shield least!  "- three, two, one! Stupefy!"   Bahry stared, chill running spine.  The man's wand moved fast like Apparated place, Bahry's stunner currently sparkling tamely end it, blocked, countered, deflected, caught like fly honey.  "My offer gone back five hundred Galleons," said man colder, formal voice. He smiled dryly, smile looked wrong bearded face. "And shall need accept Memory Charm."  Bahry already swapped harmonics shields stunner pass back through, already tilted wand back defensive position, already raised hardened artificial hand position block anything blockable, already thinking wordless spells put layers shields -  The man looking Bahry. Instead poking curiously Bahry's stunner still wavered end wand, drawing red sparks flicking away fingers, slowly disassembling hex like child's rod puzzle.  The man raised shields own.  "Tell me," man said disinterested voice seem quite fit rough throat - Polyjuice, Bahry would called it, he'd thought anyone could possibly magic delicate inside someone else's body - "what last war? Put harm's way, stay trouble?"  "Harm's way," said Bahry. His voice kept iron calm Auror nearly hundred full years force, seven months short mandatory retirement, Mad-Eye Moody said hardness.  "Fight Death Eaters?"  Now grim smile graced Bahry's face. "Two once." Two You-Know-Who's warrior-assassins, personally trained dark master. Two Death Eaters Bahry alone. It toughest fight Bahry's life, he'd stood ground, walked away loss left hand.  "Did kill them?" The man sounded idly curious, continued draw threads fire much-diminished stunbolt still captive end wand, fingers weaving small patterns Bahry's magic flicking disperse them.  Sweat broke Bahry's skin beneath robes. His metal hand flashed downward, ripped mirror belt - "Bahry Mike, I need backup!"  There pause, silence.  "Bahry Mike!"  The mirror lay dull lifeless hand. Slowly, Bahry put back belt.  "It's quite since I serious fight serious opponent," man said, still looking Bahry. "Try disappoint much. You attack whenever ready. Or walk away five hundred Galleons."  There long silence.  Then air screamed like metal cutting glass Bahry slashed wand downward.   Harry could hardly see it, could hardly make anything amid lights flashes, mirror's curve perfect (they'd practiced tactic Chaos Legion) scene still small, Harry feeling able understand even watching meter away, happening fast, red blasts deflecting blue shields, green bars light clashing together, shadowy forms appearing vanishing, even tell casting what, except Auror shouting incantation incantation frantically dodging Professor Quirrell's Polyjuiced form stood one place flicked wand, mostly silently, pronouncing words unrecognizable languages would white whole mirror show half Auror's shielding torn away staggered back.  Harry seen exhibition duels strongest seventh-year students, far Harry's mind felt numbed, looking far left go. There single seventh-year student could lasted half minute Auror, three seventh-year armies put together might able scratch Defense Professor...  The Auror fallen ground, one knee one hand supporting hand gestured frantically mouth shouted desperate words, incantations Harry recognized shield spells, flock shadows spun around Auror like whirlwind razors.  And Harry saw Professor Quirrell's Polyjuiced form deliberately point wand Auror kneeled fought last moments battle.  "Surrender," said gravelly voice.  The Auror spat something unspeakable.  "In case," said voice, "Avada -"  Time seemed move slowly, like time hear individual syllables, Ke, Da, Vra, time watch Auror starting throw desperately aside; even though happening slowly, somehow time anything, time Harry open lips scream NO, time move, maybe even time think.  Only time one desperate wish innocent man die -  And blazing silver figure stood Auror.  Stood fraction second green light struck home.   Bahry twisting frantically aside, knowing going make -  His eyes focused opponent onrushing death, Bahry briefly saw outline brilliant silhouette, Patronus brighter he'd ever seen, saw barely long enough recognize impossible shape, green silver light collided lights vanished, lights vanished, Killing Curse blocked, Bahry's ears pierced saw terrible opponent screaming, screaming, screaming, clutching head screaming, starting fall Bahry already falling -  Bahry hit ground, falling frantic lunge, dislocated left shoulder broken rib screamed protest. Bahry ignored pain, managed scramble back knees, brought wand stun opponent, understand happening knew chance.  "Stupefy!"  The red bolt struck toward man's falling body, torn apart midair dissipated - shield. Bahry could see it, wavering air surrounded fallen screaming opponent.  Bahry could feel like deadly pressure skin, flux magic building building building toward terrible breaking point. His instincts screamed run explosion came, Charm, Curse, wizardry run wild, Bahry could even finish getting feet -  The man threw wand away (he threw away wand!) second later, form blurred vanished entirely.  A green snake lay motionless ground, unmoving even Bahry's next stunner spell, fired sheer reflex, hit without resistance.  As dreadful flux pressure began dissipate, wild wizardry died back down, Bahry's dazed mind noticed scream continuing. Only sounded different, like scream young boy, coming stairs leading next lower level.  That scream choked too, silence except Bahry's frantic panting.  His thoughts slow, confused, disarrayed. His opponent insanely powerful, duel, like first year trainee Auror trying fight Madam Tarma. The Death-Eaters tenth good, Mad-Eye Moody good... who, what, name Merlin's balls anyone blocked Killing Curse?  Bahry managed summon energy press wand rib, mutter healing spell, press shoulder. It took have, took far much him, magic within bare breath utter exhaustion; anything left minor cuts bruises even reinforce scraps left shielding. It could let Patronus go out.  Bahry breathed deeply, heavily, steadied breath much could spoke.  "You," Bahry said. "Whoever are. Come out."  There silence, occurred Bahry whoever might unconscious. He understand happened, he'd heard scream...  Well, one way test that.  "Come out," said Bahry, making voice harder, "or I start using area-effect curses." He probably managed one he'd tried.  "Wait," said boy's voice, young boy's voice, high thin wavering, like someone holding back exhaustion tears. The voice seemed coming closer hand. "Please wait. I'm - coming -"  "Drop invisibility," growled Bahry. He tired bother anti-Disillusionment Charms.  A moment later, young boy's face emerged within unfolding invisibility cloak, Bahry saw black hair, green eyes, glasses, angry red lightning-bolt scar.  If he'd twenty fewer years experience belt might blinked. Instead spat something probably ought say front Boy-Who-Lived.  "He, he," boy's wavering voice said, young face looked frightened exhausted tears still trickling cheeks, "he kidnapped me, make cast Patronus... said he'd kill I didn't... I let kill you..."  Bahry's mind still dazed, things slowly starting click place.  Harry Potter, wizard ever survive Killing Curse. Bahry might able dodge green death, he'd certainly trying, matter came Wizengamot, they'd rule life debt Noble House.  "I see," Bahry said much gentler growl. He started walk toward boy. "Son, I'm sorry through, I need drop cloak drop wand."  The rest Harry Potter emerged invisibility, showing sweat-soaked blue-trimmed Hogwarts robes, right hand clutching eleven-inch holly wand hard knuckles white.  "Your wand," Bahry repeated.  "Sorry," whispered eleven-year-old boy, "here," held wand toward Bahry.  Bahry barely stopped snarling traumatized boy who'd saved life. Instead overrode impulse sigh, stretched hand take wand. "Look, son, really supposed point wand -"  The wand's end twisted lightly beneath Bahry's hand boy whispered, "Somnium."   Harry stared Auror's crumpled body, sense triumph, crushing sense despair.  (Even might late.)  Harry turned look green snake lay motionless.  "Teacher?" hissed Harry. "Friend? Pleasse, alive?" An awful fear taking hold Harry's heart; moment entirely forgotten he'd seen Defense Professor try kill police officer.  Harry pointed wand snake, lips even began shape word Innervate, brain caught screamed him.  He dare use magic Professor Quirrell.  Harry felt it, burning, tearing pain head, like brain split half. He'd felt it, magic Professor Quirrell's magic, matched anti-harmonized fulfillment doom. That mysterious terrible thing would happen Harry Professor Quirrell ever got close other, ever cast magic other, spells ever touched, magic would resonate control -  Harry stared snake, tell breathing.  (The last seconds ticked away.)  He turned stare Auror, seen Boy-Who-Lived, knew.  The full magnitude disaster crushed Harry like thousand hundred-ton weights, he'd managed stun Auror nothing left do, way recover, mission failed, everything failed, failed.  Shocked, dismayed, despairing, think it, see obvious, remember hopeless feelings coming from, realize still needed recast True Patronus Charm.  (And already late.)   Auror Li Auror McCusker rearranged chairs around table, saw time, naked, skeletally thin horror rising hover outside window, headache already hitting seeing it.  They heard voice, like long-dead corpse spoken words words aged died.  The Dementor's speech hurt ears said, "Bellatrix Black cell."  There split second horrified silence, Li tore chair, heading communicator call reinforcements Ministry, even McCusker grabbed mirror started frantically trying raise three Aurors who'd gone patrol.   Chapter 55: The Stanford Prison Experiment, Pt 5  In scarred ruined corridor, lit dim gas lights, boy slowly crept forward, one hand stretched out, toward unmoving snake body teacher.  Harry meter away snake's body first felt it, tickling edge perception.  Ever weakly, sense doom...  Professor Quirrell alive, then.  The thought engendered feeling joy, sort empty despair.  Harry would still caught soon, matter tried explain, still look good. No one would trust again, would think next Dark Lord, help came time fight Lord Voldemort, Hermione would give him, probably even Dumbledore would look another hero...  ...maybe they'd send home parents.  He failed.  Harry looked crumpled body police officer he'd stunned, already-drying blood minor cuts slashes, burned places intricately embroidered red robes.  He'd stupid. He stunned police officer, stayed original story kidnapped Professor Quirrell...  It might late, whispered voice inside him. You might still able fix mistake. The Auror saw you, remembers stunned him... dead, Professor Quirrell dead, Bellatrix dead, would one contradict story.  Slowly, Harry's hand started rise, pointing wand police officer -  Harry's hand halted.  He distant sense behaving uncharacteristically himself, somehow. Like something he'd forgotten, something important, trouble remembering was, exactly.  Oh. That right. He someone believed value human life.  A sense puzzlement accompanied thought, quite remember people's lives seemed valuable...  All right, said logical part him, mind changed now?  Because Azkaban...  And he'd forgotten recast Patronus Charm...  Doing anything all, somehow, seemed like tremendous effort, like thought action weight heavy lift; seem like good idea recast Patronus Charm, still able afraid Dementors. And though remember like happy, knew it.  Harry's hand rose hold wand level him, fingers took starting positions.  And Harry paused.  He couldn't... quite remember... he'd used happy thought.  That odd, something important, really ought able remember it... something death? But happy...  His body shivering, Azkaban seemed cold before, seemed getting colder even thought. It late him, he'd already sunk far, he'd never able cast Patronus Charm -  That may Dementation talking rather accurate estimate, observed logical part himself, habits encoded sheer reflex, requiring energy activate. Think Dementors' fear cognitive bias, try overcome way would overcome cognitive bias. Your hopeless feelings may indicate situation actually hopeless. It may indicate presence Dementors. All negative emotions pessimistic estimates must considered suspect, fallacious proven valid.  (If watching boy thought, would seen distant, abstract, puzzled frown move across face, glasses lightning-bolt scar. His hand stayed starting position Patronus Charm, move.)  The presence Dementors interferes part processes happiness. If cannot retrieve happy thought mnemonic association key happiness, perhaps get memory way instead. When last time talked someone Patronus Charm?  Harry seem remember either.  A crushing wave despair swept him, dismissed logical part untrustworthy, external, not-Harry, dull weight still pressed mind went thinking, take much effort think...  When last time talked someone Dementors?  Professor Quirrell said already able feel presence Dementors, Harry said Professor Quirrell... he'd told Professor Quirrell...  ...to hold memory stars, falling bodilessly space, like Occlumency barrier across entire mind.  His second Defense class year, Friday, Professor Quirrell shown stars, Christmas.  It take much effort remember them, searing points white perfect blackness.  Harry remembered great cloudy wash Milky Way.  Harry remembered peace.  Some coldness fringes limbs seemed retreat.  There words spoken loud day he'd first cast Patronus Charm, mind could remember sounds speech even feelings seemed distant...  ...I thought absolute rejection death natural order.  You cast True Patronus Charm thinking value human life.  ...But lives still alive fought for. Your life, life, Hermione Granger's life, lives Earth, lives beyond, defended protected.  Then idea killing everyone... true self, Dementation talking...  Despair Dementors' influence.  Where there's life, there's hope. The Auror still alive. Professor Quirrell still alive. Bellatrix still alive. I'm still alive. No one's actually died yet...  Harry could picture Earth, now, midst starfield, blue-white orb.  ...and I let them!  "Expecto Patronum!"  The words came little halting, human shape burst back existence dim first, moonlight instead sunlight, white instead silver.  But strengthened, slowly, Harry breathed deliberate rhythm, recovering. Letting light drive back darkness mind. Remembering things almost forgotten, channeling back Patronus Charm.  Even light blazed full silver more, illuminating corridor brightly gas lamps, banishing fully cold, Harry's limbs still shook. That close.  Harry took deep breath. All right. It time reconsider situation thoughts longer artificially darkened Dementors.  Harry reviewed situation.  ...still looked pretty hopeless, actually.  It crushing despair before, Harry still felt wobbly, put mildly. He dare go dark dark side ability take level problem stride. It dark side would laughed scornfully concept giving he'd lost Professor Quirrell marooned depths Azkaban seen police officer. The ordinary Harry able take sort thing stride.  But option except keep moving forward anyway. You get pointless giving actually lost.  Harry looked around.  Dim gas lights lit corridor grey metal, whose sides floor ceiling slashed places, gouged melted, telling anyone cared look battle here.  Professor Quirrell could repaired easily enough, he'd...  The sense betrayal struck Harry full force, then.  Why... he... why...  Because he's evil, said Gryffindor Hufflepuff, quietly sadly. We told so.  No! thought Harry desperately. No, make sense, going commit perfect crime, Auror could Obliviated, corridor repaired, late would BEEN late he'd died!  But Professor Quirrell never really planning commit perfect crime, said grim voice Slytherin. He wanted crime noticed. He wanted everyone know someone killed Auror broken Bellatrix Black Azkaban. He would prepared kind evidence, proof could reveal involvement, use blackmail you; would bound forever.  Harry's Patronus almost went out, then.  No... Harry thought.  Yes, said three parts sadly.  No. It still make sense. Professor Quirrell know I would turn instant I saw kill Auror. That I might well go ahead confess Dumbledore, hoping plead true fact I tricked. And... terms blackmail, killing Auror will, really add much breaking Bellatrix Azkaban willing help? It would cunning keep evidence involvement basic crime, still pretend ally long could, saving blackmail use became necessary...  Rationalization, said Slytherin. So Professor Quirrell it, then?  And Harry thought tinge desperation - knowing, even thought it, motivated part desire reject reality, technique meant wielded - I notice I confused.  There internal silence. None parts seemed anything add that.  And Harry continued take stock moderately hopeless-looking situation.  Did Harry need re-evaluate probability Bellatrix evil?  ...not mission-relevant sense. It given Bellatrix currently evil. Whether innocent who'd made way torture Legilimency unspeakable rituals, whether she'd chosen will, much bearing current situation. The key fact Bellatrix thought Harry Dark Lord, would obey him.  That one resource, then. But Bellatrix starved nine-tenths dead...  'Oh, I feel little better now, strange...'  Bellatrix said that, shattered voice, Harry's Patronus blazed control.  Harry thought, quite said thought this, might mind making things up, but... seemed likely Dementors taken long ago lost forever. But Dementors taken recently, True Patronus Charm might give back. Like difference emptying cup, unused cup fading away. Bellatrix, then, might got back she'd lost last week so. Not happy memories, would eaten years ago. But whatever strength magic drained last week, might regained. Like equivalent getting week rest, week build magic again...  Harry looked Professor Quirrell's snake form.  ...maybe enough Innervate.  If awakening Professor Quirrell was, fact, smart thing do.  Some despair came back Harry, then. He trust Professor Quirrell, trust reviving would wise, happened.  Steady, Harry thought himself, looked crumpled form Auror.  Bellatrix might also able manage Memory Charm.  That could step one, anyway. It exactly getting everyone safely Azkaban, Aurors would know afterward something strange happened, might suspect Bellatrix's body perform autopsy. But step.  ...and would hard get Azkaban? If could get top Azkaban quickly enough, Auror supposed report back in, anyone noticed missing, could fly hole Professor Quirrell made, get far enough away Azkaban activate portkey Harry already possession. (Both Professor Quirrell Harry portkeys, powerful enough transport two humans, plus minus snake. As doubly-concealed departure Mary's Room, Professor Quirrell put enough safety margin plans impress even Harry.)  Bellatrix could carry Professor Quirrell's snake form, Harry dared touch levitate.  Harry turned strode quickly toward Bellatrix waiting stairs. He could feel spirits reviving little. It starting look like good plan, time waste going it.  What Professor Quirrell, matter Bellatrix, portkey took supposed hand Bellatrix psychiatric healer... well, Harry could work along way. Harry would probably bamboozle healer something - going take one hell bamboozling, Harry even sure wanted done - Bellatrix get moving now.  The main problem Harry saw, quickly ran whole process forward imagination, would come reached roof. Professor Quirrell supposed sneak around invisibly Confund monitors would notice visitors aerial surroundings Azkaban, causing see repeating loop scenery minutes. Professor Quirrell said Disillusion Harry's Patronus; switched Patronus, Dementors would notice Bellatrix missing, alert Aurors...  Harry's train thought stumbled.  There times 'Aw, crap' seem cover it.   Li's hands sure despite adrenaline, unlocked bars Vanishing Cabinet linked Azkaban well-guarded room interior Department Magical Law Enforcement. (A one-way Vanishing Cabinet, course. The wards permitted fast ways Azkaban, highly restricted, fast ways out.)  Li stepped well back, pointed wand Cabinet, spoke incantation "Harmonia Nectere Passus", second later -  The door Cabinet burst open bang, room strode heavy-set, square-jawed witch greyed hair cropped close around head. She wore rank signs wore jewelry ornamentation, ordinary Auror's robes deemed fit grace herself: Director Amelia Bones, head Department Magical Law Enforcement said witch DMLE could take Mad-Eye Moody fair fight (not either two sort fight fairly). Li heard rumors Amelia could Apparate within bounds DMLE, sort thing gave rise rumors like that, he'd called alarm fifty seconds ago.  "Get air, now!" Amelia barked shoulder female Auror trio following behind police broomsticks, must crushed there, waiting Li activate Cabinet. "I want aerial coverage place! And make sure keep anti-Disillusionment Charms!" Then head turned toward him. "Report, Auror Li! Do know got yet?"  Another Auror trio holding broomsticks materialized Vanishing Cabinet strode even Li began talking.  They followed trio Hit Wizards full battle gear.  Then another trio Hit Wizards.  Then another broomstick team.   The emaciated form Bellatrix Black resting motionless stairs Harry got there, eyes closed, Harry asked cold, high whisper whether awake, got response.  A brief twitch panic countered thought Professor Quirrell knocked prevent hearing Dark Lord's cringing servant suddenly turn hardened criminal expert battlemage. Which good, heard Harry's voice saying 'Expecto Patronum'.  Harry drew back hood Cloak, pointed wand Bellatrix, whispered gently could, "Innervate."  From way Bellatrix's body jerked little, Harry think he'd managed get quite gentle enough.  The sunken dark eyes opened.  "Bella dear," Harry said cold, high voice, "I afraid we've run bit problem. Have recovered enough small magics?"  There pause, Bellatrix's pale head nodded.  "Very good," Harry said dryly. "I ask walk unaided, Bella dear, I afraid must walk." He pointed wand her. "Wingardium Leviosa."  Harry kept flow force something could sustain while, still probably lifting two-thirds current body weight. She was... thin.  Slowly, though first time years, Bellatrix Black pushed feet.   Amelia strode duty room, Auror Li silver badger following behind her. She'd spun Time-Turner moment she'd heard alarm, spent tense hour preparing forces entry. You loop time within Azkaban itself, Azkaban's future interact past, able arrive DMLE gotten message, arrived time...  Her eyes went straight corpse, uncloaked looking dead, floating beyond viewing window.  "Where Bellatrix Black?" Amelia demanded, showing fear creature fear.  Even blood froze instant, corpse parted lips, gurgled, "Do know."   Harry watched, fully invisible more, Bellatrix slowly leaned down, took Professor Quirrell's wand (which Harry dared touch), slowly straightened again.  Then Bellatrix pointed wand snake, said, voice precise though still whisper, "Innervate."  The snake stir.  "Shall I try again, Lord?" whispered.  "No," Harry said. He swallowed sick feeling. Harry decided say hell try revive Professor Quirrell he'd realized Dementors probably alerted Aurors now. His high, cold voice went on, unperturbed, "Do think able perform Memory Charm, dear Bella?"  Bellatrix paused, said, hesitantly, "I think so, Lord."  "Eliminate Auror's last half-hour memory," Harry commanded. He'd thought bit whether wanted provide justification that, would say Bellatrix asked killing him, case Harry would explain pretending different power group tell shut -  But Bellatrix simply pointed wand Auror, stood silently time, finally whispered, "Obliviate."  She swayed, then, fall.  "Very good, dear Bella," Harry said, chuckled thinly. "And I ask carry snake."  Again, woman said nothing, demanded explanations, ask Harry apparently-invisible Patronus caster it. She staggered long snake lay, slowly bent over, picked up, draped shoulder.  (A tiny little part Harry observed relaxing minion would follow orders unquestioningly, even got far thinking could totally get used minion like Bellatrix, mind-fraction screamed silence mortally offended remainder.)  "Follow," boy commanded minion, began walk.   It starting get crowded duty room, almost crowded breathe, though still space around Amelia herself; needing breathe meant crowd Director Bones, better breathe.  Amelia looked Ora fiddling Auror McCusker's mirror. "Specialist Weinbach," barked, causing young witch start. "Any response One-Hand's mirror?"  "None," Ora said nervously, "it's... I mean jammed, dead, carefully jammed set alarms, line blank mirror might well broken..."  Amelia let expression change, though part already mourning One-Hand got little sadder lot angry. Seven months, he'd seven months left retirement full century service. She remembered eager young Auror, long ago, whole career he'd served DMLE perfect loyalty, least came anything really important...  Someone would burn this.  The Dementor still hovered outside window, casting useless shadow dread operations; creature could gurgle lack knowledge fail reply all, asked questions like 'Did Bellatrix Black escape?' 'Why can't find her?' 'How hidden?' Amelia starting worry criminals already gone, -  "We found hole roof C spiral!" someone shouted doorway. "Still open, ward circumventions still active!"  Amelia's lips peeled back smile like wolf opening jaws eat.  Bellatrix Black still Azkaban.  And Azkaban, Bellatrix Black would remain forever.  She took stride toward window, ignoring Dementor now, looked sky above, check eyes patrolling broomsticks. She see whole sky here, saw ten brooms go past patrol pattern already ought enough catch anyone, though fully meant put every broom could air. Her Aurors equipped fastest racing broom currently market, Nimbus 2000; unsuccessful chases people.  Amelia turned back window, frowned. The room getting ridiculously crowded, two thirds people need here, wanted close center action. If one thing Amelia tolerate, people wanted instead needed.  "All right, lot!" Amelia bellowed them. "Stop hanging around start securing top level spiral! That's right," said looks surprise, "all three! They could tunnel floor ceiling go them, case worked out! We're going level level catch them! I'll take C spiral, Scrimgeour, B..." She paused, then, remembering Mad-Eye retired last year, could she... "Shacklebolt, A spiral, take strongest fighters! Check every set cells pass, look blankets, full set detection Charms every corridor! Nobody leaves Azkaban criminals caught, nobody! And..." People looked Amelia surprise voice trailed off.  The criminals invented way prevent Dementors finding Bellatrix Black.  That ought impossible.  It chilled blood, contemplating that. It like...  Amelia took deep breath, spoke more, voice steel command. "And catch them, make bloody sure they're real criminals people forced take Polyjuice. Anyone behaves oddly, check Imperius Curse. Keep sight times. Don't assume Auror uniform friendly recognize face." She turned communications specialist. "Tell broomsticks. If one brooms peels reason, half hunt rest keep patrolling. And change harmonics everything changeable, may stolen keys." Then back rest room. "No Auror suspicion unless family left threaten."  She saw it, cold looks came older faces, saw younger Aurors flinch, knew understood.  But said loud, sure.  "We're fighting old Wizarding War today, everyone. Just You-Know-Who dead mean Death Eaters forgotten tricks. Now go!"   Harry walked silence gas-lit grey corridor, invisible beside Bellatrix silver shape following them, trying think better plan.  At first, he'd realized Aurors probably knew already, moreover, Professor Quirrell waking up...  His thoughts frozen there, second.  And stayed frozen, even he'd gotten Bellatrix heading downward, buy much time possible; Aurors, Harry figured, would start top move level level. The Aurors could afford move slowly securely; knew prey way out.  Harry able think way out.  Until Harry said himself, well, war game, would General Chaos do?  From answer followed instantly.  And Harry thought, easy, anyone broken Azkaban before?  And he'd realized possible problem: Fine, would General Chaos that?  Whereupon General Chaos come amendment first plan.  It was...  It insanely Gryffindor thing Harry ever...  So trying think better plan, much luck.  Picky picky picky, said Gryffindor. Who complaining plan one minute earlier? You glad came anything all, Mister Now-We're-Doomed.  "My Lord," Bellatrix whispered haltingly, navigated next flight stairs downward, "am I going back cell, Lord?"  Harry's brain distracted, took long process words, another moment process horror, Bellatrix continued speaking.  "I would... please, Lord, I would much rather die," voice said. And then, smaller voice, whisper barely there, "but I go back ask me, Lord..."  "We going back cell," hissed Harry's voice, automatic. Nothing felt allowed reach face.  Um... said Hufflepuff. Did seriously think, 'You ought work me, I would appreciate you?'  A stone would respond kind loyalty, Harry thought. Even I'm getting mistake, I can't help -  She's Dark Lord's loyal killer torturer, supposed reason loyal innocent girl broken pieces used raw material make her, said Hufflepuff. Did forget?  If someone shows much loyalty, even mistake, there's part can't help feel something. The Dark Lord must been... evil seem like strong enough word, must empty... appreciate loyalty, artificial not.  The better parts Harry much say that.  And Harry heard it.  It faint, grew louder every step took forward.  A woman's voice, distant, indistinct.  His ears, automatically, strained make words.  "...please don't..."  "...didn't mean..."  "...don't die..."  Then brain knew hearing, almost moment, figured hearing.  Because Professor Quirrell keep silence more, Azkaban not, fact, silent.  Faint woman's voice, repeating:  "No, I mean it, please die!"  "No, I mean it, please die!"  It got louder every step Harry took, could hear emotion words now, horror, remorse, desperation of...  "No, I mean it, please die!"  ...the woman's worst memory, rehearsing over again...  "No, I mean it, please die!"  ...the murder sent Azkaban...  "No, I mean it, please die!"  ...where sentenced Dementors watch whoever she'd killed, die die die infinite repeating loop. Though must put Azkaban recently, amount life left voice.  The thought came Harry, then, Professor Quirrell passed doors, heard sounds, given slightest sign disturbance; Harry would called positive proof evil, Harry's lips remained silent presence Bellatrix, breathing regular, something inside screamed screamed screamed.  The Patronus brightened, control, brightened, every step Harry took forward.  It brightened Harry Bellatrix descended stairs, stumbled Harry offered left arm thrust outside Cloak, braving sense doom close snake draped around neck. There surprised look face, accepted it, said nothing.  It helped Harry, able help Bellatrix, enough.  Not saw huge metal door center level's corridor.  Not came closer, woman's voice fell silent, Patronus near now, reliving worst memory more.  Good, said voice inside him. That step one.  Harry's steps carried inevitably forward toward metal door.  And...  Now unlock door -  ...Harry kept walking...  What think doing? Go back get there!  ...kept walking...  Save her! What doing? She's hurting YOU HAVE TO SAVE HER!  The portkey Harry carrying could transport two humans, two, plus minus snake. If they'd Professor Quirrell's portkey too... didn't, Professor Quirrell's human form carrying that, way get it... Harry could save one person today, one person lowest level Azkaban, desperate need...  "DON'T GO!" The voice came scream behind metal door. "No, no, no, go, take away, don't -"  There light corridor grew brighter.  "Please," sobbed woman's voice, "please, I can't remember children's names -"  "Sit down, Bella," Harry's voice said, somehow kept voice cold whisper, "I must deal this," Hover Charm diminishing switching even Bella obediently sat down, skeletal form dark brightening air.  I'll die, thought Harry.  The air went brightening.  After all, certainty Harry would die.  It probability death, things worth probability dying?  The air went brightening, greater Patronus beginning form around him, brilliant human shape becoming indistinct within burning air, Harry's life went feed fire.  If I wipe Dementors, even I live, they'll know me, I one this... I'll lose support, lose war...  Yeah? said inner voice urging on. After destroy Dementors Azkaban? I'd think that'd tend prove credentials Light Lord, actually, SAVE HER SAVE HER YOU HAVE TO SAVE HER -  The humanoid shape could longer seen separate entity.  The corridor seen.  Harry's body invisible within Cloak.  There bodiless viewpoint within infinite expanse silver light.  Harry could feel life leaving him, fueling spell; far away, could feel shadows Death begin fray.  I meant accomplish life this... I going fight Dark Lord, I going merge wizarding Muggle worlds...  Lofty goals seemed distant, abstract, compared one woman begging help, certain Harry would ever anything important one thing, one thing could here.  And might last breath, Harry thought:  There Dementors, probably Azkabans... I'm going this, I I'm closer central pit, take less life way, increases probability I'll survive destroy Dementors... even assuming optimal thing do, there's right time place this, here, IT ISN'T NOW AND HERE!  What? said part indignantly, searched counterargument exist -  Slowly light died back down, Harry concentrated one indisputable fact, one obvious truth optimal place, time now...  Slowly light died back down.  Part Harry's life flowed back him.  Part lost radiation.  But Harry enough left stay feet, keep silver human shape bright; wand arm raised voice whispered "Wingardium Leviosa", magic flowed obediently helped Bellatrix feet. (For magic expended, never magic fueled Patronus Charm.)  I swear, Harry thought, breathing regularly could Bellatrix's presence, tears streamed invisible cheeks, I swear upon life magic art rationalist, I swear everything I hold sacred happy memories, I give oath someday I end place, please, please may I forgiven...  And two walked on, murderess's voice screamed begged someone come back save her.  There time, ceremony, Harry's sacrifice piece himself, Bellatrix beside Harry keep walking without pause, saying nothing, breathing evenly.  So Harry walked on, leaving piece behind. It would dwell place time forever, knew. Even Harry came back someday company True Patronus casters destroyed Dementors here. Even melted triangular building burned island low enough sea would wash it, leaving trace place ever existed. Even get back.   The flock luminous creatures stopped staring downward, began patrolling metal corridor nothing happened.  "Just like last time?" Director Bones snapped direction Auror Li, young Auror replied, "Yes, ma'am."  The Director fired another query see Dementors could find target, looked unsurprised hear negative reply seconds later.  Emmeline Vance feeling torn loyalties.  Emmeline member Order Phoenix more, disbanded end last war. And war, she'd known, they'd known, Director Crouch quietly approved off-the-books battle.  Director Bones Crouch.  But hunting Bellatrix Black now, Death Eater, certainly rescued Death Eaters. Their Patronuses behaving oddly - bright creatures stopping staring downward, they'd gone back following masters. And Dementors find target.  It seemed would extremely good time consult Albus Dumbledore.  Should suggest Director Bones contact Dumbledore? But Director Bones contacted already...  Emmeline wavered while, probably long, finally decided. The hell it, thought. We're side, need stick together whether Director Bones likes not.  At thought, silver sparrow fluttered onto shoulder.  "Drop behind us guard rear," Emmeline murmured softly, almost without moving lips, "wait one looking directly you, go Albus Dumbledore. If already himself, wait is. And tell this: Bellatrix Black breaking Azkaban, Dementors cannot find her."   Chapter 56: TSPE, Constrained Optimization, Pt 6  Silent, thankfully silent, metal door next level down. Either someone behind there, hurting quietly, maybe screaming voice given already, muttering quietly dark...  I'm sure I this, Harry thought, blame despairing thought Dementors either. It would better lower, safer lower, plan would take time implement Aurors probably already working way down. But Harry pass metal doors staying silent keeping breathing perfectly regular, might go mad; leave piece behind one, soon anything left -  A luminous moonlit cat leaped existence landed front Harry's Patronus. Harry almost screamed, helped image Bellatrix.  "Harry!" said voice Professor McGonagall, sounding alarmed Harry ever heard her. "Where you? Are right? This Patronus, answer me!"  With convulsive effort, Harry cleared mind, repurposed throat, forced calm, swapped different personality like Occlumency barrier. It took seconds hoped like hell Professor McGonagall notice problem thanks communications delay, hoped like hell Patronuses report surroundings.  A young boy's innocent voice said, "I'm Mary's Place, Professor, Diagon Alley. Going restroom actually. What's wrong?"  The cat leaped away, Bellatrix began chuckle softly, dusty appreciative laughter, cut abruptly hiss Harry.  A moment later cat returned, said Professor McGonagall's voice, "I'm coming pick right now. Don't go anywhere, around Defense Professor go back him, say anything anyone, I'll quickly I can!"  And bright cat blurred forward vanished.  Harry glanced watch, noting time, got everyone here, Professor Quirrell anchored Time-Turner again, could go back restroom Mary's Place appropriate time...  You know, said problem-solving part brain, there's limit many constraints add problem really impossible, know that?  It mattered, really, compare suffering single prisoner Azkaban, yet Harry still found feeling aware plan end picked Mary's Place like he'd never left, Defense Professor looking completely innocent wrongdoing, Professor McGonagall going kill him.   As team prepared eat another bite territory C spiral, shielding scanning dispelling previous shield rear, Amelia tapping fingers hip wondering ought consult obvious expert. If -  Amelia heard familiar crack fire knew would see turned.  A third Aurors spinning around leveling wands old wizard half-moon glasses long silver beard appeared directly within midst, bright red-golden phoenix shoulder.  "Hold fire!" Polyjuice made easy forge face, faking phoenix travel would rather difficult - wards permitted one fast ways Azkaban, though fast ways out.  The old witch old wizard stared long moment.  (Amelia wondered, back mind, Aurors sent word, several former members Order Phoenix her; tried remember, back mind, she'd seen Emmeline's sparrow Andy's cat missing flock bright creatures; knew futile. It might even people, old meddler often knew things way knowing.)  Albus Dumbledore inclined head Amelia courteous gesture. "I hope I unwelcome here," wizard said calmly. "We side, not?"  "That depends," Amelia said hard voice. "Are help us catch criminals, protect consequences actions?" Are going try stop killer brother getting well-deserved Kiss, old meddler? From Amelia heard, Dumbledore gotten smarter toward end war, mostly due Mad-Eye's nonstop nagging; relapsed foolish mercies instant Voldemort's body found.  A dozen small points white silver, reflections shining animals, gleamed old wizard's half-moon glasses spoke. "Even less would I see Bellatrix Black freed," old wizard said. "She must leave prison alive, Amelia."  Before Amelia could speak again, even express surprised gratification, old wizard gestured long black wand blazing silver phoenix sprang existence, brighter perhaps Patronuses put together. It first time she'd seen spell cast wordlessly. "Order Aurors cancel Patronus Charms ten seconds," said old wizard. "What darkness cannot find, light may."  Amelia snapped order communications officer, would notify Aurors mirrors, commanding Dumbledore's done.  That took moments, became period awful silence, none Aurors daring speak, Amelia tried weigh thoughts. She must leave prison alive... Albus Dumbledore turn Bartemius Crouch without strong reason. If he'd meant tell why, already would have; certainly positive sign.  Still, good know they'd able work together one.  "Now," said chorus mirrors, Patronus Charms winked except blazing silver phoenix.  "Is another Patronus still present?" old wizard said clearly bright creature.  The bright creature dipped head nod.  "Can find it?"  The silver head nodded again.  "Will remember it, depart come again?"  A final nod blazing phoenix.  "It done," Dumbledore said.  "Over," said mirrors moment later, Amelia raised wand began recasting Patronus. (Though took extra concentration, wolfish smile already face, think first time Susan kissed cheek, instead dwelling looming fate Bellatrix Black. That Kiss happy thought indeed, quite right kind Patronus Charm.)   They even gotten end corridor Harry's Patronus raised hand, politely, though classroom.  Harry thought quickly. The question - no, also obvious.  "It seems," Harry said coldly amused voice, "that someone instructed Patronus speak message me." He chuckled. "Well then. Pardon me, dear Bella. Quietus."  At silver humanoid said Harry's voice, "There another Patronus seeks Patronus."  "What?" said Harry. And then, without pausing think happening, "Can block it? Stop finding you?"  The silver humanoid shook head.   No sooner Amelia Aurors finish recasting Patronus Charms, -  The blazing silver phoenix flew off, true red-golden phoenix followed it, old wizard calmly strode long wand gripped low.  The shields around territory parted around old wizard like water, closed behind hardly ripple.  "Albus!" shouted Amelia. "What think doing?"  But already knew.  "Do follow me," old wizard's voice said sternly. "I protect myself, I cannot protect others."  The curse Amelia shouted made even Aurors flinch.   This fair, fair, fair! There's limit many constraints add problem really impossible!  Harry blocked useless thoughts, ignored fatigue feeling, forced mind confront new requirements, think fast, use adrenaline following chains logic quickly without hesitation, instead wasting despair.  For mission succeed,  (1) Harry would dispel Patronus.  (2) Bellatrix needed hidden Dementors Patronus dispelled.  (3) Harry needed resist Dementors' drain Patronus dispelled.  ...  If I solve one, said Harry's brain, I want cookie afterward, make problem difficult this, I mean slightest bit difficult, I climbing skull heading Tahiti.  Harry brain considered problem.  Azkaban stood invincible centuries, relying upon impossibility evading Dementors' gaze. So Harry found another way hide Bellatrix Dementors, would rely either scientific knowledge realization Dementors Death.  Harry's brain suggested obvious way stop Dementors seeing Bellatrix make stop existing, i.e., kill her.  Harry congratulated brain thinking outside box told continue searching.  Kill bring back, came next suggestion. Use Frigideiro cool Bellatrix point brain activity stops, warm afterward using Thermos, like people fall cold water successfully revived half-an-hour later without noticeable brain damage.  Harry considered this. Bellatrix might survive debilitated state. And might stop Death seeing her. And he'd trouble carrying cold unconscious Bellatrix far. And Harry remember research exact body temperature supposed nonfatal temporarily-brain-halting.  It another good outside-the-box idea, Harry told brain keep thinking of...  ...ways hide Death...  A frown moved Harry's face. He'd heard something that, somewhere.  One requisites becoming powerful wizard excellent memory, Professor Quirrell said. The key puzzle often something read twenty years ago old scroll, peculiar ring saw finger man met once...  Harry focused hard could, remember, tip tongue remember; told subconscious go trying recollect it, refocused attention half problem.  How I protect Dementors without Patronus Charm?  The Headmaster repeatedly exposed Dementor steps away, over throughout whole day, come looking merely tired. How Headmaster done that? Could Harry too?  It could random genetic thing, case Harry screwed. But assuming problem solvable...  Then obvious answer Dumbledore afraid death.  Dumbledore really afraid death. Dumbledore honestly, truly believed death next great adventure. Believed core, convenient words used suppress cognitive dissonance, pretending wise. Dumbledore decided death natural normative order, whatever tiny lingering fear still him, taken long time repeated exposures Dementor drain small flaw.  That avenue closed Harry.  And Harry thought flip side, obvious inverse question:  Why I much vulnerable average? Other students fall faced Dementor.  Harry meant destroy Death, end could. He meant live forever, could; hope it, thought Death brought sense despair inevitability. He blindly attached life; indeed taken effort burn away life need protect others Death. Why shadows Death power Harry? He would thought afraid.  Was Harry, along, who'd rationalizing? Who secretly afraid death twisting thoughts, Harry accused Dumbledore?  Harry considered this, preventing flinching away. It felt uncomfortable, but...  But...  But uncomfortable thoughts always true, one sound exactly right. Like grain truth, hiding hypothesis said -  And Harry realized.  Oh.  Oh, I understand now.  The one afraid, is...  Harry asked dark side thought death.  And Harry's Patronus wavered, dimmed, almost went upon instant, desperate, sobbing, screaming terror, unutterable fear would anything die, throw everything aside die, think straight feel straight presence absolute horror, look abyss nonexistence could stared straight Sun, blind terrified thing wanted find dark corner hide think -  The silver figure darkened moonlight, flickering like failing candle -  It's right, thought Harry, right.  Visualizing cradling dark side like frightened child arms.  It's right proper horrified, death horrible. You hide horror, feel ashamed it, wear badge honor, openly Sun.  It strange, feel split two like this, track thoughts gave comfort, track thoughts followed dark side's incomprehension alienness ordinary Harry's thoughts; things dark side associated fear death, one thing never expected imagined might find, acceptance praise help...  You fight alone, Harry said silently dark side. The rest back this. I let die, I let friends die either. Not you/I, Hermione, Mum Dad, Neville Draco anyone, protect... Visualizing wings sunlight, like wings Patronus spread, give shelter frightened child.  The Patronus brightened again, world spun around Harry mind spinning?  Take hand, Harry thought visualized, come me, thing together...     There lurch Harry's mind, like brain taken one step left, universe taken one step right.  And brightly lit corridor Azkaban, dim gas lights far outshone steady unwavering light human-shaped Patronus, invisible boy stood strange small smile face, shaking slightly.  Harry knew, somehow, he'd done something significant, something went beyond strengthening resistance Dementors.  And that, he'd remembered. Thinking Death anthropomorphic figure done trick, ironically enough. Now Harry could remember it, reputed hide someone gaze Death himself...   In corridor Azkaban, wizard's striding legs came abrupt halt; bright silver thing guide, halted midair, fluttering wings distress. The brilliant white phoenix craned head, looking backward forward though confused; turned master shook head apology.  Without another word, old wizard turned strode back way came.   Harry stood straight upright, feeling fear wash around him. Some tiny part might eroded little waves emptiness broke continually upon unmoving stone, limbs cold, magic him. In time waves might corrode consume him, sneaking whatever tiny part still cowered Death instead using fear energize battle. But doom would take time, shadows Death far away uncaring him. The flaw, crack, fault-line repaired, stars blazed brightly mind, vast unafraid, brilliant midst cold darkness.  To anyone else's eyes, would seemed boy stood alone dimly lit metal corridor, wearing strange smile.  For Bellatrix Black snake draped around shoulders concealed Cloak Invisibility, one three Deathly Hallows reputed hide wearer gaze Death himself. The riddle whose answer lost, Harry found anew.  And Harry knew, now, concealment Cloak mere transparency Disillusionment, Cloak kept hidden invisible, unseeable Thestrals unknowing. And Harry also knew Thestral blood painted symbol Deathly Hallows inside Cloak, binding Cloak portion Death's power, enabling Cloak confront Dementors level block them. It felt like guessing, yet certain guess, knowledge coming instant solving riddle.  Bellatrix still transparent within Cloak, Harry longer hidden, knew there, obvious Thestral. For Harry loaned Cloak, given it; comprehended mastered Deathly Hallow passed Potter line.  Harry gazed directly invisible woman, said, "Can Dementors reach you, Bella?"  "No," said woman soft, wondering voice. Then, "But Lord... you..."  "If say anything foolish, annoy me," Harry said coldly. "Or impression I would sacrifice you?"  "No, Lord," Dark Lord's servant replied, sounding puzzled, perhaps awed.  "Follow," spoke Harry's cold whisper.  And continued journey downward, Dark Lord reached pouch, took cookie, ate it. If Bellatrix asked, Harry would claimed chocolate, ask.   The old wizard strode back midst Aurors, silver red-golden phoenixes following behind.  "You -" Amelia began bellow.  "They dismissed Patronus," said Dumbledore. The old wizard seem raise voice calm words somehow overrode own. "I cannot find now."  Amelia gritted teeth, put number scathing remarks hold, turned communications officer. "Tell duty room ask Dementors sense Bellatrix Black."  The communications specialist spoke mirror moment, seconds later, looked up, surprised. "No -"  Amelia already cursing violently mind.  "- see someone else lower levels prisoner."  "Fine!" snapped Amelia. "Tell Dementor dozen kind authorized enter Azkaban seize whoever anyone company! And see Bellatrix Black, they're Kiss immediately!"  Amelia turned glared toward Dumbledore, then, daring argue; old wizard looked bit sadly, held peace.   Auror McCusker finished speaking corpse drifted outside window, conveying Director's orders.  The corpse gave deathly smile almost unstrung limbs, floated downward.  Soon after, dozen Dementors arose drifted central pit Azkaban, headed outward, toward walls vast metal structure towered them.  Entering holes set base Azkaban, darkest creatures began march horror.   Chapter 57: TSPE, Constrained Cognition, Pt 7  Harry hoped he'd achieved fusion mysterious dark side would enabled draw benefits none drawbacks, call crystal clarity indomitable demand, without needing go cold angry.  Once again, he'd overestimated much progress he'd made. Something happened, Harry still mysterious dark side, still separate him, ordinary self still domitable. And despite repair work he'd done dark side's fear death, dare go dark unshielded Azkaban, tempting fate way much.  Which unfortunate, bit nondomitability would sure come handy now.  What made harder slump wall, break tears, even heave sigh. His dear Bella watching sort thing Dark Lord would do.  "My Lord -" Bellatrix said. Her low voice strained. "The Dementors - coming - I feel them, Lord -"  "Thank you, Bella," said dry voice, "I already know that."  Harry sense holes world way he'd wearing Deathly Hallow, could feel empty pull increasing intensity. At first he'd mistaken result descending stairwell, Bellatrix finished descending pull gone increasing. Then decreased, Dementors moved away along spiral, increased went another flight stairs... There Dementors within Azkaban now, coming him. Of course were. Harry might resistant now, hidden.  New requirement, Harry told brain. Find way defeating Dementors invoke Patronus Charm. Alternatively, find yet another way hiding someone Dementors, besides Cloak Invisibility -  I quit, said brain. Find another piece computing substrate solve ridiculously overconstrained problems.  I mean it, thought Harry.  So I, said brain. Put Patronus Charm wait Aurors find you. Be sensible. It's over.  Give up...  The sucking emptiness seemed pull harder, thought it; Harry realized happening, concentrated intensely stars, turned mind away despair -  You know, observed logical side him, allowed think negative thoughts open mind Dementors, that's cognitive bias too, would know actually time give up?  A desperate sobbing scream rose below, words mixed like "no" "away". The prisoners knew, prisoners could feel it.  The Dementors coming.  "My Lord, - risk - take back Cloak -"  "Be silent, fool," hissed angry voice. "When I decide sacrifice I tell so."  She's got valid point, said Slytherin. You risk her, there's way life valuable yours.  For instant Harry considered sacrificing Bellatrix save -  And moment, dim orange gas-light seemed flee corridor, touch cold crept Harry's fingertips. And knew, then, think leaving Bellatrix shadows Death, would make vulnerable more. Even moment making decision, might become unable cast Patronus Charm, would given thought saved before.  It occurred Harry could still take Cloak Bellatrix afterward, even cast Patronus Charm; wrench thoughts away option, focus firmly decision it, might fallen stood. For whirlpool emptiness swirling around deadly strong; screams coming above, screams stopped.  This ridiculous, said logical side. Rational agents put sort censored reasoning process, theorems assume think affect reality apart actual actions, free choose optimal algorithm without worrying thoughts interact Dementors -  ...  That really dumb idea, said Gryffindor. Even I think dumb idea I'm Gryffindor side. You're seriously going stand -   "We fix!" shouted Ora, holding magic mirror though triumph. "The Dementor outside inner wall pointed level seven, C spiral, that's are!"  Her Aurors looking expectantly.  "No," Amelia said level voice. "That's one is. The Dementors still can't find Bellatrix Black. We running letting confusion, dividing forces ambushed. So long move caution, can't lose. Tell Scrimgeour Shacklebolt keep going level level, -"  The old wizard already striding forward. Amelia even bother cursing him, time, carefully constructed shields parted like water rippled gently wake.   Harry waited beginning corridor, next stairs leading upward. Bellatrix snake behind him, concealed Deathly Hallow Harry mastered; knew, though could see, emaciated sorceress sitting upon stairs, slumped back, since Harry withdrawn Hover Charm free mind magic.  Harry's eyes fixed far end corridor, next stairs led downward. Not mind now, true reality, light corridor dimmed, temperature fallen. The fear thundered around like sea whipped hurricane winds, sucking emptiness become howling draw toward approaching black hole.  Up stairs far end, floating smoothly dying air, came voids, absences, wounds world.  And Harry expected stop.  With focus could muster, Harry expected stop.  Anticipated stopping.  Believed would stop.  ...that idea, anyway...  Harry shut dangerous stray thought, expected Dementors halt. They intelligence own, wounds world, form structure borrowed others' expectations. People able negotiate them, offer victims exchange cooperation, believed Dementors would bargain. So Harry believed hard enough voids would turn go, would turn go.  But wounds world kept coming, swirling fear seemed like solid thing now, emptiness tearing matter well mind, substance well spirit, could see metal beginning tarnish holes world passed.  A small sound came behind him, Bellatrix, said word, instructed remain silent.  Don't think creatures, think psychosensitive objects, controlled I control -  The problem control easily, make believe blue green act will. Couldn't suppress thoughts irrational make believe something. How impossible trick believing something knew doing. All training Harry given self-deception refusing switch matter harmful unique special case -  The shadows Death crossed halfway point corridor, Harry held hand, fingers spread, said voice firm confident command, "Stop."  The shadows Death stopped.  Behind Harry, Bellatrix gave strangled gasp, like torn her.  Harry gestured her, signal set advance meant, repeat heard Dementors say.  "They say," Bellatrix said, voice shaking, "they said, 'Bellatrix Black promised us. Tell us hides, spared.'"  "Bellatrix?" Harry said, making voice sound amused. "She escaped ago."  A moment later, Harry realized said Bellatrix among Aurors top level, would caused confusion -  No, wrong think Dementors trickable, merely things, controlled expectations -  "They say," Bellatrix said cracked voice, "they say know lying."  The voids began move forward again.  Her anticipations solidly believed mine; controlling them, unwittingly -  "Don't resist," Harry said, pointing wand behind him.  "I, I love you, farewell, Lord -"  "Somnium."  It helped, strangely enough, hearing particular awful words, understanding Bellatrix's mistake; reminded Harry fighting.  "Stop," Harry said again. Bellatrix asleep; will, expectations rather, control spheres annihilation -  But kept gliding forward, Harry stop worrying previous experience damaged confidence, meant able stop them, noticed thinking that, doubted even - needed time prepare, really ought practice controlling one Dementor cage first -  There quarter corridor Harry shadows death, empty winds strong Harry could feel erosion beginning cracks himself.  And thought came Harry maybe wrong, maybe Dementors desires planning capability. Or maybe controlled everyone thought worked, whoever closest them. And either case -  Harry drew wand starting position Patronus Charm, spoke.  "One number went Hogwarts return. It longer exists; Death dead."  The Dementors halted, dozen wounds world stood motionless, emptiness screamed around like deadly wind nowhere.  "Turn go speak anyone, little shadows, I destroy well."  Harry's fingers slid starting position Patronus Charm, readied cast it; mind, Earth shone among stars, day side bright blue reflected sunlight, night side glimmering light human cities. Harry bluffing, trying anything tricky thoughts. The shadows Death would move forward annihilated, would depart, equally ready either...  And voids retreated back smoothly came, winds nothingness lessening meter traversed, slid back stairs, departed.  Whether truly pseudo-intelligence, whether Harry finally succeeded expecting go... that, Harry know.  But gone.  Harry took moment sit beside unconscious Bellatrix stairs, slumped slumped, closing eyes moment, moment, sure hell planning sleep Azkaban, needed take moment. The Aurors would still going stairs slowly, Harry hoped, hurt take five minutes rest. Harry careful keep thoughts positive, cheerful, my, I'll nice regenerative rest here, I'll feel better, rather than, say, my, I'll collapse emotional physical exhaustion, Dementors yet retreated far.  And way, Harry said brain, fired.   "I found him!" cried old wizard's voice.  Who? thought Amelia, turned see Dumbledore's return, carrying arms -  - one sight, one person, would never expected behold -  - man torn red robes, looking scorched like he'd fought small war, blood dried many cuts. His eyes open, chewing bar chocolate, held one living hand.  Bahry One-Hand alive.  A glad cry went up, Aurors lowering wands, already starting rush forward.  "Stay guard!" bellowed Amelia. "Check Polyjuice - scan Bahry small Animagi traps -"   "Innervate. Wingardium Leviosa."  There pause. Harry sensed, though could quite see, invisible woman pushing feet, turning head look around. "I'm... alive...?"  Harry sorely tempted say no, see made that. Instead hissed, "Don't ask stupid questions."  "What happened?" whispered Bellatrix.  And Dark Lord gave wild, high-pitched laugh, said, "I scared Dementors away, dear Bella."  There pause. Harry wished could see Bellatrix's face; said wrong thing?  After time, quavering voice, "Could be, Lord, new form, begun care -"  "No," Harry said coldly, turned (though kept wand her), began walking. "And take care offend again, I abandon here, use use. Now follow, left behind; I work do."  Harry strode forward, listening gasping sounds came behind him; knew Bellatrix following.  ...because last thing woman needed, last thing needed start thinking psychiatric healer began trying deprogram her, believe Dark Lord could ever love back.   The old wizard smoothed silver beard contemplatively, looking Auror Bahry carried room two strong Aurors.  "Do understand this, Amelia?"  "No," said simply. She suspected trap yet able fathom, Auror Bahry going kept outside main party guarded.  "Perhaps," old wizard said length, "whichever number cast Patronus Charm, simple hostage. Someone tricked this, mayhap? For whatever reason, left Auror alive; let us first wield deadly curses, find -"  "I see," said old witch sudden realization, "that plan. It costs nothing Oblivate leave alive, makes us hesitate -" Amelia nodded decisively, said people, "We carry before."  The old wizard sighed. "Any news Dementors?"  "If I tell you," Amelia snapped, "will run again?"  "It costs nothing, Amelia," old wizard said quietly, "and may save one people fight."  Costs nothing except chance vengeance -  But nothing compared other, annoying old wizard often right end, part made annoying.  "The Dementors ceased answer questions person said saw," Amelia told him, "and say why, where."  Dumbledore turned blazing silver phoenix shoulder, whose light illuminated whole corridor, received silent headshake reply. "I cannot detect either," said Dumbledore. Then shrugged. "I suppose I shall walk whole spiral top bottom see anything turns up, shall I?"  Amelia would ordered it, thought would made tiniest difference.  "Albus," said Amelia old wizard turned depart, "even ambushed."  "Nonsense, dear," old wizard said cheerfully strode yet again, waving though admonition fifteen-inch wand unidentifiable dark-grey wood, "I'm invincible."  There pause.  ("He really say -" whispered newest Auror present, still-prim young lady name Noelle Curry, senior member trio, Auror Brooks. "Did he?")  ("He get away it," Isabel whispered back her, "he's Dumbledore, even Fate takes seriously anymore.")  "And that," Amelia said heavily, benefit younger Aurors, "is never call anything unless absolutely must."   Harry lay still hard bench served bed cell, blanket pulled him, staying absolutely motionless could waited fear return. There Patronus approaching, powerful one. Bellatrix hidden Deathly Hallow, easy Charm would penetrate that; Harry know arts Aurors might employ detect self, dared reveal ignorance asking her. So Harry lay hard bed, cell locked door, mighty metal door locked behind him, absolute darkness, thin blanket pulled him, hoping whoever look in, look closely -  That point Harry could affect, really, part fate lay entirely hands Hidden Variables. Most mind concentrating ongoing Transfiguration performing.  Listening silence, Harry heard quick footsteps approach; paused outside door, -  - continued onward.  Soon fear returned.  Harry allow notice relief, allowed notice fear. He holding mind form Muggle device rather larger car battery, slowly applying Form substance ice cube (which Harry frozen using Frigideiro water bottle pouch). You supposed Transfigure things burned, original substance water, Bubble-Head Charm protect air supply, Harry hoped make anyone else sick.  Now question whether would enough time Aurors detailed check cell block, Harry finish Transfiguration, partial Transfiguration would -   When old wizard strode back empty-handed, even Amelia began feel twinge worry. She two Auror teams worked third way three spirals, synchrony allow gap coverage could jumped cutting ceiling, they'd yet find sign.  "Might I ask report?" Amelia said, keeping edge voice.  "First simple walk top bottom," said old wizard. He frowning, wrinkling face even usual. "I examined Bellatrix's cell, found death doll left place. This escape meant go unremarked, I think. There something hidden corner beneath scrap cloth; I left undisturbed Aurors examine. On return trip, I opened door looked within cells. I saw nothing Disillusioned, prisoners -"  They interrupted scream red-golden phoenix, Aurors flinched it. Condemnation it, urgent demand almost started Amelia running corridor spot.  "- rather distressing condition," Dumbledore said quietly. For moment blue eyes cold beneath half-moon glasses. "Will speak consequences actions?"  "I -" Amelia began.  "I know," said old wizard. "My apologies, Amelia." He sighed. "Some recent prisoners scraps magic left, I looked upon them, I sensed uneaten power; strongest much magic left first-year child. I heard Fawkes scream distress many times, never challenge. It seems shall continue search; hide well enough escape mere glance."   When Harry finished first Transfiguration, sat up, pulled back blanket covered him, cast quick Lumos, glanced watch, shocked see nearly hour thirty minutes passed. How much time gone since someone opened door closed - Harry looking direction, course - that, Harry guess.  "My Lord...?" whispered Bellatrix's voice, soft tentative.  "You may speak now," Harry said. He'd told remain silent worked.  "That Dumbledore looked upon us."  Pause.  "Interesting," Harry said neutrally. He glad noticed time. That sounded like rather close shave.  Harry said word pouch, began drawing forth magical device would mate product hour's labor. Then, drawn forth, another word brought forth tube industrial-strength glue; using it, Harry cast Bubble-Head Charm Bellatrix, Bellatrix cast Charm snake, glue fumes enclosed cell would harm them.  When glue begun set, binding technology magic, Harry laid upon bed, sat floor, resting magic moment essaying next Transfiguration.  "My Lord..." Bellatrix said hesitantly.  "Yes?" said dry voice.  "What device made?"  Harry thought rapidly. It seemed like good chance check plans her, guise leading questions.  "Consider, dear Bella," said Harry smoothly. "How difficult powerful wizard cut walls Azkaban?"  There pause, Bellatrix's voice came, slow puzzled, "Not difficult all, Lord...?"  "Indeed," said dry, high voice Bella's master. "Suppose one this, fly hole broomstick, soar away. Rescuing prisoner Azkaban would seem easy then, would not?"  "But Lord..." said Bella. "The Aurors would - broomsticks, Lord, fast ones -"  Harry listened, thought. The Dark Lord replied, tones smoothly Socratic inquiry, Bellatrix asked question, Harry expected, Harry's counterquestion showed matter end. And response Bellatrix's last question, Dark Lord smiled, said time resume work.  And Harry got floor cell, went far end cells, touched wand hard surface wall - wall Azkaban, solid metal separated direct exposure Dementors' pit.  And Harry began partial Transfiguration.  This spell would go faster, Harry hoped. He'd spent hours hours practicing unique magic, made routine, much difficult ordinary Transfiguration. The shape changing much total volume, Transfigured shape might tall wide long, thin. Half millimeter, Harry thought, would enough, considering perfect smoothness...  On long bench served prison bed, Harry set Transfigured technological device mated magic item glue dry, tiny letters golden script gleamed Muggle artifact. Harry really planned there, they'd kept running back mind, seemed become part Transfigured form.  There many different things Harry could said using particular triumph technological ingenuity. Any number things would be, one sense another, appropriate. Or least things Harry could said, would said, Bellatrix there.  But one thing say, Harry would get chance say once, probably never get better chance say ever again. (Or think, anyway, say it.) He seen actual movie, he'd seen preview, reason phrase stuck mind.  The tiny golden letters upon Muggle device said,  All right, primitive screwheads! Listen up!   Chapter 58: TSPE, Constrained Cognition, Pt 8  A/N: A movie trailer Army Darkness, resembling one Harry saw, THV1KkPXIxQ YouTube.  The key quote follows, spoken man modern times listeners Middle Ages:  "All right primitive screwheads! Listen up! You see this? This... boomstick!"   In darkness absolute, boy stood holding wand solid metal wall Azkaban, essaying magic three people world would believed possible, none save alone could wield.  Of course powerful wizard could've cut wall seconds, gesture word.  For average adult might matter minutes' work, afterward would winded.  But accomplish end first-year Hogwarts student, efficient.  Luckily - well, luckily, luck nothing - conscientiously, Harry practiced Transfiguration extra hour every day, point ahead even Hermione one class; he'd practiced partial Transfiguration point thoughts begun taking true universe granted, required slightly effort keep timeless quantum nature mind, even kept firm mental separation concept Form concept substance.  And problem art become routine...  ...was Harry could think things it.  Somehow thoughts managed go there, confront obvious, faced prospect really actually minutes.  What Harry do...  ...was dangerous.  Really dangerous.  Someone-might-actually-genuinely-get-killed dangerous.  Facing twelve Dementors without Patronus Charm scary, merely scary. Harry could cast Patronus Charm, would cast soon thought danger able so, soon felt resistance beginning fail. And even worked... even so, unless Dementors instructed Kiss anyone found, failure fatal.  This different.  The Transfigured Muggle device could explode kill them.  The interface technology magic could fail number ways kill them.  The Aurors could get lucky shot.  It just, well...  Seriously dangerous.  Harry caught mind trying argue believing safe.  And sure, whole thing could work, but...  But even leaving rationalists ever allowed argue things, Harry knew possibly argued estimating less 20% probability dying.  Lose, said Hufflepuff.  Lose, said voice Professor Quirrell mind.  Lose, said mental model Hermione Professor McGonagall Professor Flitwick Neville Longbottom and, well, basically everyone Harry knew except Fred George, would gone hot second.  He go find Dumbledore turn in. He should, really really should, sane thing point.  And it'd Harry mission, life that'd stake, would have; surely would have.  The part almost causing lose concentration partial Transfiguration performing, part threatening open Dementors...  ...was Professor Quirrell, still unconscious, still snake.  If Professor Quirrell went Azkaban part escape, would die. He probably last even week. He sensitive.  It simple.  If Harry lost here...  He lost Professor Quirrell.  Even though he's probably evil, said Hufflepuff part quietly. Even so?  It decision Harry made conscious way. He it. Losing House points, people.  If think life valuable enough willing take eighty percent probability dying order protect prisoners Azkaban, Slytherin side observed, there's way justify taking twenty percent risk life save Bellatrix Professor Quirrell. The math add up, can't assigning consistent utilities outcomes here.  The logical side noted Slytherin argument.  Harry kept Form mind, kept casting spell. He could always abort mission done Transfiguration, want lose effort he'd already invested.  And Harry thought something else suddenly made hard keep magic going, hard keep resistance Dementors.  What portkey take us Professor Quirrell said did?  It obvious retrospect moment thought it.  Even planned escape went completely right, even Muggle device worked explode interact badly mated magic item, even Aurors get lucky shot, even Harry made far enough away Azkaban use portkey...  ...there might psychiatric healer end it.  That something Harry believed he'd trusted Professor Quirrell, he'd forgotten re-evaluate Professor Quirrell longer trusted.  You can't this, said Hufflepuff.  At point we're talking mere stupidity.  Cold seemed spread room, Harry kept Transfiguration going, even resistance Dementors faltered.  I can't lose Professor Quirrell.  He tried kill police officer, said Hufflepuff. You already lost him, moment. Bellatrix probably everyone thinks is. Just take Cloak back, go find Dumbledore tell tricked.  No, thought Harry desperately, without talking Professor Quirrell, might explanation, I know, maybe standing far enough away Patronus Dementors got him... I understand, make sense hypothesis, would that... I can't just...     Harry turned mind away chain thought completely broke resistance fear, think feeding Professor Quirrell Dementors staying resolved Death, cognitive impossibility.  Your reasoning artificially impaired, observed logical part calmly, find way unimpair it.  All right, let's generate alternatives, Harry thought. Not choose, weigh, certainly commit... think else I might able besides original plan.  And Harry went cutting hole wall. He using partial Transfiguration thin cylindrical shell metal, two meters diameter half millimeter thick, running way wall. He Transfiguring half-millimeter thickness metal motor oil. Motor oil liquid Transfigure liquids might evaporate, Bellatrix snake Bubble-Head Charms. And Harry would cast Finite oil immediately after, dispelling Transfiguration...  ...as soon separated lubricated hunk metal slid wall onto floor cell, he'd slanted gravity would pull in, Transfiguration done.  If Harry Bellatrix exit broomstick resulting hole wall...  Harry's brain suggested could try Transfigure surface cover hole wall, leaving space Bellatrix Professor Quirrell hide in, wearing Cloak, Harry turned in. And Professor Quirrell would eventually wake up, and Bellatrix could try figure exit Azkaban own.  It was, first all, dumb idea, second, would still huge hunk metal floor cell, would give away.  And Harry's brain saw obvious.  Let Bellatrix Professor Quirrell use escape route invented. You stay behind, turn in.  Bellatrix Professor Quirrell ones whose lives stake.  They gaining, losing, taking risk.  And reason, sane reason all, Harry go them.  A calm came Harry thought it, cold darkness wavering around fringes mind retreated. Yes, it, creative outside-the-box route, hidden third alternative. The falseness dilemma obvious retrospect. If Harry turned in, turn Bellatrix Professor Quirrell. If Bellatrix Professor Quirrell took dangerous escape route, Harry need go them.  Harry even need face embarrassment admitting he'd tricked, ordered Bellatrix remove memory. Everyone would assume he'd kidnapped, including Harry himself. Admittedly, plausible reason Dark Lord would ever ask Bellatrix that; Harry could simply smile tell Bellatrix allowed know, would that...   Her Auror team gotten around three-quarters way Azkaban, two teams two spirals. Amelia feeling tenser already, though betting criminals hiding second-to-lowest floor, part wished Dumbledore thought check specific floor carefully part glad hadn't.  And distant sound, like tiny 'tink' noise coming far away. Like loud sound coming second-to-lowest floor, say.  Amelia looked Dumbledore realized, managed stop herself.  The old wizard shrugged, gave small smile, said, "Since asked it, Amelia," went yet again.   "Finite Incantatem," Harry said oil coating giant chunk metal floor. He hardly heard speak, ears still ringing gigantic thud solid metal sliding wall falling. (He put Quieting Charm, retrospect, though stopped noise spreading solid metal floor.) And Harry said again, "Finite Incantatem" oil coating two-meter hole wall, spreading effect wide; magic Harry canceling, made spell almost effortless. Harry feeling bit tired now, last use magic would need. He even needed it, really, Harry want leave Transfigured liquid lying around, want betray secret partial Transfiguration either.  It seemed very... inviting, two-meter hole leading freedom.  The light outside coming in... exactly Sun shining face, brighter anything Azkaban's interior.  Harry tempted go with, hop broomstick Bellatrix snake. Chances would get safely. And get safely, Harry came with, Professor Quirrell could go back time look perfectly innocent, everything could go back normal.  If Harry stayed behind turned in... even everyone assumed Harry hostage, assumed Harry lied Professor McGonagall's Patronus wandpoint... even Harry got lightly, well...  It likely Defense Professor would go teaching Hogwarts.  Professor Quirrell would reached predestined end career, February school year.  And yes, Professor McGonagall would kill Harry, yes, would slow painful.  But staying behind sensible, safe, sane thing do, Harry feeling relaxed regretful.  Harry turned Bellatrix; opened mouth instruct final time -  And hiss, weak hiss, hiss sounded slow confused, hiss said,  "What wass... noisse?"   Through corridor old wizard strode. He came metal door opened it, already knowing memory cells within empty.  Seven mighty discerning incantations wizard spoke then, moved on; would little enough exertion total, cells left check.   "Teacher," Harry hissed. So many emotions bubbling him, once. He knew, though could see, green snake around Bellatrix's shoulders, slowly lifting head look around. "Are you... right, teacher?"  "Teacher?" came weak, confused hiss. "Where iss thiss?   "Prisson," Harry hissed, "the prisson life-eaterss, resscue woman, I. You tried sslay protector man, I blocked killing cursse, ressonance uss... fell unconssciouss, I defeat protector man mysself... guardian Charm wass disspelled, life-eaterss could tell protectorss woman esscaped. There iss ssomeone ssensse guardian Charm, probably sschoolmasster... disspell guardian Charm, find different way hide woman life-eaterss without guardian Charm, learn protect mysself without guardian Charm, sscare life-eaterss without guardian Charm, devisse new esscape plan woman, finally, cut hole thick metal wall prisson even though I firsst-year sstudent. No time explain, musst go now. If never meet again, teacher, I glad know time, even though probably evil. It iss good chance ssay thiss much: Goodbye."  And Harry took broomstick presented Bellatrix, saying simply, "Get on."  He decided keep memories. For one thing, important. For another, Defense Professor started planning week ago, Harry obliterate whole last week, explain Bellatrix exactly needed Obliviated. Harry could probably fool Veritaserum, Dumbledore insisted Harry drop Occlumency shields deeper examination... well, Harry acted heroically throughout.  "Sstop!" said snake. Its voice stronger now. "Sstop, sstop, sstop! What mean, goodbye?"  "Esscape plan iss rissky," said Harry. "My life iss sstake, yourss herss. Sso I sstaying, turning mysself -"  "No!" said snake. The hiss forceful. "Musst not! Not permitted!"  Bellatrix mounted broomstick; Harry could sense (but never see) head turning look him, said word. Awaiting him, perhaps, merely awaiting orders.  "No longer trusst you," Harry said simply. "Not ssince tried sslay protector man."  And snake hissed, "I sseek sslay protector man! Are fool, boy? Sslaying would make ssensse, evil no!"  The Earth ceased turn axis, paused orbit around Sun.  The snake's hiss furious anything Harry ever heard human Professor Quirrell. "Sslay him? Had I ssought sslay would dead within ssecondss, fool boy, wass match me! I ssought ssubdue, dominate, force drop sshieldss upon hiss mind, needed read him, know awaited hiss reply, learn detailss memory sspell -"  "You casst killing cursse!"  "Knew would dodge!"  "Wass hiss life worth sso little? What dodge?"  "Would pusshed way magic, fool boy!"  Again pause planet's spin. Harry thought that.  "Witlesss dunce plotter," hissed snake, angrily hisses seemed overlap slither other's tails, "clever imbecile, cunning idiot, fool untrained Sslytherin, missplaced misstrust hass ruined -"  "Thiss iss fair time argue," Harry observed mildly. The surge relief trying flood canceled increased tension. "Ssince I cannot get angry properly, without opening mysself life-eaterss. Musst russh, ssomeone may heard noisse -"  "Explain esscape plan," snake said imperiously. "Sswiftly!"  Harry explained. Parseltongue words Muggle technology, Harry described function Professor Quirrell seemed understand.  There short hisses, snakish equivalent bark surprised laughter, then, snapped commands. "Tell woman look away, casst sspell ssilence, sset guardian Charm outside door. Will transsform mysself, make sswift improvementss invention, give woman emergency potion sso sshe sshield uss, transsform back disspell Charm. Plan ssafer, then."  "And I believe," Harry hissed, "that healer woman truly awaitss uss?"  "Usse ssensse, boy! Ssupposse I evil. To end usse iss obvioussly I planned. Misssion iss target opportunity, invented ssaw guardian Charm, whole affair meant unnoticed, hid left eating-place. Obvioussly ssee persson pretending healer arrival! Go back eating-place afterward, original plan carriess undissturbed!"  Harry stared invisible snake.  On one hand, saying like made Harry feel rather dumb.  And hand, exactly reassuring.  "Sso," Harry hissed, "what iss plan me, precissely?"  "You ssaid time," came snake's hiss, "but plan iss rule country, obvioussly, even young noble friend hass undersstood now, assk return wissh. Will ssay now, iss time fly, sspeak."   The old wizard reached toward another metal door, behind came endless dead mutter, "I'm serious, I'm serious, I'm serious..." The red-golden phoenix shoulder already screaming urgently, old wizard already wincing, -  Another cry pierced corridor, phoenix-like true phoenix's call.  The wizard's head turned, looked blazing silver creature shoulder, even ephemeral substanceless talons launched spell-entity air.  The false phoenix flew corridor.  The old wizard raced after, legs churning like spry young man sixty.  The true phoenix screamed once, twice, third time, hovering metal door; then, became clear master would return calling, flew reluctantly after.   Professor Quirrell assumed true form, time - Polyjuice lasted hour without redosing - though Defense Professor pale, leaning metal bars nearest cell, magic strong enough seize wand without word, even Bellatrix doffed Cloak placed obediently Harry's waiting hand. The sense doom building more, though full force, Defense Professor's power returned, fringes vast force clashing Harry's slight childish aura.  Harry said aloud description Muggle device, naming observing wizard, Finite Harry turned hard work back ice cube. Professor Quirrell could cast spells something Harry Transfigured, would interaction, however slight, magics, -  Three seconds after, Professor Quirrell holding Transfigured version Muggle device. A single barked word sweep wand, residue glue gone magical item; three incantations later, magical technological fused together though single thing, Charms Unbreakability flawless function cast upon Muggle device.  (Harry felt lot better adult supervision.)  A potion thrown Bellatrix, Professor Quirrell Harry commanded, "Drink," though speaking voice. The emaciated woman already lifting lips, without waiting; evident anyone snake Animagus servant Dark Lord, powerful trusted one.  Harry finished pulling hood Cloak Invisibility head.  A brief terrible magic lashed Defense Professor's wand, scouring hole wall, scarring huge chunk metal lay room's midst; Harry requested, saying method he'd used might identify him.  "Left-hand glove," Harry said pouch, drew forth, put on.  A gesture Defense Professor made harness appear upon Bellatrix's shoulders, another, smaller cloth device upon hand, something like handcuffs wrists, even woman finished drinking potion.  A strange, unhealthy color seemed come Bellatrix's pale face, straightened, sunken eyes seemed brighter far dangerous...  ...small wisps steam coming ears...  (Harry decided think part.)  ...and Bellatrix Black laughed, then, sudden mad laughter rang much loudly amid small prison cells Azkaban.  (Very soon, Defense Professor said, Bellatrix would fall unconscious stay way quite awhile, price potion taken; moments would regain perhaps twentieth part power wielded.)  The Defense Professor threw wand toward Bellatrix, instant later blurred green snake.  An instant Dementors' fear returned room.  Bellatrix flinched slightly, caught wand, gestured without word; snake flew inserted harness back.  Harry said "Up!" broomstick.  Bellatrix attached wand holster hand.  Harry leaped onto two-person broomstick lead position.  Bellatrix followed behind him, took cufflike devices wrists chained hands grips broomstick, even Harry's right hand shoved wand pouch.  And three shot forward hole wall -  - emerging open air, directly Dementors' pit, interior vast triangular prism Azkaban, blue sky clearly visible them, shining daylight.  Harry angled broomstick began accelerating, upward toward center triangular space. His left hand, gloved prevent direct contact skin something Professor Quirrell Transfigured, held switch control Muggle device.  Far them, distant shouts rang out.  All right, primitive screwheads!  Aurors fast racing broomsticks angled sky, diving straight toward them, faint sparks light already blazing downward first shots fired.  Listen up!     "Protego Maximus!" shouted Bellatrix mighty, cracked voice, followed cackling laugh shimmering blue field surrounded them.  You see this?  From decaying pit center Azkaban, hundred Dementors rose air, appearing great mass corpses, flying graveyard; appearing another conglomerate absences seemed form one vast rip world slid upward.  This...  The voice ancient powerful wizard bellowed terrible incantation, great blast white-golden fire shot hole Azkaban's wall, shapeless moment began form wings.  Is...  And Aurors activated Anti-Anti-Gravity Jinx built wards Azkaban, disabling flying spells whose enchantment cast recently changed passphrase.  The lift Harry's broom switched off.  Gravity, hand, stayed on.  Their broom's upward rise slowed, started decelerate, began process turning fall.  My...  But enchantments kept broom pointed direction allowed steering, enchantments kept riders attached somewhat protected acceleration, enchantments still functioning.  BROOMSTICK!  Harry hit ignition switch General Technics made, model Berserker PFRC, N-class, ammonium perchlorate composite propellant, solid-fuel rocket mated Nimbus X200 two-person broomstick.  And noise.   Chapter 59: TSPE, Curiosity, Pt 9  Broomsticks invented Muggle would called Dark Ages, supposedly legendary witch named Celestria Relevo, allegedly great-great-granddaughter Merlin.  Celestria Relevo, whichever person group really invented enchantments, known darned thing Newtonian mechanics.  Broomsticks, therefore, worked Aristotelian physics.  They went pointed them.  If wanted move straight forward, pointed straight forward; worry keeping thrust going downward cancel effect gravity.  If turned broomstick, new velocity new direction pointing, go sideways based old momentum.  Broomsticks maximum speeds, maximum accelerations. Not anything air resistance, broomstick maximum Aristotelian impetus enchantments could exert.  Harry never explicitly noticed before, despite dextrous enough get best grades flying class. Broomsticks worked much like human mind instinctively expected work brain managed entirely overlook physical absurdity. Harry, first Thursday broomstick lessons, distracted interesting-seeming phenomena, words written paper glowing red ball. So brain simply suspended disbelief, marked reality broomsticks accepted, proceeded fun, without ever thinking question whose answer would obvious. For sad fact ever think tiny fraction phenomena encounter...  That story Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres almost killed lack curiosity.  Because rockets work Aristotelian physics.  Rockets work like human mind instinctively thought flying thing work.  A rocket-assisted broomstick, therefore, move like magical broomsticks upon Harry good flyer.  None actually went Harry's mind time.  For one thing, loudest noise he'd ever heard life preventing hearing think.  For another thing, accelerating upward four gravities meant around two half seconds, total, go bottom top Azkaban.  And even two half longest seconds history Time, enough room much thinking.  There time see lights Aurors' curses arrowing him, slightly angle broomstick avoid them, realize broomstick simply continuing mostly momentum instead going direction pointed it, activate wordless concepts  crap   Newton  whereupon Harry angled broomstick much harder started quickly approach wall angled back way lights coming Dementors sliding smoothly toward along kind giant winged creature white-golden flame Harry wrenched broomstick back toward sky still sliding toward another wall tilted broom slightly stopped approaching close tilted distant Aurors broomsticks distant going crash woman spun broomstick straight away another instant realized rocket extremely powerful flamethrower fraction second would pointing directly Auror spun broomstick sideways kept going remember pointing Aurors least pointing  Harry missed another Auror meter, zipping past sideways-pointed flamethrower moving upward at, Harry would later guess, around 300 kilometers per hour.  If screams roasted Aurors hear them, evidence one way another, Harry hearing moment extremely loud noise.  A couple calmer quieter seconds later, seem Aurors around, Dementors, giant winged flame creatures, vast terrible edifice Azkaban looked surprisingly tiny height.  Harry got broomstick pointed toward Sun, faintly visible clouds, high sky time day month winter, broomstick accelerated another two seconds direction picked amazing amount speed quickly solid-fuel rocket burned out.  After that, Harry could hear think again, howling wind ridiculous speed, Harry's enchantment-assisted fingers gripping broomstick merely resisting decelerating drag moving way faster terminal velocity, Harry actually thought stuff Newtonian mechanics Aristotelian physics broomsticks rocketry importance curiosity never going anything Gryffindor ever least learned Dark Lord's secret immortality listened Professor Quirinus "I asssure you, boy, I would attempt thisss I anticipate ssurvival" Quirrell instead Professor Michael "Son, try anything rockets own, I mean anything whatsoever without trained professonal watching, die make Mum sad" Verres-Evans.   "WHAT?" shrieked Amelia mirror.   The wind died bearable level air resistance slowed them, giving Harry plenty opportunity listen buzzing, ringing sound seemed fill whole brain.  Professor Quirrell supposed cast Quieting Charm rocket exhaust... apparently limits Quieting Charms could do... retrospect, Harry Transfigured pair earplugs, trusted Quieting Charm, though probably enough either...  Well, magical healing probably something treat permanent hearing damage.  No, really, magical healing probably something treat that. He'd seen students go Madam Pomfrey injuries sounded lot worse...  Is way transplanting imaginary personality someone else's head? asked Hufflepuff. I want live anymore.  Harry shoved back mind, really anything could right now. Was anything worrying -  Then Harry glanced behind him, remembering first time check whether Bellatrix Professor Quirrell blown broomstick.  But green snake still harness, emaciated woman still clinging broomstick, face still charged unhealthy color eyes still bright dangerous. Her shoulders shaking like laughing hysterically, lips moving though shout, sound coming -  Oh, right.  Harry took hood cloak, tapped ears let know hear.  Whereupon Bellatrix grasped wand, pointed Harry, suddenly ringing ears diminished, could hear her.  A moment later regretted it; imprecations screaming Azkaban, Dementors, Aurors, Dumbledore, Lucius, Bartemy Couch, something called Order Phoenix, stood way Dark Lord, et cetera, suitable younger sensitive listeners; laughter hurting newly healed ears.  "Enough, Bella," Harry finally said, voice stopped instant.  There pause. Harry pulled Cloak back head, general principles; realized instant might telescopes something, retrospect pulling hood even moment incredibly dumb move, hoped whole mission end failing one error...  We're really cut this, we? observed Slytherin.  Hey, Hufflepuff objected sheer reflex, can't expect anything perfectly first time, probably need practice FORGET I SAID THAT.  Harry looked back again, saw Bellatrix looking around puzzled, wondering look face. Her head kept turning, turning.  And finally Bellatrix said, voice lower, "My Lord, we?"  What mean? Harry wanted say, Dark Lord would never admit understanding anything, Harry replied, dryly, "We broomstick."  Does think dead, Heaven?  Bellatrix's hands still chained broomstick, finger came pointed said, "What that?"  Harry followed direction finger saw... nothing particular, actually...  Then Harry realized. After they'd gone high enough, clouds obscure more.  "That Sun, dear Bella."  It came remarkably controlled, Dark Lord sounding perfectly calm maybe little impatient her, even tears started Harry's cheeks.  In endless cold, pitch blackness, Sun would surely been...  A happy memory...  Bellatrix's head kept turning.  "And fluffy things?" said.  "Clouds."  There pause, Bellatrix said, "But they?"  Harry answer her, way voice could steady, would steady, could keep breathing perfectly regular cried.  After while, Bellatrix breathed, softly Harry almost hear, "Pretty..."  Her face slowly relaxed, color leaving paleness almost quickly arrived.  Her skeletal body slumped broomstick.  The borrowed wand dangled lifelessly strap attached unmoving hand.  YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING -  Harry's mind remembered then, Pepper-Up potion came cost; Bellatrix would ssleep conssiderable time, Professor Quirrell said.  And instant another part Harry became utterly convinced, looking back chalk-white emaciated woman, seeming deader bright sunlight anything Harry ever seen alive, dead, uttered last word, Professor Quirrell misjudged dosage -  - deliberately sacrificed Bellatrix guard escape -  Is breathing?  Harry see breathing.  There way, broomstick, reach back take pulse.  Harry looked ahead make sure run flying rocks, kept steering broomstick toward Sun, invisible boy possibly dead woman riding afternoon, fingers gripped wood hard turned white.  He reach back perform artificial respiration.  He use anything healer's kit.  Trust Professor Quirrell endangered her?  Strange, strange, even genuinely believing Professor Quirrell meant kill Auror (for would stupid), thinking Defense Professor's reassurances longer felt reassuring.  Then occurred Harry yet check -  Harry looked back, hissed, "Teacher?"  The snake stir within harness, said word.  ...maybe snake, actual rider, protected acceleration. Or maybe coming close Dementors without shield, even moment Animagus form, knocked Defense Professor.  That good.  It Professor Quirrell told Harry safe use portkey.  Harry steered broomstick whitened fingers, thought, thought hard small unmeasured length time, Bellatrix might might breathing, Professor Quirrell might already not-breathing while.  And Harry decided possible recover error wasting portkey possession, possible recover error letting brain go long without oxygen.  So Harry took next portkey sequence pouch, slowed broomstick halt bright blue air (Harry know, thought it, whether portkey's ability adjust Earth's rotation also included ability match velocity general new surroundings), touched portkey broomstick, and...  Harry paused, still holding twig, mate twig snapped seemed like two weeks ago. He feeling sudden reluctance; brain seemed learned rule, purely neural process negative reinforcement, Snapping Twigs Is A Bad Idea.  But actually logical, Harry snapped twig anyway.   There thunderous boom behind nearby metal door, causing Amelia drop mirror holding spin around wand hand, door burst open reveal Albus Dumbledore, standing front great smoking hole prison wall.  "Amelia," said old wizard. There trace customary levity, eyes hard sapphires beneath half-moon glasses. "I must leave Azkaban I must now. Is faster way broomstick get beyond wards?"  "No -"  "Then I require fastest broomstick, once!"  The place Amelia wanted Auror injured Fiendfyre whatever been.  What needed find Dumbledore knew.  "You!" old witch barked team around her. "Keep clearing corridors bottom, may escaped yet!" And then, old wizard, "Two broomsticks. You brief we're air."  There match stares, long one.   A sickeningly hard yank caught Harry's abdomen, considerably harder yank transported Azkaban, time distance traversed great enough could hear instant silence, watch unseeable space spaces, crack one place another.   The Sun, shone two briefly, swiftly occluded raincloud shot away Azkaban, direction wind faster wind.  "Who's behind it?" shouted Amelia broomstick flying pace away her.  "One two people," Dumbledore said back, "I know not, instant, who. If first, trouble. If second, far greater trouble."  Amelia spare breath sighs. "When know?"  The old wizard's voice grim, quiet yet somehow rising wind. "Three things need perfection, one: The flesh Dark Lord's faithful servant, blood Dark Lord's greatest foe, access certain grave. I thought Harry Potter safe, attempt Azkaban failed - though I still set guards upon - I fearful indeed. They access Time, someone Time-Turner sending messages them; I suspect kidnap attempt Harry Potter already taken place hours ago. Which heard it, Azkaban Time cannot knot itself. That past came future, see."  "And other?" shouted Amelia. What heard already worrying enough; sounded like darkest Dark rituals, centering dead Dark Lord himself.  The old wizard, face even grimmer, said nothing, shook head.   When portkey's yank subsided, Sun peeking horizon, looking like dawn sunset, broom hovered low brief expanse dark-orange rock sand, arranged lumpy hills like someone kneaded land's dough times forgotten roll flat. In near distance, waves rolled past endless vista water, though ground broomstick hovered sea level meters least.  Harry blinked dawn colors, realized portkey international.  "Oy!" came brisk, female shout behind him, Harry spun broomstick look. A middle-aged lady holding one hand mouth deliberate calling gesture, bustling forward. Her kindly features, narrow eyes, umber skin marked race unfamiliar Harry; clad brilliant purple robes style Harry never seen before; lips opened spoke accent Harry place, widely traveled. "Where you? You're two hours late! I almost gave lot you... hello?"  There brief pause. Harry's thoughts seemed moving oddly, slow, everything felt distant, like thick pane glass world, another thick pane glass feelings, could see, touch. It come upon seeing dawn's light kindly witch, thinking seemed like proper end adventure.  Then witch rushing forward drawing wand; muttered word severed cuffs bound emaciated woman broomstick, Bellatrix floated onto sandy rock skeletal arms pale legs dangling like lifeless things. "Oh, Merlin," whispered witch, "Merlin, Merlin, Merlin..."  She appears concerned, thought abstract, distant thing two panes glass. Is real healer would say, someone told put performance would say?  As though Harry spoke, part behind yet another pane glass, whisper came lips. "The green snake back Animagus." Not high whisper, cold, quiet. "He unconscious."  The witch's head twitched up, look voice seemed speak empty air, looked back Bellatrix. "You're Mister Jaffe."  "That would Animagus," whispered Harry's lips. Oh, thought Harry behind glass, listening sound lips, makes sense; Professor Quirrell must used different name.  "Since - bah, forget it." The witch laid wand snake's nose moment, shook head sharply. "Nothing wrong day's rest cure. Her..."  "Can wake now?" whispered Harry's lips. Is good idea? thought Harry, lips definitely seemed think so.  Again sharp headshake. "If Innervate work -" began witch.  "I attempt one," whispered Harry's lips.  "What? Why - oh, never mind. Innervate."  There pause, snake slowly crawled harness. Slowly green head came up, looked around.  A blur later, Professor Quirrell standing, moment later sagged knees.  "Lie down," said witch without looking Bellatrix. "That there, Jeremy?"  "Yes," said Defense Professor rather hoarsely, carefully laid relatively flat patch sandy orange rock. He pale Bellatrix, face bloodless dim dawn light. "Salutations, Miss Camblebunker."  "I told you," said witch, sharpness voice slight smile face, "call Crystal, Britain we'll none formality here. And Doctor now, Miss."  "My apologies, Doctor Camblebunker." This followed dry chuckle.  The witch's smile grew little wider, voice much sharper. "Who's friend?"  "You need know." The Defense Professor's eyes closed, lay ground.  "How wrong go?"  Very dryly indeed: "You read tomorrow newspaper international section."  The witch's wand tapping here, there, poking prodding Bellatrix's body. "I missed you, Jeremy."  "Truly?" said Defense Professor, sounding slightly surprised.  "Not even tiny little bit. If I owe -"  The Defense Professor started laugh, turned coughing fit.  What think? said Slytherin Inner Critic, Harry listened behind glass walls. Performance, reality?  Can't tell, said Harry's Inner Critic. I'm top critical form right now.  Can anyone think good probe gather information? said Ravenclaw.  Again whisper empty air broomstick: "What chance undoing done her?"  "Oh, let's see. Legilimency unknown Dark rituals, ten years set place, followed ten years Dementor exposure? Undo that? You're skull, Mister Whoever-You-Are. The question whether there's anything left, I'd call maybe one chance three -" The witch suddenly cut off. Her voice, spoke again, quieter. "If friend, before... no, never getting back. Best understand now."  I'm voting performance, said Inner Critic. She blurt response one question unless looking opportunity.  Noted, I'm putting low weight confidence that, said Ravenclaw. It's hard let suspicions control perceptions trying weigh evidence subtle.  "What potion give her?" witch said opening Bellatrix's mouth peering inside, wand flashing multiple colors illumination.  The man lying ground calmly said, "Pepper-Up -"  "Were mind?"  Again coughing laugh.  "She'll sleep week lucky," witch said, clucked tongue. "I'll owl opens eyes, I suppose, come back talk Unbreakable Vow. Have got anything stop killing spot, manages even move another month?"  The Defense Professor, eyes still closed, took sheet paper robes; moment later, words began appear it, accompanied tiny wisps smoke. When smoke stopped rising, paper floated toward woman.  The woman looked paper raised eyebrows, gave sardonic snort. "This better work, Jeremy, last testament says whole estate goes putting bounty head. Speaking -"  The Defense Professor reached robes tossed witch bag made clinking sound. The witch caught it, weighed it, made pleased sound.  Then stood up, pale skeletal woman floated ground beside her. "I'm heading back," said witch. "I can't start work here."  "Wait," said Defense Professor, gesture retrieved wand Bellatrix's hand harness. Then hand pointed wand Bellatrix, moved small circular gesture, accompanied quiet, "Obliviate."  "That's it," snapped witch, "I'm taking anyone damage -" One arm came around hug bony form Bellatrix Black side, disappeared loud POP! Apparition.  And silence lumpy place, gentle rush passing waves, little breath wind.  I think performance finished, said Inner Critic. I give two half five stars. She's probably experienced actor.  I wonder real healer would seem fake actor told play one? mused Ravenclaw.     Like watching television show, felt, like watching television show whose characters particularly empathize with, could seen felt behind glass walls.  Somehow, Harry managed move lips himself, send voice still dawn air, surprised hear question. "How many different people you, anyway?"  The pale man lying ground laugh, broomstick Harry's eyes saw sides Professor Quirrell's lips curling up, edge familiar sardonic smile. "I cannot say I bothered keeping count. How many you?"  It shaken inner Harry much, hearing response, yet felt - felt - unstable, like center subtracted -  Oh.  "Excuse me," said Harry's voice. It sounded distant detached fading Harry felt. "I'm going faint seconds, I think."  "Use fourth portkey I gave you, one I said fallback refuge," said man lying ground, calmly swiftly. "It safer there. And continue wearing cloak."  Harry's free hand retrieved another twig pouch snapped it.  There another portkey yank, internationally long, somewhere black.  "Lumos," said Harry's lips, part looking safety whole.  He inside looked like Muggle warehouse, deserted one.  Harry's legs climbed broomstick, lay floor. His eyes closed, tidy fraction self willed light fail, darkness took him.   "Where go?" yelled Amelia. They almost edge wards.  "Backward time protect Harry Potter," said old wizard, Amelia could even open lips ask wanted help, felt boundary wards crossed them.  There pop Apparition, wizard phoenix vanished, leaving behind borrowed broomstick.   Chapter 60: The Stanford Prison Experiment, Pt 10  "Wake."  Harry's eyes flew open came awake choking gasp, jerking start prone body. He remember dreams, maybe brain exhausted dream, seemed like he'd closed eyes heard word spoken moment after.  "You must awaken," said voice Quirinus Quirrell. "I gave much time I could, would wise reserve least one use Time-Turner. Soon must go backward four hours Mary's Place, appearing every way though done nothing interesting day. I wished speak then."  Harry slowly sat midst darkness. His body ached, places laid hard concrete. Images tumbled memory, everything unconscious brain tired discharge proper nightmare.  Twelve terrible voids floating metal corridor, tarnishing metal around them, light dimmed temperature falling emptiness tried suck life world -  Chalk-white skin, stretched bone remained fat muscle faded -  A metal door -  A woman's voice -  No, I mean it, please die -  I can't remember children's names -  Don't go, take away, don't -  "What place?" Harry said hoarsely, voice pushed throat like water forced too-thin pipe, darkness sounded almost shattered Bellatrix Black's voice been. "What place? That prison, HELL!"  "Hell?" said calm voice Defense Professor. "You mean Christian punishment fantasy? I suppose similarity."  "How -" Harry's voice blocking, something huge lodged throat. "How - could -" People built place, someone made Azkaban, they'd made purpose, they'd done deliberately, woman, she'd children, children remember, judge decided happen her, someone needed drag cell lock door screamed, someone fed every day walked away without letting -  "HOW COULD PEOPLE DO THAT?"  "Why they?" said Defense Professor. A pale blue light lit warehouse, then, showing high, cavernous concrete ceiling, dusty concrete floor; Professor Quirrell sitting distance away Harry, leaning back painted wall; pale blue light turned walls glacier surfaces, dust floor speckled snow, man become ice sculpture, shrouded darkness black robes lay him. "What use prisoners Azkaban them?"  Harry's mouth opened croak. No words exited.  A faint smile twitched Defense Professor's lips. "You know, Mr. Potter, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named come rule magical Britain, built place Azkaban, would built enjoyed seeing enemies suffer. And instead began find suffering distasteful, why, would order Azkaban torn next day. As make Azkaban, tear down, preaching lofty sermons imagining villains... well, Mr. Potter, I think I choice taking tea them, taking tea You-Know-Who, I find sensibilities less offended Dark Lord."  "I understand," Harry said, voice shaking, he'd read classic experiment psychology prisons, ordinary college students turned sadistic soon assigned role prison guards; realized experiment examined right question, one important question, looked key people, prison guards everyone else, "I really understand, Professor Quirrell, people stand let happen, country magical Britain -" Harry's voice stopped.  The Defense Professor's eyes appeared color always, pale blue light, light color Quirinus Quirrell's irises, never-thawing chips ice. "Welcome, Mr. Potter, first encounter realities politics. What wretched creatures Azkaban offer faction? Who would benefit aiding them? A politician openly sided would associate criminals, weakness, distasteful things people would rather think about. Alternatively, politician could demonstrate might cruelty calling longer sentences; make display strength requires victim crush beneath you, all. And populace applauds, instinct back winner." A coldly amused laugh. "You see, Mr. Potter, one ever quite believes go Azkaban, see harm themselves. As inflict others... I suppose told people care sort thing? It lie, Mr. Potter, people care slightest, led vastly sheltered childhood would noticed long ago. Console this: prisoner Azkaban voted Ministers Magic pledged move cells closer Dementors. I admit, Mr. Potter, I see little hope democracy effective form government, I admire poetry makes victims complicit destruction."  Harry's recently cohered self threatening shatter fragments again, words falling like hammerstrikes consciousness, driving back, step step, precipice lurked vast abyss; trying find something save himself, clever retort would refute words, come.  The Defense Professor watched Harry, gaze reflecting curiosity command. "It simple, Mr. Potter, understand Azkaban built, continues be. Men care they, themselves, expect suffer gain; long expect redound upon themselves, cruelty carelessness without limit. All wizards country different within sought rule them, You-Know-Who; lack power his... frankness."  The boy's hands clenched fists tightly nails cut palm, fingers white face pale seen that, dim blue light cast ice shadow. "You offered support ambition next Dark Lord. Is why, Professor?"  The Defense Professor inclined head, thin smile lips. "Learn I teach you, Mr. Potter, rule country time. Then may tear prison democracy made, find Azkaban still offends sensibilities. Like not, Mr. Potter, seen day conflicts country's populace, bow head submit decision occurs. So them, whether know it, whether acknowledge it, next Dark Lord."  In monochromatic light, unwavering, boy Defense Professor seemed like motionless ice sculptures, irises eyes reduced similar colors, looking much light.  Harry stared directly pale eyes. All long-suppressed questions, ones he'd told putting hold Ides May. That lie, Harry knew, self-deception, kept silent fear might hear. And everything coming forth lips, once. "On first day class, tried convince classmates I killer."  "You are." Amusedly. "But question I told that, Mr. Potter, answer find ambiguity great ally road power. Give sign Slytherin one day, contradict sign Gryffindor next; Slytherins enabled believe wish, Gryffindors argue supporting well. So long uncertainty, people believe whatever seems to advantage. And long appear strong, long appear winning, instincts tell advantage lies you. Walk always shadow, light darkness follow."  "And," said boy, voice level, "just want this?"  Professor Quirrell leaned back wall sat, casting face shadow, eyes changing pale ice dark pits like snake form. "I wish Britain grow strong strong leader; desire. As reasons why," Professor Quirrell smiled without mirth, "I think shall stay own."  "The sense doom I feel around you." The words becoming harder harder say, subject danced closer closer something terrible forbidden. "You always knew meant."  "I several guesses," said Professor Quirrell, expression unreadable. "And I yet say I guessed. But much I tell you: doom flares come near, mine."  For Harry's brain managed mark questionable assertion possible lie, instead believing everything heard. "Why sometimes turn zombie?"  "Personal reasons," said Professor Quirrell humor voice.  "What ulterior motive rescuing Bellatrix?"  There brief silence, Harry tried hard control breathing, keep steady.  Finally Defense Professor shrugged, though account. "I spelled you, Mr. Potter. I told everything needed deduce answer, mature enough consider first obvious question. Bellatrix Black Dark Lord's powerful servant, loyalty assured; single person likely entrusted part lost lore Slytherin yours."  Slowly anger crept Harry, slowly wrath, something terrible beginning boil blood, moments would say something really say two alone deserted warehouse -  "But innocent," said Defense Professor. He smiling. "And degree choices taken away her, never chance suffer mistakes... struck excessive, Mr. Potter. If tells nothing use -" The Defense Professor gave another small shrug. "I shall consider day's work waste."  "How altruistic you," Harry said coldly. "So wizards like You-Know-Who inside, exception that, then?"  The Defense Professor's eyes still shadow, dark pits could met. "Call whim, Mr. Potter. It sometimes amused play part hero. Who knows You-Know-Who would say same."  Harry opened mouth final time -  And found say it, ask last question, last important question, make words come out. Even though refusal like forbidden rationalist, he'd ever recited Litany Tarski Litany Gendlin sworn whatever could destroyed truth be, one moment, could bring say last question loud. Even though knew thinking wrongly, even though knew supposed better this, still say it.  "Now turn inquire you." Professor Quirrell's back straightened leaned back glacier wall painted concrete. "I wondering, Mr. Potter, anything say nearly killing ruining mutual endeavor. I given understand apology, cases, considered sign respect. But offered one. Is yet gotten around it, Mr. Potter?"  The tone calm, quiet edge fine sharp would slice way realized murdered.  And Harry looked Defense Professor cool eyes would never flinch anything; even death, now. He longer Azkaban, longer fearful part fearless; solid gemstone Harry rotated meet stress, turning smoothly one facet another, light darkness, warm cold.  A calculated ploy part, make feel guilty, put position I must submit?  Genuine emotion part?  "I see," said Professor Quirrell. "I suppose answers -"  "No," said boy cool, collected voice, "you get frame conversation easily, Professor. I went considerable lengths protect get Azkaban safely, I thought tried kill police officer. That included facing twelve Dementors without Patronus Charm. I wonder, I apologized demanded it, would said thank-you turn? Or I correct thinking submission demanded there, respect?"  There pause, Professor Quirrell's voice came reply, openly icy danger longer veiled. "It seems still cannot bring lose, Mr. Potter."  Darkness stared Harry's eyes without flinching, Defense Professor reduced mortal thing within them. "Oh, pondering now, whether pretend lose me, pretend humble anger, order preserve plans? Did thought calculated false apology even cross mind? Me neither, Professor Quirrell."  The Defense Professor laughed, low humorless, emptier void stars, dangerous vacuum filled hard radiation. "No, Mr. Potter, learned lesson, all."  "I thought losing many times, Azkaban," said boy, voice level. "That I ought simply give up, turn Aurors. Losing would sensible thing do. I heard voice saying me, mind; I would done it, I myself. But I could bring lose you."  There silence, then, time; though even Defense Professor could quite think say that.  "I curious," said Professor Quirrell last. "What think I apologize for, precisely? I gave explicit instructions event fight. You stay down, stay way, cast magic. You violated instructions brought mission."  "I made decision," boy said evenly, "there choice it, wish Auror die, Patronus there. For wish never occurred, warned might bluff using Killing Curse. By default, I assume point wand someone say Avada Kedavra, want dead. Shouldn't first rule Unforgivable Curse Safety?"  "Rules duels," said Defense Professor. Some coldness returned voice. "And dueling sport, branch Battle Magic. In real fight, curse cannot blocked must dodged indispensable tactic. I would thought obvious you, seems I misjudged intellect."  "It also seems imprudent," said boy, continuing though spoken, "to tell casting spell might kill us both. What suffered mishap, I tried Innervate, Hover Charm? That ignorance, permitted purposes I cannot guess, played also part catastrophe."  There another silence. The Defense Professor's eyes narrowed, faintly puzzled look face, though encountered completely unfamiliar situation; still man spoke word.  "Well," said boy. His eyes wavered Defense Professor's. "I certainly regret hurting you, Professor. But I think situation calls submit you. I never really understand concept apology, still less applies situation like this; regrets, submission, count saying sorry?"  Again cold, cold laugh, darker void stars.  "I know," said Defense Professor, "I, too, never understood concept apology. That ploy would futile us, seems, us knowing lie. Let us speak it, then. Debts settled us time."  There silence time.  "By way," said boy. "Hermione Granger would never built Azkaban, matter going put it. And she'd die hurt innocent. Just mentioning that, since said wizards like You-Know-Who inside, that's false point simple fact. Would've realized earlier I been," boy gave brief grim smile, "stressed out."  The Defense Professor's eyes half-lidded, expression distant. "People's insides always like outsides, Mr. Potter. Perhaps simply wishes others think good girl. She cannot use Patronus Charm -"  "Hah," said boy; smile seemed realer now, warmer. "She's trouble exactly reason I did. There's enough light destroy Dementors, I'm sure. She able stop destroying Dementors, even cost life..." The boy trailed off, voice resumed. "I might good person, maybe; exist, one them."  Dryly. "She young, make show kindness costs little."  There pause this. Then boy said, "Professor, I ask, see something dark gloomy, ever occur to try improve somehow? Like, yes, something goes terribly wrong people's heads makes think great torture criminals, mean they're truly evil inside; maybe taught right things, showed wrong, could change -"  Professor Quirrell laughed, then, emptiness before. "Ah, Mr. Potter, sometimes I forget young are. Sooner could change color sky." Another chuckle, one colder. "And reason easy forgive fools think well them, Mr. Potter, sorely hurt. You think less fondly commonplace idiots first time folly costs something dear. Such hundred Galleons pocket, perhaps, rather agonizing deaths hundred strangers." The Defense Professor smiling thinly. He took pocket-watch robes, looked it. "Let us depart now, nothing say us."  "You questions impossible things I get us Azkaban?"  "No," said Defense Professor. "I believe I solved already. As rest, rare I find person I cannot see immediately, friend foe. I shall unravel puzzles myself, due time."  The Defense Professor shoved up, pushing back wall hands rising feet, smoothly slowly. The boy, less gracefully, same.  And boy blurted last terrible question earlier unable ask; though say aloud would make real, though not, already, vastly obvious.  "Why I like children age?"   In deserted side-road Diagon Alley, scraps un-Vanished trash could seen lodged edges brick street blank brick building-sides surrounded it, along scattered dirt signs neglect, ancient wizard phoenix Apparated existence.  The wizard already reaching within robes hourglass when, habit, eyes jumped random spot road wall, memorize -  And old wizard blinked surprise; scrap parchment spot.  A frown crossed Albus Dumbledore's face took step forward took crumpled scrap, unfolding it.  On single word "NO", nothing more.  Slowly wizard let flutter fingers. Absently reached pavement, picked nearest scrap parchment, looked remarkably similar one taken; touched wand, moment later inscribed word "NO", handwriting, own.  The old wizard planned go back three hours Harry Potter first arrived Diagon Alley. He already watched, upon instruments, boy leaving Hogwarts, could undone (his one attempt fool instruments, control Time without altering appearance himself, ended sufficient disaster convince never try trickery). He hoped retrieve boy first possible moment arrival, take another safe location, Hogwarts (for instruments shown boy's return). But -  "A paradox I retrieve immediately arrives Diagon Alley?" murmured old wizard himself. "Perhaps set motion plan rob Azkaban, confirmed arrival here... else... perhaps..."   Painted concrete, hard floor distant ceilings, two figures facing across other. One entity wore shape man late thirties already balding, another mind wore form eleven-year-old boy scar upon forehead. Ice shadow, pale blue light.  "I know," said man.  The boy looked him. And said, "Oh, really?"  "Truly," said man. "I know nothing, guesses I speak. Yet I say much -"   Chapter 61: TSPE, Secrecy Openness, Pt 11  Through green flame whirled, Floo network spun, Minerva's heart racing pounding horror felt ten years three months, corridors space coughed spit lobby Gringotts (the safest Floo receiver Diagon Alley, connection difficult intercept, fastest way Hogwarts without phoenix). A goblin attendant turned toward them, eyes widened, began slightly respectful bow -  Determination, Destination, Deliberation!  And two alley back Mary's Place, wands already raised, spinning around back-to-back words Anti-Disillusionment Charm already rising Severus's lips.  The alley empty.  When turned back look Severus, wand already cracking head sound like smashing egg, lips chanted words invisibility; took colors surroundings, became blur surroundings, blur moved matched behind nothing there.  She lowered wand stepped forward receive Disillusionment -  From behind her, unmistakable sound burst flame.  She spun saw Albus there, long wand already drawn raised right hand. His eyes grim beneath half-circles glasses, Fawkes upon shoulder spread fire-colored wings readiness flight fight.  "Albus!" said. "I thought -" She'd seen depart Azkaban, she'd thought even phoenixes could return easily.  Then realized.  "She escaped," said Albus. "Did Patronus reach him?"  The pounding heart grew stronger, horror veins solidified. "He said here, washroom -"  "Let us hope spoke true," said Albus, wand tapped head sensation like water trickling her, moment later four (even Fawkes rendered invisible, though sometimes saw flicker something like fire air) racing front restaurant. They paused door Albus whispered something, moment later one customers visible windows stood vague look face opened door though taking quick look outside friend; three through, racing past unwitting customers (Severus marking faces, Minerva knew, Albus would see Disillusioned) toward sign pointed washroom -  An old wooden door marked sign toilet burst open slam, four invisible rescuers stormed it.  The small clean wooden room empty, fresh droplets water showed sink sign Harry, sheet paper left closed lid toilet.  She breathe.  The sheet paper rose air Albus took it, moment later thrust direction.  M: What hat tell tell you?   - H  "Ah," Minerva said aloud surprise, mind taking moment place question, sort thing forget thinking mode, really - "I'm impudent youngster I get lawn."  "Eh?" said air Albus's voice, even could shocked.  And Harry Potter's head appeared, suspended next air beside toilet, face cold alert, too-adult Harry she'd seen sometimes, eyes darting back forth around.  "What's going -" boy began.  Albus, visible along Fawkes, moving forward instant, left hand reached forward plucked hair Harry's head (producing startled yelp boy), Minerva accepted hair hand, moment later Albus swept mostly-invisible boy arms flash red-golden fire.  And Harry Potter safe.  Minerva took steps forward, leaned wall Albus Harry been, trying recover poise.  She'd... lost habits, ten years since Order Phoenix disbanded.  Beside her, Severus shimmered visibility. His right hand already drawing forth flask robes, left hand already stretching forth demand. She gave Harry's hair, moment later, dropped flask unfinished Polyjuice, began fizzing bubbling settled potency would enable Severus act part bait.  "That unexpected," Potions Master said slowly. "Why Headmaster retrieve Mr. Potter earlier, I wonder, going far twist Time? There nothing preventing so... indeed, Patronus found Mr. Potter already safe..."  She thought that, different realization jumped forefront mind. It nearly horrifying Bellatrix Black escaped Azkaban, still -  "Harry invisibility cloak?" said.  The Potions Master answer; shrinking.   Tick-snick, drip-blip, ding-ring-ting-  It still annoyed her, though faded past attention while; became Headmistress, intended Silence whole lot. Which Head Hogwarts, wondered, first inconsiderate create device made noise, pass successors?  She sitting Headmaster's office quickly Transfigured desk own, hundred little pieces necessary paperwork kept Hogwarts grinding halt; could lose easily, prevented thinking things. Albus remarked, sounding rather wry, Hogwarts seemed run even smoothly outside crisis avoid thinking about...  ...ten years ago, last time Albus said that.  There chime indicated approaching visitor.  Minerva kept reading current parchment.  The door slammed open, revealing Severus Snape, took three steps inward demanded without slightest pause, "Any word Mad-Eye?"  Albus already rising chair, even tucked away parchments dispelled desk. "Moody's Patronus reporting Azkaban," Albus said. "His Eye saw nothing; Eye Vance see thing, thing exist. Yourself?"  "No one tried forcibly take blood," Severus said. He gave quick grimace smile. "Except Defense Professor."  "What?" said Minerva.  "He saw impostor I could even open lips, quite reasonably attacked spot, demanding know whereabouts Mr. Potter." Another grimace smile. "Shouting I Severus Snape seem reassure him, reason. I believe man would kill Sickle give back five Knuts change. I stun good Professor Quirrell, easy, reacted poorly hex. 'Harry Potter', naturally alarmed, ran told owner, Defense Professor taken St. Mungos -"  "St. Mungos?"  "- said probably overworking weeks collapsed, state exhaustion. Your precious Defense Professor fine, Minerva, stunner may helped forcing take days off. Afterward I declined offer Floo Hogwarts, went back Diagon Alley wandered; one seems wanted Mr. Potter's blood today."  "Our Defense Professor best hands, I sure," said Albus. "Greater matters command attention, Minerva."  It took considerable effort wrench attention back, sat back down, Severus gestured chair well, three drew together begin council.  She felt like Polyjuiced impostor, sitting two. War art, plotting. She strain keep one step ahead Weasley twins, sometimes failed that. She sitting here, ultimately, heard prophecy...  "We faced," Headmaster spoke first, "with rather alarming mystery. I think two wizards might engineered escape."  Minerva drew breath sharply. "There chance You-Know-Who?"  "I'm afraid so," said Headmaster.  She glanced side saw Severus looked puzzled herself. Afraid Dark Lord rising again? She would given almost anything true.  "So," Albus said heavily. "Our first suspect Voldemort, risen seeking resurrect himself. I studied many books I wish I read, seeking every possible avenue return, I found three. His strongest road life Philosopher's Stone, Flamel assures even Voldemort could create own; road would rise greater terrible ever before. I would thought Voldemort able resist temptation Stone, still less obvious trap challenge wit. But second avenue nearly strong: The flesh servant, willingly given; blood foe, forcibly taken; bone ancestor, unknowingly bequeathed. Voldemort perfectionist -" Albus glanced Severus, nodded agreement, "- would certainly seek powerful combination: flesh Bellatrix Black, blood Harry Potter, bone father. Voldemort's final avenue seduce victim drain life long period; case Voldemort would weak compared former power. His motive spirit away Bellatrix clear. And keeping reserve, use case cannot attain Stone, would explain kidnap attempt made Harry day."  Minerva glanced Severus, saw listening attentively without surprise.  "What clear," Headmaster continued, "is Voldemort could engineered escape. A death doll left Bellatrix's place, escape meant undetected; even though went wrong, Dementors could find first warning. Azkaban stood impenetrable centuries, I cannot imagine means Voldemort could accomplished this."  "That may mean little," Severus said, expressionless. "For Dark Lord cannot imagine requires better imagination."  Albus nodded grimly. "Unfortunately another wizard laughs impossibilities. A wizard who, long ago, developed new powerful Charm could blinded Dementors Bellatrix Black's escape. And implicated reasons, well."  Minerva's heart skipping beats, know how, why, terrible apprehension dawning -  "Who would be?" said Severus, sounding puzzled.  Albus leaned back said fatal words, even feared them: "Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres."  "Potter?" demanded Potions Master, much shock usually-silken voice ever heard him. "Headmaster, one jokes? He first year Hogwarts! A temper tantrum childish pranks invisibility cloak make -"  "It joke," said Minerva, voice barely whisper. "Harry already making original discoveries Transfiguration, Severus. Though I know researching Charms well."  "Harry ordinary first-year," Headmaster said solemnly. "He marked Dark Lord's equal, power Dark Lord knows not."  Severus looking her, would needed know well recognize glance pleading. "Am I take seriously?"  Minerva simply nodded.  "Does anyone else know this... new powerful Charm?" Severus demanded.  The Headmaster glanced apologetically -  Somehow knew, knew even said it, wanted scream top lungs.  - said, "Quirinus Quirrell."  "Why," said, voice melted half devices office, "did Mr. Potter even TELL Defense Professor brilliant new Charm breaking prisons -"  The Headmaster passed weary wrinkled hand across equally wrinkled forehead. "Quirinus happened there, Minerva. Even I saw harm time." The Headmaster hesitated. "And Harry said Charm dangerous explained either us; I asked again, day, insisted still explained Quirinus, ever dropped Occlumency barriers Defense Professor's presence -"  "Mr. Potter Occlumens? You gave invisibility cloak immune Veritaserum friends Weasley twins? Albus, idea unleashed upon school?" Her voice nearly shrieking, now. "By seventh year anything left Hogwarts smoking hole ground!"  Albus leaned back great cushioned chair, said, smiling, "Don't forget Time-Turner."  She scream then, quietly.  Severus drawled, "Should I teach brew Polyjuice, Headmaster? I ask sake completeness, case satisfied magnitude pet disaster."  "Perhaps next year," said Albus. "My dearest friends, question us whether Harry Potter spirited Bellatrix Black Azkaban, youthful high spirits even tolerant standards."  "Excuse me, Headmaster," Severus said one dryer smiles ever seen deliver Albus, "but I register opinion answer no. This Dark Lord's work, pure simple."  "Then why," Albus said, humor voice, "when I planned retrieve Harry immediately arrival Diagon Alley, I find would result paradox?"  Minerva sank back chair, dropped left elbow onto hard uncushioned armrest, leaned head hand, shut eyes despair.  There narrowly circulated proverb effect one Auror thirty qualified investigate cases involving Time-Turners; few, half already insane, soon would be.  "So suspect," Severus's voice saying, "that Potter went Diagon Alley Azkaban, looped back Diagon Alley afterward picked us -"  "Precisely," said Albus's voice. "Though also possible Voldemort servants watched make sure Harry arrive Diagon Alley, began attempt Azkaban. And someone Time-Turner would send back message success, trigger abduction. Indeed, suspicion possibility caused dispatch Minerva mission, I went Azkaban. I thought breakout would fail, retrieving Harry Potter meant observing fact eventual failure, I could gone Azkaban I interacted him, Azkaban's future cannot touch past. When, Azkaban, I received report Minerva, Flitwick I told try contacting you, I knew interaction Harry Potter interaction Azkaban's future, meaning someone sending messages Time -"  Then Albus's voice stopped.  "But Headmaster," said Severus, "you came back Azkaban's future interacted us..."  The Potions Master's voice trailed off.  "But Severus, I received reports Minerva Harry's safety, I would not, first place, gone backward time -"  "Headmaster, I think must draw diagrams this."  "I agree, Severus."  There sound parchment spread table, quills scratching, arguing.  Minerva sat chair, head resting hand, eyes shut.  There story she'd heard criminal possessed Time-Turner Department Mysteries sealed him, case extremely bad judgment needed one; Auror assigned track unknown time-criminal, also given Time-Turner; story ended St. Mungo's ward Total Unrecoverable Nutcases.  Minerva sat eyes shut, trying listen, trying think it, trying go insane.  After awhile, argument seemed wound down, said aloud, "Mr. Potter's Time-Turner restricted hours nine PM midnight. Was shell tampered with, Albus?"  "Not discerning Charms," said Albus. "But shells new things; defeat Unspeakables' precautions leave trace defeat... might impossible."  She opened eyes, saw Severus Headmaster staring intently parchment covered tangled squiggles would doubt driven mad comprehend.  "Have come conclusions?" Minerva said. "And please tell arrived them."  Severus Headmaster looked other, turned look her.  "We concluded," Headmaster said gravely, "that either Harry involved not; either Voldemort access Time-Turner not; regardless could happened within Azkaban, nobody would visited Little Hangleton graveyard period Moody already watched within past."  "In short," Severus drawled, "we know nothing, dear Minerva; though seems least likely another Time-Turner involved, somehow. My suspicion Potter bribed, tricked, threatened conveying messages backward time, perhaps even regarding prison break. I shall make obvious suggestion pulling strings. But I suggest nine o' clock tonight, test whether Potter able travel full six hours backward three o' clock, see yet used Time-Turner."  "That seems wise case," said Dumbledore. "See done, Minerva, tell Harry stop office convenience, afterward."  "But still suspect Harry direct involvement prison break itself?" Minerva said.  "Possible unlikely," said Severus, time Albus said, "Yes."  Minerva pinched bridge nose, took deep breath, let out. "Albus, Severus, possible reason Mr. Potter thing!"  "None I think of," said Albus, "but remains Harry's magics alone, means known me, might -"  "Hold," said Severus. All expression vanished face. "A thought occurs me, I must check -" The Potions Master seized pinch Floo powder, strode across room toward fireplace - Albus hastily waved wand light - flare green flame, words "Slytherin Head House office", Severus gone.  She Albus looked shrugged; Albus turned back studying parchment.  It minutes later Severus spun back Floo, brushing traces ash himself.  "Well," said Potions Master. Again expressionless face. "I afraid Mr. Potter motive."  "Speak!" said Albus.  "I found Lesath Lestrange Slytherin common room, studying," Severus said. "He reluctant meet eyes. And seems Mr. Lestrange like think parents Azkaban, cold darkness, Dementors sucking away life, hurting every second every day, told Mr. Potter many words, begged get out. Since, see, Mr. Lestrange heard Boy-Who-Lived could anything."  She Albus exchanged glances.  "Severus," Minerva said, "surely... even Harry... common sense that..."  Her voice trailed off.  "Mr. Potter thinks God," Severus said without expression, "and Lesath Lestrange fell knees heartfelt cry prayer."  Minerva stared Severus, feeling sick stomach. She studied Muggle religion - common reason needing Memory-Charm parents Muggleborns - knew enough understand Severus said.  "In case," said Potions Master. "I looked within Mr. Lestrange see knew anything mother's escape. He heard nothing. But instant learns, conclude person responsible Harry Potter."  "I see..." Albus said slowly. "Thank you, Severus. That good news."  "Good news?" Minerva burst out.  Albus looked her, face expressionless Severus's, now; remembered, shock, Albus's - "It best reason I possibly imagine removing Bellatrix Azkaban," Albus said quietly. "And Harry, let us recall, certainly Voldemort making first moves. But let us hasty judgment much yet know, soon will."  Albus stood behind desk, strode fireplace still alight, cast another pinch green powder, stuck head flames. "Department Magical Law Enforcement," said, "Director's office."  After moment, voice Madam Bones came clear sharp, "What it, Albus? I somewhat busy."  "Amelia," said Albus, "I beg share discoveries made concerning matter."  There pause. "Oh," said cold voice Madam Bones blazing fire, "and two-way road then, Albus?"  "It may be," old wizard said calmly.  "If Auror dies reticence, old meddler, I hold responsible full measure."  "I understand, Amelia," Albus said, "but I wish spark needless alarm incredulity -"  "Bellatrix Black escaped Azkaban! What alarm incredulity think I call needless, face that?"  "I may call remember words," said old wizard green flames. "For I learn fears needless, I tell you. Now, Amelia, I beg you, learned anything whatsoever upon matter, please share it."  There another pause, Madam Bones's voice said, "I information I learned four hours future, Albus. Do still want it?"  Albus paused -  (weighing, Minerva knew, possibility might want go back two hours instant; send information back time six hours, chain Time-Turners)  - finally said, "Yes, please."  "We lucky break," said Madam Bones's voice, "one Aurors witnessed escape Muggleborn, told us Flying-Fire spell, calling it, might spell all, Muggle artifact."  Like punch stomach, felt, sickness Minerva's belly redoubled. Anyone who'd watched Chaos Legion battle knew whose hand showed...  Madam Bones's voice continued. "We brought Arthur Weasley Misuse Muggle Artifacts - knows Muggle artifacts wizard alive - gave descriptions Aurors scene, cracked it. It Muggle artifact called rocker, call rocker ride one. Just six years ago one rockers blew up, killed hundreds Muggles flash almost set fire Moon. Weasley says rockers use special kind science called opposite reaction, plan develop jinx prevent science working around Azkaban."  "Thank you, Amelia," Albus said gravely. "Is everything?"  "I'll check anything six hours forward," said voice Madam Bones, "if told me, I'll tell you. Do anything want tell me, Albus? Which two possibilities looking like?"  "Not yet, Amelia," Albus said, "but I may word soon."  He straightened fire, then, faded back ordinary yellow flames. Every minute old wizard's years, every natural second since birth every second Time-Turning added, plus extra decades stress, visible lined face.  "Severus?" old wizard said. "What actually?"  "A rocket," said half-blood Potions Master, grown Muggle town Spinner's End. "One impressive Muggle technologies."  "How likely Harry know arts?" said Minerva.  Severus drawled, "Oh, boy like Mr. Potter knows rockets; that, dear Minerva, certainty. You must remember things done differently Muggle world." Severus frowned. "But rockets dangerous, expensive..."  "Harry stolen hidden unknown amount money Gringotts vault, perhaps thousands Galleons," said Headmaster, then, twin stares, "That plan, I made mistake sending Defense Professor supervise Harry's withdrawal five Galleons Christmas presents..." The Headmaster shrugged. "Yes, I agree, sheer folly retrospect, let us continue."  Minerva quietly thudded head times headrest chair.  "Nonetheless, Headmaster," Severus said. "Just Death Eaters never used Muggle artifacts first war, mean ignorant. Rockets fell Britain weapons, Muggle side Grindelwald's war. If spent summers years Muggle orphanage, told us, Headmaster... he, too, heard rockets. And listening reports Mr. Potter mock battles using Muggle artifacts, would certainly learn enemy's strengths try redouble himself. That thinks; power sees try take own."  The old wizard standing stock still, utterly motionless, even hairs beard frozen place like solid wires; thought came Minerva, frightening thought she'd ever had, Albus Dumbledore rooted spot horror.  "Severus," Albus Dumbledore said, voice almost cracked, "do realize saying? If Harry Potter Voldemort fight war Muggle weapons nothing left world fire!"  "What?" said Minerva. She heard guns, course, dangerous experienced witch -  Severus spoke though room. "Then perhaps, Headmaster, sending deliberate warning Harry Potter exactly that; saying attack Muggle weapons met retaliation kind. Command Mr. Potter cease use Muggle technology battles; show message received... give ideas." Severus frowned. "Though, come think it, Mr. Malfoy - course Miss Granger - well, second thought blanket prohibition technology seems wiser -"  The old wizard pressed hands forehead, lips came unsteady voice, "I begin hope Harry behind escape... oh, Merlin defend us all, I done, I done, become world?"  Severus shrugged. "From rumors I heard, Headmaster, Muggle weapons slightly worse more... recondite aspects wizardry -"  "Worse?" gasped Minerva, shut mouth though force.  "Worse peril left fading years," said Albus. "Not worse erased Atlantis Time."  Minerva stared him, feeling sweat break along spine.  Severus continued, still addressing Albus. "All Death Eaters save Bellatrix would betrayed him, supporters turned him, powers world converged destroy him, reckless truly dangerous potency. Is different, then?"  Some motion, color, returned old wizard's face. "Perhaps not..."  "And case," Severus said slightly condescending smile, "Muggle weapons easy obtain, thousand Galleons thousand thousand."  Doesn't Harry Transfigure devices uses battles? thought Minerva, could open mouth ask -  The fireplace erupted green flames, then, face Pius Thicknesse, Madam Bones's assistant, appeared therein. "Chief Warlock?" said Thicknesse. "I report you, transmitted -" Thicknesse's eyes flickered Minerva Severus, "six minutes ago."  "Six hours ahead, mean," said Albus. "These two meant hear it; deliver report."  "We know done," said Thicknesse. "In Bellatrix Black's cell, hidden one corner, potions vial; testing traces remaining fluid shows Animagus potion."  There long pause.  "I see..." Albus said heavily.  "Pardon me?" said Minerva. She didn't.  Thicknesse's head turned toward her. "Animagi, Madam McGonagall, Animagus forms, less interest Dementors. All prisoners tested arrival Azkaban; Animagi, Animagus form destroyed. But considered someone protected Patronus Charm taking potion performing meditation, might able become Animagus went Azkaban -"  "I understood," Severus said, put customary sneer, "that Animagus meditation required considerable time."  "Well, Mr. Snape," Thicknesse barked, "records show Bellatrix Black Animagus sentenced Azkaban form destroyed; maybe second meditation take much time first!"  "I would thought possible prisoner Azkaban thing..." Albus said. "But Bellatrix Black powerful sorceress incarceration, might done witch could. Can Azkaban secured method?"  "Yes," said confident head Pius Thicknesse. "Our expert says nigh-unimaginable Animagus meditation could performed less three hours, regardless experience. All visits prisoners allowed receive limited two hours henceforth, Dementors inform us Patronus Charm maintained prison areas longer that."  Albus looked unhappy that, nodded. "I see. There attempts sort, course, relax vigilance. And Amelia told this, tell I information her."  The head Pius Thicknesse vanished without another word.  "No attempts...?" said Minerva.  "Because, dear Minerva," Severus drawled, quite taken habitual sneer, "if Dark Lord planned free servants Azkaban, would left behind vial potion tell us done." Severus frowned. "I confess... even I see vial left there."  "It kind message..." Albus said slowly. "And I cannot see means, all..." He drummed fingers desk.  For long minute three, old wizard stared nothingness, frowning; Severus also sat silence.  Then Albus shook head dismay, said, "Severus, comprehend this?"  "No," said Potions Master, sardonic smile, "which probably better us; whatever intended conclude it, part plan misfired."  "You certain, now, You-Know... Voldemort?" said Minerva. "It could Death Eater conceived clever notion?"  "And knew rockets, too?" Severus said dryly. "I believe Death Eaters fond Muggle Studies. It he."  "Aye, he," Albus said. "Azkaban endured impenetrable ages, fall ordinary Animagus potion. It clever impossible, ever Voldemort's signature since days known Tom Riddle. Anyone wished forge signature must needs cunning Voldemort so. And one else world would accidentally overestimate wit, leave message I cannot understand all."  "Unless gauged exactly," Severus said tonelessly, "in case intended think."  Albus sighed. "Indeed. But even tricked perfectly, may least rely conclusion Harry Potter."  It come relief, yet Minerva felt chill spreading spine veins, lungs bones.  She remembered conversations like this.  She remembered conversations like ten years ago, time blood run Britain wide rivers, wizards witches taught class slaughtered hundreds, remembered burning homes screaming children flashes green light -  "What tell Madam Bones?" whispered.  Albus stood desk paced center room, hand lightly touching devices, instrument light, instrument sound; adjusted glasses one hand, used center long silver beard robes, finally ancient wizard turned back faced them.  "I tell little I know Dark Art called horcrux, soul deprived death," said Albus Dumbledore, soft voice seemed fill whole room, "and I tell may done flesh servant."  "I tell I reconstituting Order Phoenix."  "I tell Voldemort returned."  "And Second Wizarding War begun."   Some hours later...  The antique old clock upon wall Deputy Headmistress's office golden hands, silver numerals make clock-face; ticked jerked soundlessly motions, Quieting enchantment it.  The golden hour hand approached silver numeral nine, golden minute hand same, two linked components Time nearing other, soon place never collide.  It 8:43 PM, time approached Harry's Time-Turner would open, tested one way imaginable spell could fool, unless spell could bypass laws Time itself. No body soul, knowledge substance, could stretch extra seven hours single day. She would make message spot, tell Harry take message back six hours Professor Flitwick 3PM, would ask Professor Flitwick received hour.  And Professor Flitwick would tell indeed received 3PM.  And would tell Severus Albus little faith Harry next time.  Professor McGonagall cast Patronus Charm, told shining cat, "Go Mr. Potter, tell this: Mr. Potter, please come office soon hear this, without anything else along way."   Chapter 62: The Stanford Prison Experiment, Final  Minerva gazed clock, golden hands silver numerals, jerking motion. Muggles invented that, had, wizards bothered keeping time. Bells, timed sanded hourglass, served Hogwarts classes built. It one things blood purists wished true, therefore Minerva knew it.  She received Outstanding Muggle Studies N.E.W.T., seemed mark shame, considering little knew. Her younger self realized, even then, class sham, taught pureblood, supposedly Muggleborns could appreciate wizardborns needed told, actually Board Governors approve Muggles all. But seventeen Outstanding grade main thing mattered her, saddened remember...  If Harry Potter Voldemort fight war Muggle weapons nothing left world fire!  She imagine it, reason imagine imagine Harry fighting You-Know-Who.  She encountered Dark Lord four times survived one, three times Albus shield Moody side. She remembered damaged, snakelike face, faint green scales scattered skin, glowing red eyes, voice laughed high-pitched hiss promised nothing cruelty torment: monster pure complete.  And Harry Potter easy picture mind, bright expression face young boy wavered taking ludicrous seriously taking serious ludicrously.  And think two facing wandpoint painful imagined.  They right, right set eleven-year-old boy. She knew Headmaster decided day, told make arrangements; age would raged screamed cried inconsolable weeks, and...  He ordinary first-year, Albus said. He marked Dark Lord's equal, power Dark Lord knows not.  The terrible hollow voice booming Sybill Trelawney's throat, true original prophecy, echoed mind. She feeling mean Headmaster thought did, way put difference words.  And even still seemed true, eleven-year-old within Earth entire could bear burden, boy approached office now. And said anything like 'poor Harry' face... well, like it.  So I've got find way kill immortal Dark Wizard, Harry said day first learned. I really wish told I started shopping...  She'd Head House Gryffindor long enough, she'd watched enough friends die, know people save becoming heroes.  There came knock door, Professor McGonagall said, "Enter."  When Harry entered, face cold, alert look she'd seen Mary's Place; wondered instant he'd wearing mask, self, whole day.  The young boy seated chair desk, said, "So time told what's going on?" Neutral words, sharpness gone expression.  Professor McGonagall's eyes rose surprise could stop them, said, "The Headmaster told nothing, Mr. Potter?"  The boy shook head. "Only he'd received warning I might danger, I safe now."  Minerva trouble meeting gaze. How could him, could lay upon eleven-year-old boy, war, destiny, prophecy... even trust him...  She forced look Harry directly, saw green eyes calm rested her.  "Professor McGonagall?" boy said quietly.  "Mr. Potter," said Professor McGonagall, "I'm afraid place explain, Headmaster still tell anything, may come back I go yell you."  The boy's eyes widened, something real Harry showing crack cool mask set back place.  "In case," Professor McGonagall said briskly. "I'm sorry inconvenience, Mr. Potter, I need ask use Time-Turner go back six hours three o'clock, give following message Professor Flitwick: Silver tree. Ask Professor note time gave message. Afterward Headmaster wishes meet convenience."  There pause.  Then boy said, "I suspected misusing Time-Turner, then?"  "Not me!" Professor McGonagall said hastily. "I sorry inconvenience, Mr. Potter."  There another pause, young boy shrugged. "It'll play hob sleep schedule I suppose can't helped. Please let house elves know I ask early breakfast at, say, three A.M. tomorrow morning, I'm receive it."  "Of course, Mr. Potter," said. "Thank understanding."  The boy rose chair gave formal nod, slipped door hand already going shirt Time-Turner waited; almost called Harry! known say after.  Instead waited, eyes clock.  How long need wait Harry Potter go back time?  She need wait all, actually; done it, already happened...  Minerva knew, then, delaying nervous, realization saddened her. Mischief, yes, unspeakable unthinkable mischief prudence foresight falling rock - know boy tricked Hat Sorting Gryffindor obviously belonged - nothing dark harmful, ever. Beneath mischief goodness ran deep true Weasley twins', though even Cruciatus Curse could gotten say loud.  "Expecto Patronum," said, then, "Go Professor Flitwick, bear back reply ask this: 'Did Mr. Potter give message me, message, receive it?'"   One hour earlier, used last remaining spin Time-Turner putting Cloak Invisibility, Harry tucked hourglass back shirt.  And set toward Slytherin dungeons, striding quickly invisible legs could manage, though running. Thankfully Deputy Headmistress's office already lower floor Hogwarts...  A staircases later, taken two steps three steps once, Harry stopped corridor around whose final bend lay entrance Slytherin dorms.  Harry took piece parchment (not paper) parch, took Quotes Quill (not pen) pouch, told quill, "Write letters exactly I say them: Z-P-G-B-S-Y, space, F-V-Y-I-R-E-B-A-G-U-R-G-E-R-R."  There two kinds codes cryptography, codes stopped little brother reading message codes stopped major governments reading message, first kind code, better nothing. In theory, one read anyway; even did, remember anything interesting unless cryptography first.  Harry put parchment parchment envelope, wand melted little green wax seal it.  In principle, course, Harry could've done hours earlier, somehow waiting heard message Professor McGonagall's lips seemed less like Messing With Time.  Harry put envelope inside another envelope, already contained another sheet paper instructions, five silver Sickles.  He closed envelope (which already name written outside), sealed green wax, pressed final Sickle seal.  Then Harry put envelope last envelope written large letters name "Merry Tavington".  And Harry peeked around bend scowling portrait served door Slytherin dorms waited; wish portrait recall not-seeing anyone invisible, Harry used Hover Charm float envelope scowling man, tap him.  The scowling man looked envelope, peering monocle, sighed, turned around face toward inside Slytherin dorms, called, "Message Merry Tavington!"  The envelope allowed fall floor.  A moments later portrait door opened, Merry snatched envelope floor.  She would open find Sickle envelope addressed fourth-year student named Margaret Bulstrode.  (Slytherins sort thing time, Sickle definitely constituted rush order.)  Margaret would open envelope, find five Sickles along envelope dropped unused classroom...  ...after used Time-Turner go back five hours...  ...whereupon would find another five Sickles waiting her, got quickly.  And invisible Harry Potter would waiting classroom three PM three-thirty, case someone tried obvious test.  Well, obvious Professor Quirrell, anyway.  It also obvious Professor Quirrell (a) Margaret Bulstrode Time-Turner (b) strict used it, e.g. telling younger sister really good pieces gossip "before" anyone else heard.  Some tension leaked Harry strode away portrait door, still invisible. Somehow mind still managed worry plan, even knowing already succeeded. Now remained confrontation Dumbledore, done day... he'd go Headmaster's gargoyles 9PM, since 8PM would seem suspicious. This way could claim he'd misunderstood Professor McGonagall meant "afterward"...  The obscure pain clutched Harry's heart thought Professor McGonagall.  So Harry retreated little dark side, worn calm expression kept fatigue face, kept walking.  There would come reckoning, sometimes borrow everything could today, let payments come due tomorrow.   Even Harry's dark side feeling exhaustion time spiraling staircase delivered great oaken door final gate Dumbledore's office; since Harry legally four hours past natural bedtime, safe let fatigue show, physical emotional.  The oaken door swung open -  Harry's eyes already focused direction great desk, throne behind it; took moment register throne empty, desk barren single leatherbound volume; Harry shifted gaze see wizard standing among fiddly things, mysterious unknown devices scores. Fawkes Sorting Hat occupied respective perches, bright cheerful blaze crackled nook Harry realized fireplace, two umbrellas three red slippers left feet. All things place customary appearance except old wizard himself, standing tall dressed robes formal black. It came shock eyes, robes person, Harry seen father wearing business suit.  Very ancient appearance Albus Dumbledore, sorrowful.  "Hello, Harry," said old wizard.  From within alternate self maintained like Occlumency construct, innocent-Harry absolutely idea happening inclined head coldly, said, "Headmaster. I expect heard back Deputy Headmistress McGonagall now, fine you, I would really like know going on."  "Yes," said old wizard, "it time, Harry Potter." The back straightened, slightly wizard already standing straight; somehow even small change made wizard seem foot taller, stronger younger, formidable though dangerous, potency gathered like cowl. In clear voice, then, spoke: "This day war Voldemort begun."  "What?" said outer Harry knew nothing, something watching inside thought much lot profanity attached.  "Bellatrix Black taken Azkaban, escaped prison inescapable," old wizard said. "It feat bears Voldemort's signature ever I seen it; she, faithful servant, one three requisites must obtain rise new body. After ten years enemy defeated returned, foretold."  Neither part Harry could think anything say that, least seconds old wizard continued.  "It need change little you, now," said old wizard. "I begun reconstituting Order Phoenix serve you, I alerted souls understand: Amelia Bones, Alastor Moody, Bartemius Crouch, certain others. Of prophecy - yes, prophecy - I told them, know Voldemort returned, know play vital role. They I shall fight war lesser beginnings, grow stronger, perhaps wiser, Hogwarts." The old wizard's hand came up, though beseeching. "So you, now, one change, I implore understand necessity. Do recognize book desk, Harry?"  The inner part Harry screaming banging head imaginary walls, outer Harry turned stared proved -  There rather long pause.  Then Harry said, "It copy The Lord Rings J. R. R. Tolkien."  "You recognized quote book," said Dumbledore, intent look eyes, "so I assume remember well. If I mistaken, let corrected."  Harry stared him.  "It important understand," said Dumbledore, "that book realistic depiction wizarding war. John Tolkien never fought Voldemort. Your war like books read. Real life like stories. Do understand, Harry?"  Harry, rather slowly, nodded yes; shook head no.  "In particular," said Dumbledore, "there certain foolish thing Gandalf first book. He makes many mistakes, Tolkien's wizard; one error unforgivable. That mistake this: When Gandalf first suspected, even moment, Frodo held One Ring, moved Frodo Rivendell once. He might embarrassed, old wizard, suspicions proven false. He might found awkward command Frodo, Frodo would greatly inconvenienced, needing set aside many plans pastimes. But little embarrassment, awkwardness, inconvenience, nothing compared loss whole war, nine Nazgul swoop Shire reading old scrolls Minas Tirith, take Ring once. And Frodo alone would hurt; Middle-Earth would fallen slavery. If story, Harry, would lost war. Do understand I saying?"  "Er..." said Harry, "not exactly..." There something Dumbledore like this, made hard stay properly cold; dark side trouble weird.  "Then I spell out," said old wizard. His voice stern, eyes sad. "Frodo moved Rivendell Gandalf - Frodo never left Rivendell without guard. There night terror Bree, Barrow-downs, Weathertop Frodo wounded, could lost entire war times, Gandalf's folly! Do understand I saying you, son Michael Petunia?"  And Harry knew nothing understand.  And Harry knew nothing saw smart, wise, intelligent sane, right thing do.  And Harry knew nothing said innocent Harry would said, silent watcher screamed confusion agony.  "You're saying," Harry said, voice shaking emotions inside burned outer calm, "that I'm going home parents Easter."  "You see again," old wizard said swiftly. "I beg come you, I extend every courtesy visits. But going home Easter, Harry. You going home summer. You longer taking lunches Diagon Alley, even Professor Quirrell watch you. Your blood second requisite Voldemort needs rise strong before. So never leaving bounds Hogwarts's wards without vital reason, guard strong enough fend attack long enough get safety. "  Water beginning corners Harry's eyes. "Is request?" said quavering voice. "Or order?"  "I'm sorry, Harry," old wizard said softly. "Your parents see necessity, I hope; not... I afraid recourse; law, however wrongly, recognize guardians. I sorry, Harry, I understand despise it, must done."  Harry whirled, looked door, look Dumbledore more, trust face.  This cost yourself, said Hufflepuff within mind, even imposed costs others. Will change whole view matter, way Professor Quirrell thinks will?  Automatically, mask innocent Harry said exactly would said: "Are parents danger? Do need moved here?"  "No," said old wizard's voice. "I think so. The Death Eaters learned, toward end war, attack Order's families. And Voldemort acting without former companions, still knows I make decisions now, knows I would give nothing threat family. I taught I give blackmail, try."  Harry turned back then, saw coldness old wizard's face match shift voice, Dumbledore's blue eyes grown hard steel behind glasses, match person matched formal black robes.  "Is everything, then?" said Harry's trembling voice. Later would think this, later would think cunning countermeasure, later would ask Professor Quirrell way convince Headmaster mistaken. Right now, maintaining mask taking Harry's attention.  "Voldemort used Muggle artifact escape Azkaban," old wizard said. "He watching learning you, Harry Potter. Soon man named Arthur Weasley Ministry issue edict use Muggle artifacts must cease Defense Professor's battles. In future, good idea, keep closer yourself."  It seem important comparison. Harry nodded, said again, "Is everything?"  There pause.  "Please," said old wizard whisper. "I right ask forgiveness, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, please, least say understand why." There water old wizard's eyes.  "I understand," said voice outer Harry understand, "I mean... I sort thinking anyway... wondering whether I could get parents let stay Hogwarts summer like orphans, I could read library here, interesting Hogwarts anyway..."  A choking sound came Albus Dumbledore's throat.  Harry turned toward door. It escape unscathed, escape.  He took step forward.  His hand reached door-handle.  A piercing cry split air -  As though slow motion, Harry spun, saw phoenix already launched air winging toward him.  From true Harry, one knew guilt, came flash panic, thought that, anticipated it, he'd prepared face Dumbledore he'd forgotten Fawkes -  Flap, flap, flap, three times phoenix's wings flapped like flaring dying fire, duration seemed pass slowly Fawkes soared mysterious devices toward Harry stood.  And red-golden bird hovering front gentle wing-sweeps, bobbing air like candle-flame.  "What it, Fawkes?" said false Harry puzzlement, looking phoenix eyes, would innocent. The real Harry, feeling awful sickness inside Professor McGonagall expressed trust him, thought, Did I turn evil today, Fawkes? I think I evil... Do hate now? If I've become something phoenix hates, maybe I give now, give everything confess -  Fawkes screamed, terrible cry Harry ever heard, scream set devices vibrating made sleeping figures start within portraits.  It pierced Harry's defenses like white-hot sword butter, collapsed layers like punctured balloon popping, reshuffled priorities instant remembered one important thing; tears began pouring freely Harry's eyes, cheeks, voice choked words came throat like coughing lava -  "Fawkes says," Harry's voice said, "he wants me, do, something, about, prisoners, Azkaban -"  "Fawkes, no!" said old wizard. Dumbledore strode forward, reaching phoenix pleading hand. The old wizard's voice almost desperate phoenix's scream been. "You cannot ask him, Fawkes, he's boy still!"  "You went Azkaban," Harry whispered, "you took Fawkes you, saw - saw - there, saw - WHY DIDN'T YOU DO ANYTHING? WHY DIDN'T YOU LET THEM OUT?"  When instruments stopped vibrating, Harry realized Fawkes screamed time scream, phoenix flying next Harry facing Dumbledore side, red-golden head level own.  "Can you," whispered old wizard, "can truly hear voice phoenix clearly?"  Harry sobbing almost hard speak, metal doors he'd passed, voices he'd heard, worst memories, desperate begging walked away, burst mind like fire phoenix's scream, inner bulwarks smashed. Harry know whether could truly hear voice phoenix clearly, whether would understood Fawkes without already knowing. All Harry knew plausible excuse say things Professor Quirrell told must never raise conversation day forth; innocent Harry would said, would done, heard clearly. "They're hurting - help -"  "I can't!" cried Albus Dumbledore. "Harry, Fawkes, I can't, there's nothing I do!"  Another piercing scream.  "WHY NOT? JUST GO IN AND TAKE THEM OUT!"  The old wizard wrenched gaze phoenix, eyes meeting Harry's instead. "Harry, tell Fawkes me! Tell simple! Phoenixes mere animals animals, Harry, can't understand -"  "I understand either," Harry said, voice trembling. "I understand feeding people Dementors! Azkaban prison, torture chamber torturing people DEATH!"  "Percival," said old wizard hoarsely, "Percival Dumbledore, father, Harry, father died Azkaban! I know, I know horror! But would me? To break Azkaban force? Would declare open rebellion Ministry?"  CAW!  There pause, Harry's trembling voice said, "Fawkes know anything governments, wants - take prisoners - cells - he'll help fight, anyone stands way - - I, Headmaster! I'll go destroy Dementor comes near! We'll worry political fallout afterward, I bet I together could get away -"  "Harry," whispered old wizard, "phoenixes understand winning battle lose war." Tears streaming old wizard's cheeks, dripping silver beard. "The battle know. They good, wise. That choose wizards masters."  "Can bring Dementors I get them?" Harry's voice begging, now. "Bring groups fifteen - I think I could destroy many time without hurting -"  The old wizard shook head. "It hard enough pass loss one - might give one more, never two - considered national possessions, Harry, weapons case war -"  Fury blazed Harry then, blazed like fire, might come phoenix rested shoulder, might come dark side, two angers mixed within him, cold hot, strange voice said throat, "Tell something. What government do, voters democracy, people country do, I ought decide I'm side more?"  The old wizard's eyes widened stared boy phoenix upon shoulder. "Harry... words, Defense Professor's -"  "Because point, there? And Azkaban, it, then?"  "Harry, listen, please, hear me! Wizards could live together declared rebellion whole, every time differed! Always something -"  "Azkaban something! It's evil!"  "Yes, even evil! Even evils, Harry, wizards perfectly good! And yet better live peace, chaos; I break Azkaban force would beginning chaos, see it?" The old wizard's voice pleading. "And possible oppose fellows openly secret, without hating them, without declaring evil enemy! I think people country deserve you, Harry! And even - children, students Hogwarts, many good people mixed bad?"  Harry looked shoulder Fawkes perched, saw phoenix's eyes gazing back him, glow yet blazed, red flames sea golden fire.  What think, Fawkes?  "Caw?" said phoenix.  Fawkes understand conversation.  The young boy looked old wizard, said thick voice, "Or maybe phoenixes wiser us, smarter us, maybe follow us around hoping someday we'll listen them, someday we'll get it, someday we'll take, prisoners, out, cells -"  Harry spun pulled open oaken door stepped onto staircase slammed door behind him.  The stairwell began rotating, Harry began descending, put face hands, began weep.  It halfway bottom noticed difference, noticed warmth still spreading him, realized -  "Fawkes?" Harry whispered.  - phoenix still shoulder, perched seen times upon Dumbledore's.  Harry looked eyes, red flames golden fire.  "You're phoenix now... you?"  Caw!  "Oh," Harry said, voice trembling little, "I'm glad hear that, Fawkes, I think - Headmaster - I think deserves -"  Harry stopped, took breath.  "I think deserves that, Fawkes, trying right thing..."  Caw!  "But angry trying make point. I understand."  The phoenix nestled head Harry's shoulder, stone gargoyle walked smoothly aside let Harry pass back corridors Hogwarts.   Chapter 63: TSPE, Aftermaths  Aftermath, Hermione Granger:  She starting close books put away homework preparation sleep, Padma Mandy stacking books across table her, Harry Potter walked Ravenclaw common room; realized, seen since breakfast.  That realization rapidly stomped-on much startling one.  There golden-red winged creature Harry's shoulder, bright bird fire.  And Harry looked sad worn really tired like phoenix thing keeping feet, still warmth him, crossed eyes might thought looking Headmaster somehow, impression went Hermione's mind even though make sense.  Harry Potter trudged across Ravenclaw common room, past sofas full staring girls, past cardgame-circles staring boys, heading her.  In theory talking Harry Potter yet, week tomorrow, whatever going clearly whole lot important -  "Fawkes," Harry said, opening mouth, "that girl Hermione Granger, talking right I'm idiot, want good person's shoulder better me."  So much exhaustion hurt Harry Potter's voice -  But could figure it, phoenix glided Harry's shoulder like fire creeping matchstick fast-forward, flashing toward her; phoenix flying front staring eyes light flame.  "Caw?" asked phoenix.  Hermione stared it, feeling like facing question test she'd forgotten study for, one important question she'd gone whole life without studying it, find anything say.  "I'm -" said. "I'm twelve, I done anything yet -"  The phoenix glided gently around, rotating around one wingtip like light air was, soared back Harry Potter's shoulder, settled quite firmly.  "You silly boy," said Padma across her, looking like deciding whether laugh grimace, "phoenixes smart girls homework, they're idiots charge straight five older Slytherin bullies. There's reason Gryffindor colors red gold, know."  There lot friendly laughter Ravenclaw common room.  Hermione one laughing ones.  Neither Harry.  Harry put hand face. "Tell Hermione I'm sorry," said Padma, voice almost fallen whisper. "Tell I forgot phoenixes animals, understand time planning, understand people going good things later - I'm sure understand really notion something person is, see people do. Fawkes know twelve means. Tell Hermione I'm sorry - I - goes wrong, it?"  Harry turned go, phoenix still shoulder, began slowly trudging toward staircase led dorm.  And Hermione leave that, leave that. She know competition Harry something else. She leave phoenix turning away her.  She -  Her mind keyed frantic question entirety excellent memory, found one thing -  "I going run front Dementor try save Harry!" shouted little desperately red-golden bird. "I mean, I actually start running everything! That stupid courageous, right?"  With warbling cry phoenix launched Harry's shoulder again, back toward like spreading blaze, circled three times like center inferno, moment wing brushed cheek, phoenix soared back Harry.  There hush Ravenclaw common room.  "Told so," Harry said aloud, started climbing stairs bedroom; seemed climb quickly, like light feet reason, moment Fawkes gone.  Hermione held trembling hand cheek Fawkes brushed wing, spot warmth lingering like one small patch skin gently set fire.  She'd answered question phoenix, supposed, felt like she'd barely squeaked test, like she'd gotten 62 could've gotten 104 she'd tried harder.  If she'd tried all.  She really trying, thought it.  Just homework -  Who saved?   Aftermath, Fawkes:  Nightmares, boy expected, screams begging howling hurricanes emptiness, discharge horrors laid memory, fashion, perhaps, becoming part past.  And boy knew nightmares would come.  The next night, would come.  The boy dreamed, dreams world fire, Hogwarts fire, home fire, streets Oxford fire, ablaze golden flames shone consume, people walking blazing streets shining white light brighter fire, like flames themselves, stars.  The first-year boys came bed, saw themselves, wonder whose rumor already heard, bed Harry Potter lay silent motionless, gentle smile face, perched pillow red-golden bird watched him, bright wings swept like blanket pulled head.  The reckoning put one night.   Aftermath, Draco Malfoy:  Draco straightened robes, making sure green trim straight. He waved wand head said Charm Father taught children still playing mud, Charm ensured single speck lint dust would dirty wizard's robes.  Draco picked mysterious envelope Father owled him, tucked robes. He already used Incendio Everto mysterious note.  And headed breakfast, seat exactly tick clock food appeared, could manage it, would seem like others waiting appearance eat. Because scion Malfoy first everything, including breakfast, why.  Vincent Gregory waiting outside door private room, even - though not, course, dressed quite sharply.  The Slytherin common room deserted, anyone got early heading straight breakfast anyway.  The dungeon halls silent footsteps, empty echoing.  The Great Hall hubbub alarm despite relative arrivals, younger children crying, students running back forth tables standing knots shouting other, red-robed prefect standing front two green-trimmed students yelling Snape striding toward mess -  The noise dimmed little people caught sight Draco, faces turned stare him, fell quiet.  The food appeared tables. No one looked it.  And Snape spun heel, abandoning target, headed straight toward Draco.  A knot fear clutched Draco's heart, something happened Father - no, surely Father would told - whatever happening, Father told -  There bags fatigue beneath Snape's eyes, Draco saw Head House came close, Potions Master never sharp dresser (that understatement) robes even dirtier disarrayed morning, spotted extra grease.  "You heard?" hissed Head House came close. "For pity's sake, Malfoy, newspaper delivered?"  "What it, Profe-"  "Bellatrix Black taken Azkaban!"  "What?" said Draco shock, Gregory behind said something really Vincent gasped.  Snape gazing narrowed eyes, nodded abruptly. "Lucius told nothing, then. I see." Snape gave snort, turned away -  "Professor!" said Draco. The implications starting dawn him, mind spinning frantically. "Professor, I - Father instruct -"  "Then I suggest," Snape said sneeringly, strode away, "that tell that, Malfoy, father intended!"  Draco glanced back Vincent Gregory, though know bothering, course looked even confused did.  And Draco walked forward Slytherin table, sat far end, still empty sitters.  Draco put sausage omelet plate, began eating automatic motions.  Bellatrix Black taken Azkaban.  Bellatrix Black taken Azkaban...?  Draco know make that, totally unexpected Sun going - well, Sun would expectedly go six billion years unexpected Sun going tomorrow. Father done it, Dumbledore done it, one able - mean - use would Bellatrix anyone ten years Azkaban - even got strong again, use powerful sorceress completely evil insane fanatically devoted Dark Lord around anymore?  "Hey," said Vincent sitting next Draco, "I understand, boss, why'd that?"  "We it, dolt!" snapped Draco. "Oh, Merlin's sake, even think - father ever tell stories Bellatrix Black? She tortured Father once, tortured father, tortured everyone, Dark Lord told Crucio it! She crazy things inspire fear obedience populace, crazy things crazy! She's bitch is!"  "Oh, really?" said incensed voice behind Draco.  Draco look up. Gregory Vincent would watching back.  "I would've thought happy -"  "- hear Death Eater freed, Malfoy!"  Amycus Carrow always one problem people; Father told Draco make sure never alone room Amycus...  Draco turned around gave Flora Hestia Carrow Number Three Sneer, one said Noble Most Ancient House yes, mattered. Draco said general direction, certainly deigning address particular, "There's Death Eaters there's Death Eaters," turned back food.  There two furious huffs unison, two pairs shoes stormed toward end Slytherin table.  It minutes later Millicent Bulstrode ran them, visibly breath, said, "Mr. Malfoy, hear?"  "About Bellatrix Black?" said Draco. "Yeah -"  "No, Potter!"  "What?"  "Potter going around phoenix shoulder last night, looking like he'd dragged ten leagues mud, say phoenix took Azkaban try stop Bellatrix fought duel blew half fortress!"  "What?" said Draco. "Oh, way -"  Draco stopped.  He'd said number times Harry Potter started notice trend.  Millicent ran tell someone else.  "You really think -" said Gregory.  "I honestly know anymore," said Draco.  A minutes later, Theodore Nott sat across William Rosier gone sit Carrow twins, Vincent nudged said, "There."  Harry Potter entered Great Hall.  Draco watched closely.  There alarm Harry's face saw, surprise shock, looked...  It distant, self-absorbed look Harry wore trying figure answer question Draco understand yet.  Draco hastily shoved bench Slytherin table, saying "Stay behind," walked decorous speed toward Harry.  Harry seemed notice approach boy turning toward Ravenclaw table, Draco -  - gave Harry one quick look -  - walked right past him, straight Great Hall.  It minute later Harry peered around corner small stony nook Draco waited, might fool everyone would create plausible deniability.  "Quietus," said Harry. "Draco, -"  Draco took envelope robes. "I message Father."  "Huh?" said Harry, took envelope Draco, tore open rather un-neat manner, drew forth sheet parchment unfolded -  Harry gave sharp intake breath.  Then Harry looked Draco.  Then Harry looked back parchment.  There pause.  Harry said, "Did Lucius tell report reaction this?"  Draco paused moment, weighing, opened mouth -  "I see did," said Harry, Draco cursed himself, known better, hard decide. "What going tell him?"  "That surprised," said Draco.  "Surprised," Harry said flatly. "Yeah. Good. Tell that."  "What it?" said Draco. And then, saw Harry looking conflicted, "If dealing Father behind back -"  And Harry, without word, gave Draco paper.  It said:  I know you.  "WHAT THE -"  "I going ask that," said Harry. "Have got idea what's Dad?"  Draco stared Harry.  Then Draco said, "Did it?"  "What?" said Harry. "What possible reason would I - would I -"  "Did it, Harry?"  "No!" Harry said. "Of course not!"  Draco listened carefully, detected hesitation tremor.  So Draco nodded, said, "I've got idea Father's thinking can't, I mean can't possibly good. And, um... people also saying..."  "What," said Harry warily, "are saying, Draco?"  "Did phoenix really take Azkaban try stop Bellatrix Black escaping -"   Aftermath: Neville Longbottom  Harry sat Ravenclaw table first time, hoping grab quick bite food. He knew needed go think things, tiny remaining bit phoenix's peace (even encounter Draco) still wanted cling to, beautiful dream remembered nothing beauty; part feeling peaceful waiting anvils finish dropping him, went think while, could batch-process disasters once.  Harry's hand grasped fork, lifted bite mashed potatoes toward mouth -  And shriek.  Every someone would shout heard news, Harry's ears recognized one -  Harry bench instant, heading toward Hufflepuff table, horrible sick feeling dawning pit stomach. It one things considered he'd decided commit crime, Professor Quirrell planned one know; now, afterward, Harry - thought -  This, Hufflepuff said bitter intensity, also fault.  But time Harry got there, Neville sitting eating fried sausage patties Snippyfig Sauce.  The Hufflepuff boy's hands trembling, cut food, ate it, without dropping it.  "Hello, General," Neville said, voice wavering slightly. "Did fight duel Bellatrix Black last night?"  "No," Harry said. His voice also wavery, reason.  "Didn't think so," said Neville. There scraping sound knife cut sausage again. "I'm going hunt kill her, I count help?"  There startled gasps mass Hufflepuffs gathered around Neville.  "If comes you," Harry said hoarsely, terrible mistake, lie, "I'll defend even life," let get hurt I did, matter what, "but I help go her, Neville, friends help friends commit suicide."  Neville's fork paused way mouth.  Then Neville put bite food mouth, chewed again.  And Neville swallowed it.  And Neville said, "I mean right now, I mean I graduate Hogwarts."  "Neville," Harry said, keeping voice careful control, "I think, even graduate, might still plainstupid idea. There's got much experienced Aurors tracking -" oh, wait, that's good -  "Listen him!" said Ernie Macmillan, older-looking Hufflepuff girl standing close Neville said, "Nevvy, please, think it, he's right!"  Neville stood up.  Neville said, "Please follow me."  Neville walked away them; Harry Ernie reaching involuntarily toward him, Hufflepuffs well.  And Neville sat Gryffindor table, distantly (though strain hear) heard Neville say, "I'm going hunt kill I graduate, anyone want help?" least five voices said "Yes" Ron Weasley said loudly, "Get line, lot, I got owl Mum morning, says tell everyone called dibs" someone said "Molly Weasley Bellatrix Black? Who even think kidding -" Ron reached plate hefted muffin -  Someone tapped Harry shoulder, turned around saw unfamiliar green-trimmed older girl, handed parchment envelope quickly strode away.  Harry stared envelope moment, started walking toward nearest wall. That private, private enough, Harry want give impression much hide.  That Slytherin System delivery, used wanted communicate someone without anyone else knowing two talked. The sender gave envelope someone reputation reliable messenger, along ten Knuts; first person would take five Knuts pass envelope another messenger along five Knuts, second messenger would open envelope find another envelope name written deliver envelope person. That way neither two people passing message knew sender recipient, one else knew two parties contact...  When Harry reached wall, put envelope inside robes, opened beneath folds cloth, carefully snuck peek parchment drew forth.  It said,  Classroom left Transfiguration, 8 morning.  - LL.  Harry stared it, trying remember knew anyone initials LL.  His mind searched...  Searched...  Retrieved -  "The Quibbler girl?" Harry whispered incredulously, shut mouth. She ten years old, Hogwarts all!   Aftermath: Lesath Lestrange.  Harry standing unused classroom next Transfiguration 8AM, waiting, he'd least managed get food facing next disaster, Luna Lovegood...  The door classroom opened, Harry saw, gave really hard mental kick.  One thing thought of, one thing really have.  The older boy's green-trimmed formal robes askew, red spots looking much like small dots fresh blood, one corner mouth look place cut healed, Episkey minor medical Charm quite erase damage.  Lesath Lestrange's face streaked tears, fresh tears half-dried tears, water eyes, promise still way. "Quietus," said older boy, "Homenum Revelio" things, Harry thought frantically without much luck.  And Lesath lowered wand sheathed robes, slowly time, formally, older boy dropped knees dusty classroom floor.  Bowed head way down, forehead also touched dust, Harry would spoken voiceless.  Lesath Lestrange said, breaking voice, "My life yours, Lord, death well."  "I," Harry said, huge lump throat trouble speaking, "I -" anything it, saying, saying right now, innocent Harry would trouble speaking -  "Thank you," whispered Lesath, "thank you, Lord, oh, thank you," sound choked-off sob came kneeling boy, Harry could see hair back head, nothing face. "I'm fool, Lord, ungrateful bastard, unworthy serve you, I cannot abase enough, I - I shouted helped me, I thought refusing me, I even realize morning I'd fool ask front Longbottom -"  "I anything it," Harry said.  (It still hard tell outright lie like that.)  Slowly Lesath raised head floor, looked Harry.  "I understand, Lord," said older boy, voice wavering little, "you trust cunning, indeed I shown fool... I wanted say you, I ungrateful, I know must hard enough save one person, they're alerted now, can't - get Father - I ungrateful, I never ungrateful again. If ever use unworthy servant, call wherever I am, I answer, Lord -"  "I involved way."  (But got easier time.)  Lesath gazed Harry, said uncertainly, "Am I dismissed presence, Lord...?"  "I Lord."  Lesath said, "Yes, Lord, I understand," pushed back floor, stood straight bowed deeply, backed away Harry turned open classroom door.  As Lesath's hand touched doorknob, paused.  Harry see Lesath's face, older boy's voice said, "Did send someone would take care her? Did ask all?"  And Harry said, voice perfectly level, "Please stop that. I involved way."  "Yes, Lord, I'm sorry, Lord," said Lesath's voice; Slytherin boy opened door went shut door behind him. His feet sped ran away, fast enough Harry hear start sobbing.  Would I cry? wondered Harry. If I knew nothing, I innocent, would I cry right now?  Harry know, kept looking door.  And unbelievably tactless part thought, Yay, completed quest got minion -  Shut up. If ever want vote anything ever again... shut up.   Aftermath, Amelia Bones:  "Then life danger, I take it," said Amelia.  The healer, stern-eyed old man wore robes white (he Muggleborn honoring strange tradition Muggles, Amelia never asked, although privately thought made look much like ghost), shook head said, "Definitely not."  Amelia looked human form resting unconscious healer's bed, burned blasted flesh, thin sheet covered modesty's sake peeled back command.  He might make full recovery.  He might not.  The healer said early say.  Then Amelia looked witch room, detective.  "And say," Amelia said, "that burning matter Transfigured water, presumably form ice."  The detective nodded head, said, sounding puzzled, "It could much worse, -"  "How nice them," spat, pressed weary hand forehead. No... no, intended kindness. By final stage escape would point trying fool anyone. Whoever done this, then, trying mitigate damage - they'd thinking terms Aurors breathing smoke, anyone attacked fire. If still control, doubt, would steered rocker mercifully.  But Bellatrix Black ridden rocker Azkaban alone, watching Aurors agreed that, they'd Anti-Disillusionment Charms active one woman rocker, though rocker sported two sets stirrups.  Some good innocent person, capable casting Patronus Charm, tricked rescuing Bellatrix Black.  Some innocent fought Bahry One-Hand, carefully subduing experienced Auror without significantly injuring him.  Some innocent Transfigured fuel Muggle artifact two ride Azkaban, making frozen water benefit Aurors.  And usefulness Bellatrix Black ended.  You would expected anyone capable subduing Bahry One-Hand foreseen part. But expected anyone could cast Patronus Charm try rescuing Bellatrix Black first place.  Amelia passed hand eyes, closing moment silent mourning. I wonder was, You-Know-Who manipulated them... story could possibly told...  She even realize moment later thought meant starting believe. Perhaps because, matter difficult believe Dumbledore, becoming difficult recognize hand cold, dark intelligence.   Aftermath, Albus Dumbledore:  It might fifty-seven seconds breakfast ended might needed four twists Time-Turner, end, Albus Dumbledore make it.  "Headmaster?" squeaked polite voice Professor Filius Flitwick, old wizard passed way seat. "Mr. Potter left message you."  The old wizard stopped. He looked inquiringly Charms Professor.  "Mr. Potter said woke up, realized unfair things said Fawkes screamed. Mr. Potter said saying anything anything else, apologizing one part."  The old wizard kept looking Charms Professor, still speak.  "Headmaster?" squeaked Filius.  "Tell I said thank you," said Albus Dumbledore, "but wiser listen phoenixes wise old wizards," sat place three seconds food vanished.   Aftermath, Professor Quirrell:  "No," Madam Pomfrey snapped child, "you may see him! You may pester him! You may ask one little question! He rest bed nothing least three days!"   Aftermath, Minerva McGonagall:  She heading toward infirmary, Harry Potter leaving it, passed other.  The look gave angry.  It sad.  It say much all.  It like... like looking long enough make clear deliberately avoiding looking her.  And looked away could figure look give return; though wanted spare that, well.  He say anything walked past her.  Neither she.  What could possibly say?   Aftermath, Fred George Weasley:  They actually yelped loud, turned corner saw Dumbledore.  It Headmaster popped nowhere staring stern expression. Dumbledore always that.  But wizard dressed formal black robes looking ancient powerful giving two SHARP LOOK.  "Fred George Weasley!" spake Dumbledore Voice Power.  "Yes, Headmaster!" said, snapping upright giving crisp military salute they'd seen old pictures.  "Hear well! You friends Harry Potter, so?"  "Yes, Headmaster!"  "Harry Potter danger. He must go beyond wards Hogwarts. Listen me, sons Weasley, I beg listen: know I Gryffindor yourselves, I know higher rules rules. But this, Fred George, one thing terrible importance, must exception time, small great! If help Harry leave Hogwarts may die! Does send mission, may go, ask bring items, may help, asks smuggle person Hogwarts, must refuse! Do understand?"  "Yes, Headmaster!" They said without even thinking, really, exchanged uncertain looks -  The bright blue eyes Headmaster intent upon them. "No. Not without thinking. If Harry asks bring out, must refuse, asks tell way, must refuse. I ask report me, I know would never do. But beg behalf go me, importance, I guard walks. Fred, George, I sorry strain friendship so, life."  The two looked long while, communicating, thinking things time.  They looked back Dumbledore.  They said, chill running spoke name, "Bellatrix Black."  "You may safely assume," said Headmaster, "that least bad."  "Okay -"  "- got it."   Aftermath, Alastor Moody Severus Snape:  When Alastor Moody lost eye, commandeered services erudite Ravenclaw, Samuel H. Lyall, Moody mistrusted slightly less average Moody refrained reporting unregistered werewolf; paid Lyall compile list every known magical eye, every known hint location.  When Moody gotten list back, bothered reading it; top list Eye Vance, dating back era Hogwarts, currently possession powerful Dark Wizard ruling tiny forgotten hellhole Britain anywhere else he'd worry silly rules.  That Alastor Moody lost left foot acquired Eye Vance, oppressed souls Urulat liberated period around two weeks another Dark Wizard moved power vacuum.  He'd considered going Left Foot Vance next, decided realized would expecting.  Now Mad-Eye Moody turning slowly, always turning, surveying graveyard Little Hangleton. It lot gloomier, place, broad daylight seemed like nothing grassy place marked ordinary tombstones, demarcated chained twists fragile, easily climbable metal Muggles used instead wards. (Moody could comprehend Muggles thinking score, pretending wards, what, decided ask whether Muggle criminals respected pretense.)  Moody actually need turn survey graveyard.  The Eye Vance saw full globe world every direction around him, matter pointing.  But particular reason let former Death Eater like Severus Snape know that.  Sometimes people called Moody 'paranoid'.  Moody always told survive hundred years hunting Dark Wizards get back that.  Mad-Eye Moody worked long taken him, retrospect, achieve considered decent level caution - weighed much experience taken get good instead lucky - begun suspect people died got there. Moody expressed thought Lyall, done ciphering figuring, told typical Dark Wizard hunter would die, average, eight half times along way becoming 'paranoid'. This explained great deal, assuming Lyall lying.  Yesterday, Albus Dumbledore told Mad-Eye Moody Dark Lord used unspeakable dark arts survive death body, awake abroad, seeking regain power begin Wizarding War anew.  Someone else might reacted incredulity.  "I can't believe lot never told resurrection thing," Mad-Eye Moody said considerable acerbity. "D'you realize long it'll take grave every ancestor every Dark Wizard I've ever killed could've smart enough make horcrux? You're one, you?"  "I redose one every year," Severus Snape said calmly, uncapping third flask man claimed would seventeen bottles, beginning wave wand it. "The ancestral graves we've able locate poisoned long-lasting substances, since us less free time yourself."  Moody watched fluid spiraling vial vanishing, appear within bones marrow been. "But think worth effort trap, instead Vanishing bones."  "He avenues life, perceive one blocked," Snape said dryly, uncapping fourth bottle. "And ask, must original grave, place first burial, bone removed ritual before. Thus cannot retrieved earlier; also point substituting skeleton weaker ancestor. He would notice lost potency."  "Who else knows trap?" Moody demanded.  "You. Me. The Headmaster. No one else."  Moody snorted. "Pfah. Did Albus tell Amelia, Bartemius, McGonagall woman resurrection ritual?"  "Yes -"  "If Voldie finds Albus knows resurrection ritual Albus told them, Voldie'll figure Albus told me, Voldie knows I'd think this." Moody shook head disgust. "What're ways Voldie could come back life?"  Snape's hand paused fifth bottle (it Disillusioned, course, whole operation Disillusioned, meant less nothing Moody, marked Eye's sight trying-to-hide), former Death Eater said, "You need know."  "You're learning, son," said Moody mild approval. "What's bottles?"  Snape opened fifth bottle, gestured wand begin substance flowing toward grave, said, "This one? A Muggle narcotic called LSD. A conversation yesterday put mind Muggle things, LSD seemed interesting option, I hurried obtain some. If incorporated resurrection potion, I suspect effects permanent."  "What do?" said Moody.  "It said effects impossible describe anyone used it," drawled Snape, "and I used it."  Moody nodded approval Snape opened sixth flask. "What one?"  "Love potion."  "Love potion?" said Moody.  "Not standard sort. It meant trigger two-way bond unbearably sweet Veela woman named Verdandi Headmaster hopes might able redeem even him, truly loved other."  "Gah!" said Moody. "That bloody sentimental fool -"  "Agreed," Severus Snape said calmly, attention focused work.  "Tell least got Malaclaw venom there."  "Second flask."  "Iocane powder."  "Either fourteenth fifteenth bottle."  "Bahl's Stupefaction," Moody said, naming extremely addictive narcotic interesting side effects people Slytherin tendencies; Moody seen addicted Dark Wizard go ridiculous lengths get victim lay hands certain exact portkey, instead someone toss target trapped Knut next visit town; going work, addict gone effort lay second Portus, portkey, had, second touch, transported victim back safety. To day, even taking drug account, Moody could imagine could possibly going man's mind time cast second Portus.  "Tenth vial," said Snape.  "Basilisk venom," offered Moody.  "What?" spat Snape. "Snake venom positive component resurrection potion! Not mention would dissolve bone substances! And would even get -"  "Calm down, son, I checking see could trusted."  Mad-Eye Moody continued (secretly unnecessary) slow turning, surveying graveyard, Potions Master continued pouring.  "Hold on," Moody said suddenly. "How know really -"  "Because says 'Tom Riddle' easily moved headstone," Snape said dryly. "And I ten Sickles Headmaster, bet would think fifth bottle. So much constant vigilance."  There pause.  "How long take Albus reali-"  "Three years learned ritual," said Snape, tone quite like usual sardonic drawl. "In retrospect, consulted earlier."  Snape uncapped ninth bottle.  "We poisoned graves well, long-lasting substances," remarked former Death Eater. "It possible correct graveyard. He may planned far ahead back slaughtering family, cannot move grave -"  "The true location look like graveyard more," Moody said flatly. "He moved graves Memory-Charmed Muggles. Not even Bellatrix Black would told anything ritual started. No one knows true location except him."  They continued futile work.   Aftermath, Blaise Zabini:  The Slytherin common room could accurately precisely described remilitarized zone; moment stepped portrait hole would see left half room Definitely Not Talking right half vice versa. It clear, need explained anyone, option taking sides.  At table exact middle room, Blaise Zabini sat himself, smirking homework. He reputation now, meant keep it.   Aftermath, Daphne Greengrass Tracey Davis:  "You anything interesting today?" said Tracey.  "Nope," said Daphne.   Aftermath, Harry Potter:  If went high enough Hogwarts, see many people around, corridors windows staircases occasional portrait, interesting sight, bronze statue furry creature like small child, holding peculiar flat spear...  If went high enough Hogwarts, see many people around, suited Harry.  There much worse places trapped, Harry supposed. In fact probably think anywhere better trapped ancient castle fractal ever-changing structure meant ever run places explore, full interesting people interesting books incredibly important knowledge unknown Muggle science.  If Harry told leave, probably would've jumped chance spend time Hogwarts, would've plotted connived get it. Hogwarts literally optimal, realms possibility maybe, certainly real planet Earth, Maximum Fun Location.  How could castle grounds seem much smaller, much confining, could rest world become much interesting important, instant Harry told allowed leave? He'd spent months felt claustrophobic then.  You know research this, observed part himself, standard scarcity effects, like time soon county outlawed phosphate detergents, people who'd never cared drove next county order buy huge loads phosphate detergent, surveys showed rated phosphate detergents gentler effective even easier-pouring... give two-year-olds choice toy open one protected barrier go around, they'll ignore toy open go one behind barrier... salespeople know sell things telling customer might available... Cialdini's book Influence, everything feeling right now, grass always greener side that's allowed.  If Harry told leave, probably would've jumped chance stay Hogwarts summer...  ...but rest life.  That sort problem, really.  Who knew whether still Dark Lord Voldemort defeat?  Who knew whether He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named still existed outside imagination possibly-not-just-pretending-to-be-crazy old wizard?  Lord Voldemort's body found burned crisp, really things souls. How could Lord Voldemort still alive? How Dumbledore know alive?  And Dark Lord, Harry defeat him, would trapped Hogwarts forever.  ...maybe would legally allowed escape graduated seventh year, six years four months three weeks now. It long lengths time went, seemed like long enough protons decay.  Only that.  It Harry's freedom stake.  The Headmaster Hogwarts, Chief Warlock Wizengamot, Supreme Mugwump International Confederation Wizards, quietly sounding alarm.  A false alarm.  A false alarm Harry triggered.  You know, said part refined skills, sort ponder, once, every different profession different way excellent, excellent teacher like excellent plumber; common certain methods stupid; one important techniques face little mistakes turn BIG mistakes?  ...although already seemed qualify BIG mistake, actually...  The point being, said inner monitor, getting worse literally minute. The way spies turn people is, get commit little sin, use little sin blackmail bigger sin, use THAT sin make even bigger things blackmailer owns soul.  Didn't think person blackmailed, could foresee whole path, would decide take punch first step, take hit exposing first sin? Didn't decide would that, anyone ever tried blackmail something major order conceal something little? Do see similarity here, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres?  Only little, already little, would lot powerful people extremely angry Harry, false alarm freeing Bellatrix Azkaban, Dark Lord exist come later, war might already lost -  You think they'll impressed honesty rationality foresight stopping snowballs even further?  Harry not, fact, think this; moment's reflection, whichever part talking to, agree absurdly optimistic.  His wandering feet took near open window, Harry went over, leaned arms ledge, stared grounds Hogwarts high above.  Brown barren trees, yellow dead grass, ice-colored ice frozen creeks frozen streams... whichever school official dubbed 'The Forbidden Forest' really understood marketing, name made want go even more. The sun sinking sky, Harry thinking hours now, thinking mostly thoughts over, key differences time, like thoughts going circles, climbing spiral, descending it.  He still believe he'd gone entire thing Azkaban - he'd switched Patronus took life, he'd stunned Auror, he'd figured hide Bella Dementors, he'd faced twelve Dementors scared away, he'd invented rocket-assisted broomstick, ridden - he'd gone entire thing without ever rallying thinking, I this... because... I promised Hermione I'd come back lunch! It felt like irrevocably missed opportunity; like, done wrong time, would never able get right matter sort challenge faced next time, promise made. Because would awkwardly deliberately make missed first time around, instead making heroic declarations could've made he'd remembered promise Hermione. Like one wrong turn irrevocable, got one chance, right first try...  He remembered promise Hermione going Azkaban.  Why decided that, again?  My working hypothesis stupid, said Hufflepuff.  That useful fault analysis, thought Harry.  If want little detail, said Hufflepuff, Defense Professor Hogwarts like 'Let's get Bellatrix Black Azkaban!' like 'Okay!'  Hold on, THAT'S fair -  Hey, said Hufflepuff, notice how, way here, individual trees sort blur together, actually see shape forest?  Why done it...?  Not cost-benefit calculation, sure. He'd embarrassed pull sheet paper start calculating expected utilities, he'd worried Professor Quirrell would stop respecting said even hesitated much help maiden distress.  He'd thought, somewhere deep inside him, mysterious teacher offered first mission, first chance, call adventure, said no, mysterious teacher walked away disgust, never got another chance hero...  ...yeah, it. In retrospect, it. He'd gone started thinking life plot plot twist, opposed to, oh, say, proposal break Bellatrix Black Azkaban. That true original reason decision split second made, brain perceptually recognizing narrative said 'no' dissonant. And thought it, rational way make decisions. Professor Quirrell's ulterior motive obtain last remains Slytherin's lost lore, Bellatrix died irrevocably forgotten, seemed impressively sane comparison; benefit commensurate appeared time small risk.  It seem fair, seem fair, happened lost grip rationality tiny fraction second, tiny fraction second required brain decide comfortable 'yes' arguments 'no' arguments discussion followed.  From high above, far enough individual trees blurred together, Harry stared forest.  Harry want confess ruin reputation forever get everyone angry maybe end killed Dark Lord later. He'd rather trapped Hogwarts six years face that. That felt. And fact helpful, relief, able cling single decisive factor, Harry confessed, Professor Quirrell would go Azkaban die there.  (A catch, break, stutter Harry's breathing.)  If phrased way... why, could even pretend hero, instead coward.  Harry lifted eyes Forbidden Forest, looked clear blue forbidden sky.  Stared glass panes big bright burning thing, fluffy things, mysterious endless blue embedded, strange new unknown place.  It... actually help, helped quite lot, think troubles nothing compared Azkaban. That people world really trouble Harry Potter one them.  What going Azkaban?  What going magical Britain?  ...which side on, now?  In bright light day, everything Albus Dumbledore said certainly sounded lot wiser Professor Quirrell. Better brighter, moral, convenient, nice true. And thing remember Dumbledore believed things sounded nice, Professor Quirrell one sane.  (Again catch breathing, happened time thought Professor Quirrell.)  But something sounded nice, make wrong, either.  And Defense Professor flaw sanity, outlook life negative.  Really? inquired part Harry read eighteen million experimental results people optimistic overconfident. Professor Quirrell pessimistic? So pessimistic expectations routinely undershoot reality? Stuff put museum, he's unique. Which one two planned perfect crime, put error margin fallbacks ended saving butt, case perfect crime went wrong? Hint hint, name Harry Potter.  But "pessimistic" correct word describe Professor Quirrell's problem - problem truly was, superior wisdom experience. But Harry looked like Professor Quirrell constantly interpreting everything worst possible light. If handed Professor Quirrell glass 90% full, he'd tell 10% empty part proved one really cared water.  That good analogy, Harry thought it. Not magical Britain like Azkaban, glass well half full...  Harry stared bright blue sky.  ...although, following analogy, Azkaban existed, maybe prove 90% good part reasons, people trying make show kindness Professor Quirrell put it. For truly kind would made Azkaban, would storm fortress tear down... they?  Harry stared bright blue sky. If wanted rationalist read awful lot papers flaws human nature, flaws innocent logical failures, looked lot darker.  Harry stared bright blue sky, thought Milgram experiment.  Stanley Milgram done investigate causes World War II, try understand citizens Germany obeyed Hitler.  So designed experiment investigate obedience, see Germans were, reason, liable obey harmful orders authority figures.  First he'd run pilot version experiment American subjects, control.  And afterward bothered trying Germany.  Experimental apparatus: A series 30 switches set horizontal line, labels starting '15 volts' going '450 volts', labels group four switches. The first group four labeled 'Slight Shock', sixth group labeled 'Extreme Intensity Shock', seventh group labeled 'Danger: Severe Shock', two last switches left labeled 'XXX'.  And actor, confederate experimenter, appeared true subjects someone like them: someone answered ad participants experiment learning, lost (rigged) lottery strapped chair, along electrodes. The true experimental subjects given slight shock electrodes, could see worked.  The true subject told experiment effects punishment learning memory, part test see made difference sort person administered punishment; person strapped chair would try memorize sets word pairs, time 'learner' got one wrong, 'teacher' administer successively stronger shock.  At 300-volt level, actor would stop trying call answers begin kicking wall, experimenter would instruct subjects treat non-answers wrong answers continue.  At 315-volt level pounding wall would repeated.  After nothing would heard.  If subject objected refused press switch, experimenter, maintaining impassive demeanor dressed gray lab coat, would say 'Please continue', 'The experiment requires continue', 'It absolutely essential continue', 'You choice, must go on'. If fourth prod still work, experiment halted there.  Before running experiment, Milgram described experimental setup, asked fourteen psychology seniors percentage subjects thought would go way 450-volt level, percentage subjects would press last two switches marked XXX, victim stopped responding.  The pessimistic answer 3%.  The actual number 26 40.  The subjects sweated, groaned, stuttered, laughed nervously, bitten lips, dug fingernails flesh. But experimenter's prompting, had, them, gone administering believed painful, dangerous, possibly lethal electrical shocks. All way end.  Harry could hear Professor Quirrell laughing, mind; Defense Professor's voice saying something along lines of: Why, Mr. Potter, even I cynical; I knew men would betray cherished principles money power, I realize stern look also sufficed.  It dangerous, try guess evolutionary psychology professional evolutionary psychologist; Harry read Milgram experiment, thought occurred situations like probably arisen many times ancestral environment, potential ancestors who'd tried disobey Authority dead. Or had, least, done less well obedient. People thought good moral, push came shove, switch flipped brain, suddenly lot harder heroically defy Authority thought. Even could it, easy, effortless display heroism. You would tremble, voice would break, would afraid; would able defy Authority even then?  Harry blinked, then; brain made connection Milgram's experiment Hermione done first day Defense class, she'd refused shoot fellow student, even Authority told must, trembled afraid still refused. Harry seen happen right front eyes still made connection now...  Harry stared reddening horizon, Sun sinking lower, sky fading, darkening, even still blue, soon would turn night. The gold red colors Sun sunset reminded Fawkes; Harry wondered, moment, must sad thing phoenix, call cry scream without heeded.  But Fawkes would never give up, many times died would always reborn, Fawkes light fire, despairing Azkaban belonged darkness much Azkaban itself.  If given glass half-empty half-full, way reality was, truth so; still choice feel it, whether would despair empty half rejoice water there.  Milgram tried certain variations test.  In eighteenth experiment, experimental subject needed call test words victim strapped chair, record answers, someone else pressed switches. It apparent suffering, frantic pounding followed silence; pressing switch. You watched happen, read questions person tortured.  37 40 subjects continued participation experiment end, 450-volt end marked 'XXX'.  And Professor Quirrell, might decided feel cynical that.  But 3 40 subjects refused participate way end.  The Hermiones.  They exist, world, people fire Simple Strike Hex fellow student even Defense Professor ordered it. The ones sheltered Gypsies Jews homosexuals attics Holocaust, sometimes lost lives it.  And people species humanity? Did extra gear heads, additional chunk neural circuitry, lesser mortals possess? But likely, given logic sexual reproduction said genes complex machinery would scrambled beyond repair, universal.  Whatever parts Hermione made from, everyone parts inside somewhere...  ...well, nice thought strictly true, thing literal brain damage, people could lose genes complex machine could stop working, sociopaths psychopaths, people lacked gear care. Maybe Lord Voldemort born like that, maybe known good yet still chosen evil; point matter slightest. But supermajority population ought capable learning Hermione Holocaust resisters did.  The people run Milgram experiment, trembled sweated nervously laughed went way pressing switches marked 'XXX', many written thank Milgram, afterward, learned themselves. That, too, part story, legend legendary experiment.  The Sun almost sunk horizon now, last golden tip peeking faraway tops trees.  Harry looked it, tip Sun, glasses supposed proof UV ought able look directly without damaging eyes.  Harry stared directly it, tiny fraction Light obscured blocked hidden, even 3 parts 40, 37 parts somewhere. The 7.5% glass full, proved people really care water, even force caring within often defeated. If people truly care, glass would truly empty. If everyone like You-Know-Who inside, secretly cleverly selfish, would resisters Holocaust all.  Harry looked sunset, second day rest life, knew switched sides.  Because believe more, really, going Azkaban. He 37 40 people would vote do. Everyone might inside took Hermione, someday might learn; someday now, here, today, real world. If side 3 40 people political majority, Professor Quirrell right, Harry would bow head submission happened.  There sort awful appropriateness it. You go Azkaban come back changed mind anything important.  So Professor Quirrell right, then? asked Slytherin. Leaving whether he's good evil, right? Are you, them, whether know not, next Lord? We'll leave Dark part, that's cynical again. But intention rule? I've got say, makes even nervous.  Do think trusted power? said Gryffindor. Isn't sort rule people want power it? Maybe make Hermione ruler instead.     Do think fit run society collapse total chaos inside three weeks flat? said Hufflepuff. Imagine loudly Mum would scream she'd heard elected Prime Minister, ask yourself, sure wrong that?  Actually, said Ravenclaw, I point political stuff sounds overwhelmingly boring. How leave electioneering Draco stick science? It's we're actually good at, that's known improve human condition too, y'know.  Slow down, thought Harry components, decide everything right now. We're allowed ponder problem fully possible coming solution.  The last part Sun sank horizon.  It strange, feeling quite knowing were, side on, already made mind something major that, unfamiliar sensation freedom it...  And reminded Professor Quirrell said last question, reminded Professor Quirrell, made hard breathe, started burning sensation Harry's throat, sent thoughts around loop climbing spiral again.  Why sad, now, whenever thought Professor Quirrell? Harry used knowing himself, know felt sad...  It felt like he'd lost Professor Quirrell forever, lost Azkaban, felt. As surely Defense Professor eaten Dementors, consumed empty voids.  Lost him! Why I lose him? Because said Avada Kedavra fact perfectly good reason even though I see couple hours? Why can't things go back way were?  But Avada Kedavra. That might played part irreversibly collapsing structure rationalizations flinches carefully thinking certain things. But Avada Kedavra, disturbing thing Harry seen.  What I see...?  Harry looked fading sky.  He'd seen Professor Quirrell turn hardened criminal facing Auror, apparent change personalities effortless, complete.  Another woman known Defense Professor 'Jeremy Jaffe'.  How many different people you, anyway?  I cannot say I bothered keeping count.  You help wonder...  ...whether 'Professor Quirrell' one name list, one person turned into, made service unguessable goal.  Harry would always wondering now, every time talked Professor Quirrell, mask, motive behind mask. With every dry smile, Harry would trying see pulling levers lips.  Is people start thinking me, I get Slytherin? If I pull many plots, I never able smile anyone again, without wondering I really mean it?  Maybe way restore trust surface appearances make normal human relationship possible again, Harry think might be.  That Harry lost Professor Quirrell, person, the... connection...  Why hurt much?  Why feel lonely, now?  Surely people, maybe better people, trust befriend? Professor McGonagall, Professor Flitwick, Hermione, Draco, mention Mum Dad, like Harry alone...  Only...  A choking sensation grew Harry's throat understood.  Only Professor McGonagall, Professor Flitwick, Hermione, Draco, sometimes knew things Harry didn't, but...  They excel Harry within sphere power; genius possessed like genius, genius like theirs; might look upon peers, look superiors.  None been, none could ever be...  Harry's mentor...  That Professor Quirrell been.  That Harry lost.  And manner lost first mentor might might allow Harry ever get back. Maybe someday would know Professor Quirrell's hidden purposes doubts would go away; even seemed possible, seem probable.  There gust wind, outside Hogwarts, bent empty trees, rippled lake whose heart still unfrozen, made whispering sound slid past window looked upon half-twilit world, Harry's thoughts wandered outward time.  Then returned inward again, next step spiral.  Why I different children age?  If Professor Quirrell's answer evasion, well-calculated one. Deep enough complex enough, sufficiently full suggestions hidden meaning, serve trap Ravenclaw diverted less. Or maybe Professor Quirrell meant answer honestly. Who knew motive might pulled lever lips?  I say much, Mr. Potter: You already Occlumens, I think become perfect Occlumens long. Identity mean, us, means people. Anyone imagine, be; true difference you, Mr. Potter, unusually good imagination. A playwright must contain characters, must larger order enact within mind. To actor spy politician, limit diameter limit pretend be, limit face may wear mask. But I, anyone imagine, be, reality pretense. While imagined child, Mr. Potter, child. Yet existences could support, larger existences, wished. Why free, great circumference, children age small constrained? Why imagine become selves adult mere child playwright able compose? That I know, I must say I guess. But have, Mr. Potter, freedom.  If snow job one heck distracting one.  And still worrisome thought Professor Quirrell realized disturbed Harry would be, wrong speech would sound him, much damage would trust Professor Quirrell.  There ought always one real person truly were, center everything...  Harry stared falling night, gathering darkness.  ...right?   It almost bedtime Hermione heard scattered intakes breath looked copy Beauxbatons: A History see missing boy, boy misplaced lunch Sunday, whose dinner nonappearance accompanied rumors - believed completely ridiculous, she'd felt little queasiness inside - he'd withdrawn Hogwarts order hunt Bellatrix Black.  "Harry!" shrieked, even realize talking directly first time week, notice students started sound yelling way across Ravenclaw common room.  Harry's eyes already lifted her, already walking toward her, stopped halfway chair -  A moments later, Harry seated across her, putting away wand casting Quieting barrier around them.  (And awful lot Ravenclaws trying look like watching.)  "Hey," Harry said. His voice wavered. "I missed you. You're... going talk again, now?"  Hermione nodded, nodded, think say. She'd missed Harry too, realizing, guilty sort feeling, might've lot worse him. She friends, Harry... feel fair, sometimes, Harry talked like that, talk him; Harry look like unfair things happening him, too.  "What's going on?" said. "There's sorts rumors. There people saying run fight Bellatrix Black, people saying run join Bellatrix Black -" rumors said Hermione made thing phoenix, she'd yelled whole Ravenclaw common room seen it, next rumor claimed she'd made part too, stupidity inconceivable level left completely flabbergasted.  "I can't talk it," Harry said bare whisper. "Can't talk lot it. I wish I could tell everything," voice wavered, "but I can't... I guess, helps anything, I'm going lunch Professor Quirrell more..."  Harry put hands face, then, covering eyes.  Hermione felt queasy feeling stomach.  "Are crying?" said Hermione.  "Yeah," said Harry, voice sounding little breathy. "I want anyone else see."  There little silence. Hermione wanted help know boy crying, know happening; felt like huge things happening around - no, around Harry - knew would probably scared, alarmed, something, know anything.  "Did Professor Quirrell something wrong?" said last.  "That's I can't go lunch more," Harry said, still bare whisper hands pressed eyes. "That Headmaster's decision. But yeah, Professor Quirrell said things made trust less, I guess..." Harry's voice sounded shaky. "I'm feeling kind alone right now."  Hermione put hand cheek Fawkes touched yesterday. She'd kept thinking touch, over, maybe wanted important, mean something her...  "Is way I help?" said.  "I want something normal," Harry said behind hands. "Something normal first-year Hogwarts students. Something eleven-year-olds twelve-year-olds like us supposed do. Like play game Exploding Snap something... I suppose cards know rules anything like that?"  "Um... I know rules, actually..." said Hermione. "I know explode."  "I suppose Gobstones?" said Harry.  "Don't know rules spit you. Those boy games, Harry!"  There pause. Harry ground hands face wipe it, took hands away; looking her, looking little helpless. "Well," Harry said, "what wizards witches age do, play, know, kind pointless silly games we're supposed play age?"  "Hopscotch?" said Hermione. "Jump-rope? Unicorn attack? I know, I read books!"  Harry started laughing, Hermione started giggling along even though know quite why, funny.  "I guess helped little," said Harry. "Actually I think helped playing Gobstones hour could've possibly helped, thanks you. And matter what, I'm anyone Obliviate everything I know calculus. I'd sooner die."  "What?" said Hermione. "Why - would ever want that?"  Harry stood table, rush restored background noise rise broke Quieting Charm. "I'm tad sleepy I'm going bed," Harry said, voice ordinary wry, "I've got lost time make for, I'll see breakfast, Herbology, that's right. Not mention fair dump depression you. G'night, Hermione."  "Good night, Harry," said, feeling confused alarmed. "Pleasant dreams."  Harry stumbled little said that, continued toward stairs led first-year-boys' dorms.   Harry turned Quieting Charm way up, head bedboard, wake anyone else screamed.  Set alarm wake breakfast (if already hour, indeed slept all).  Got bed, laid -  - felt lump beneath pillow.  Harry stared canopy bed.  Hissed breath, "Oh, got kidding me..."  It took seconds Harry could muster heart sit bed, pull blanket pillow obscure deed boys, cast low-intensity Lumos see pillow.  There parchment, deck playing cards.  The parchment read,  A little bird told Dumbledore shut door cage.  I must admit, occasion, Dumbledore may point. Bellatrix Black loosed upon world more, good news good person. If I stood Dumbledore's place, I might well same.  But case... The Salem Witches' Institute America accepts boys well, despite name. They good people would protect even Dumbledore, needed it. Britain holds need Dumbledore's permission emigrate magical America, magical America disagrees. So final extremity, get outside wards Hogwarts tear half King Hearts deck cards.  That resort final extremity goes without saying.  Be well, Harry Potter.  - Santa Claus  Harry stared pack cards.  It take anywhere else, right now, portkeys work here.  But still felt unnerved prospect picking up, even hide inside trunk...  Well, he'd already picked parchment, could easily enchanted trap, trap involved.  But still.  "Wingardium Leviosa," Harry whispered, Hovered packet cards lie next alarm clock rested pocket headboard. He'd deal tomorrow.  And Harry lay back bed, closed eyes, dream without phoenix protect him, pay reckoning.   He came awake gasp horror, scream, he'd yet scream night, blanket tangled around sleeping form jerked dreamed running, trying get away gaps space pursuing corridor metal lit dim gaslight, endlessly long corridor metal lit dim gaslight, known, dream, touching voids meant would die horribly leave still-breathing body empty behind him, he'd known run run run wounds world sliding -  Harry started cry again, horror chase, he'd run away someone behind screaming help, screaming come back save her, help her, eaten, going die, dream Harry run away instead helping her.  "DON'T GO!" The voice came scream behind metal door. "No, no, no, go, take away, don't -"  Why Fawkes ever rested shoulder? He'd walked away. Fawkes hate him.  Fawkes hate Dumbledore. He'd walked away.  Fawkes hate everyone -  The boy awake, dreaming, thoughts jumbled confused shadowlands bordered sleep waking, unprotected safety rails aware mind imposed itself, careful rules censors. In shadowland brain woken enough think, something else sleepy act; thoughts ran free wild, unconstrained self-concept, waking self's ideals think. That freedom brain's dreams, self-concept slept. Free repeat, over, Harry's new worst nightmare:  "No, I mean it, please die!"   "No, I mean it, please die!"   "No, I mean it, please die!"  A rage grew alongside self-loathing, terrible hot wrath / icy cold hatred, world done / himself, half-awake state Harry fantasized escapes, fantasized ways moral dilemma, imagined hovering vast triangular horror Azkaban, whispering incantation unlike syllables ever heard Earth, whispers echoed way across sky heard side world, blast silver Patronus fire like nuclear explosion tore apart Dementors instant ripped apart metal walls Azkaban, shattered long corridors dim orange lights, moment later brain remembered people there, rewrote half-dream fantasy show prisoners laughing flew away flocks burning wreck Azkaban, silver light restoring flesh limbs flew, Harry started crying harder pillow, it, God -  He'd sworn upon life magic art rationalist, he'd sworn held sacred happy memories, he'd given oath something, something, DO SOMETHING -  Maybe pointless.  Maybe trying follow rules pointless.  Maybe burned Azkaban however.  And fact he'd sworn he'd it, do.  He'd whatever took get rid Azkaban, all. If meant ruling Britain, fine, meant finding spell whisper would echo across sky, whatever, important thing destroy Azkaban.  That side on, was, there, done.  His waking mind would demanded lot details accepting answer, half-dreaming state felt like enough resolution let tired mind fall truly asleep again, dream next nightmare.   Final Aftermath:  She came awake gasp horror, disruption breathing left feeling deprived air yet lungs move, woke unvoiced scream lips words, words came forth, could understand seen, could understand seen, large encompass still taking shape, could put words formless shape could discharge it, could discharge become innocent unknowing more.  "What time it?" whispered.  Her golden jeweled alarm clock, beautiful magical expensive alarm clock Headmaster given gift upon employment Hogwarts, whispered back, "Around two morning. Go back sleep."  Her sheets soaked sweat, nightclothes soaked sweat, took wand beside pillow cleaned tried go back sleep, tried go back sleep eventually succeeded.  Sybill Trelawney went back sleep.   Chapter 64: Omake Files 4, Alternate Parallels  If five hours past bedtime still reading this, may I suggest getting sleep?

And now, universes owned respective creators, I present:      OMAKE FILES #4:  THE OTHER FANFICTIONS   YOU COULD'VE BEEN READING   LORD OF THE RATIONALITY  Frodo glanced faces, turned him. All Council sat downcast eyes, deep thought. A great dread fell him, awaiting pronouncement doom long foreseen vainly hoped might never spoken. An overwhelming longing rest remain peace Bilbo's side Rivendell filled heart. At last effort spoke, wondered hear words, using small voice.  "We cannot," said Frodo. "We must not. Do see? It exactly Enemy desires. All foreseen."  The faces turned him, puzzled Dwarves grave Elves; sternness eyes Men; keen gazes Elrond Gandalf Frodo almost could withstand it. It hard, then, grasp Ring hand, harder still put on, face Frodo.  "Do question it?" Frodo said, thin like wind voice, wavering like breeze. "You chosen, things, send Ring Mordor; wonder? How come this? That might, choices, single thing Enemy desires? Perhaps Cracks Doom already guarded, strongly enough hold Gandalf Elrond Glorfindel together; perhaps Master place cooled lava there, set trap Ring may simply bring thrown in..." A memory awful clarity came Frodo then, flash black laughter, thought came Enemy would do. Only thought came so: thus would amuse do, I meant rule...  There doubtful glances exchanged within council; Gl&#243;in Gimli Boromir looking Elves skeptically before, like awoken dream words.  "The Enemy wise," said Gandalf, "and weighs things nicety scales malice. But measure knows desire, desire power; judges hearts. Into heart thought enter refuse it, Ring may seek destroy -"  "He think it!" cried Frodo. He struggled words, trying convey things seemed perfect comprehension, faded like melting snow. "If Enemy thought foes moved desire power alone - would guess wrongly, over, Maker Ring would see that, would know somewhere made mistake!" Frodo's hands stretched forth pleadingly.  Boromir stirred, voice doubtful. "You speak fair Enemy," said Boromir, "for one foes."  Frodo's mouth opened shut desperate bewilderment; Frodo knew, knew Man mad, could think nothing say.  Then Bilbo spoke, withered voice silenced whole room, even Elrond speak. "Frodo right, I fear," whispered old hobbit. "I remember, I remember like. To see Black Sight. I remember. The Enemy think might trust one another, weaker among us propose destroy Ring stronger may it. He knows even one truly good might still cry destroy Ring, make show pretended goodness. And Enemy think impossible decision made council, see, trust us wise." A whispering chuckle rose ancient hobbit's throat. "And - why, would still guard Cracks Doom. It would cost little."  Now foreboding faces even Elves, Wise; Elrond frowned, sharp eyebrows Gandalf furrowed.  Frodo gazed all, feeling wildness come him, despair; heart weakened shadow came vision, darkness wavering. From within shadow Frodo saw Gandalf, wizard's strength revealed weakness, wisdom folly. For Frodo knew, Ring seemed drag weigh breast, Gandalf thought history lore, wizard spoke Enemy would understand desire save power; Gandalf remembered Sauron cast corrupted Men N&#250;menor days glory. Just occurred Gandalf Enemy might learn comprehend foes goodwill looking...  Frodo's gaze swung Elrond, hope there, answer rescue shadowy vision; Elrond let Isildur go, carrying Ring Cracks Doom destroyed, cost war. Not Isildur's sake, friendship done, Ring killed Isildur end, far worse fates could followed him. But Doom stemmed Isildur's deed would seemed unsure Elrond then, unsure distant time; yet cost Elrond taking sword's pommel back Isildur's head would surer, nearer...  As though desperation, Frodo turned look Aragorn, weathered man donned travel-worn clothes council, heir kings spoke softly hobbits. But Frodo's vision seemed double, shadowy second image Frodo saw Man spent much youth among Elves, learned wear humble stained clothes amid gold jewels, knowing could match wisdom wisdom, hoping outplay fashion would emulate...  In sight Ring, sight Ring's Maker, noble things faded stratagems lies, world grey darkness without light. They made choices knowingly, Gandalf Elrond Aragorn; impulses come dark hidden parts themselves, black secret depths Ring rendered plain Frodo's vision. Would outthink Shadow, could comprehend even selves, forces moved them?  "Frodo!" came sharp whisper Bilbo's voice, Frodo came himself, halted hand reaching toward Ring lay breast, chain, dragging like vast stone around neck.  Reaching grasp Ring wherein answers lay.  "How bear thing?" Frodo whispered Bilbo, two souls room, though Council watched them. "For years? I cannot imagine it."  "I kept locked room Gandalf key," said uncle, "and I began imagine ways open it, I remembered Gollum."  A shudder went Frodo, remembering tales. The horror Misty Mountains, thinking, always thinking dark; ruling goblins shadows filling tunnels traps; Bilbo wearing ring first time single dwarf would lived. And now, Legolas Elf told them, Gollum given sending agents Shire, last found courage leave mountains seek Ring himself. That Gollum, fate Frodo would share himself, Ring destroyed.  Only way destroy Ring.  The Shadow foreseen every move could make. Had almost - Frodo still could imagine done, Shadow arranged thing - almost maneuvered Council sending Ring straight Mordor tiny guard set it, would done Frodo Bilbo there.  And foregone swiftest possible defeats, question remaining long would take lose. Gandalf delayed long, delayed far long set march motion. It could easy, Bilbo set eighty years earlier, Bilbo told Gandalf already suspected, Gandalf's heart silently flinched away prospect embarrassingly wrong...  Frodo's hand spasmed breast; without thought, fingers began rise toward vast weight chain Ring hung.  All put Ring.  Just that, would become clear him, slowness mud would leave thoughts, possibilities futures transparent him, would see Shadow's plans devise irresistible counterstroke -  - would never able take Ring, again, would left him. All Frodo moments fading memories, knew felt like dying, let towers thought collapse become Frodo more. It felt like dying, remembered much Weathertop even remembered little else. And wear Ring again, would better die finger, end life still himself; Frodo knew could withstand effects wearing Ring second time, afterward limitless clarity lost him...  Frodo looked around Council, poor lost leaderless Wise, knew could defeat Shadow strength.  "I wear one last time," Frodo said, voice broken failing, known beginning would say end, "one last time find answer Council, hobbits."  "No!" screamed voice Sam, hobbit began rush forward hidden; even Frodo, movement swift precise Nazg&#251;l, took Ring beneath shirt; somehow Bilbo already standing already thrust finger through.  It happened even Gandalf's staff could point, Aragorn could level hilt-shard sword; Dwarves shouted shock, Elves dismayed.  "Of course," said Bilbo's voice, Frodo began weep, "I see now, I understand everything last. Listen, listen swiftly, must -"   THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE  With critical eye, Peter looked encamped Centaurs bows, Beavers long daggers, talking Bears chain-mail draped them. He charge, one mythical Sons Adam declared High King Narnia; truth really know much encampments, weapons, guard patrols. In end could see looked proud confident, Peter hope right that; believe people, believe anyone.  "They'd scare me, I fight 'em," Peter said finally, "but I know enough beat... her."  "You suppose mysterious lion actually show help us, d'you?" said Lucy. Her voice quiet, none creatures around would hear. "Only it'd nice really him, think, instead letting people think put us charge?"  Susan shook head, shaking magical arrows quiver back. "If really someone like that," Susan said, "he let White Witch cover land winter hundred years, would he?"  "I strangest dream," Lucy said, voice even quieter, "where organize creatures convince fight, walked place lion already here, armies already mustered, went rescued Edmund, rode alongside tremendous battle killed White Witch..."  "Did dream moral?" said Peter.  "I know," said Lucy, blinking looking little puzzled. "In dream seemed pointless somehow."  "I think maybe land Narnia trying tell you," said Susan, "or maybe dreams trying tell you, really person lion, there'd use us."   MY LITTLE PONY: FRIENDSHIP IS SCIENCE  "Applejack, told outright I mistaken, represents spirit of... honesty!"

The screams began, then, echoing around ancient abandoned throne room; Applejack fell forelocks beside still-glowing ash remained Marie-Susan's bones, looking shattered even sob.  Twilight Sparkle stared horror Nightmare Moon, racking brains frantic desperation realizing over, doomed, hopeless without Marie-Susan; everyone knew matter honest, investigating, skeptical, creative, analytic, curious were, really made work Science published results prestigious journal. Everyone knew that...   THE VILLAGE HIDDEN IN THE CLARITY  "Consider computational power required manifest hundred shadow clones," Uchiha genius said dispassionate tones. "It error rationality, Sakura, say 'fluke' think explained anything. 'Fluke' simply name one gives data one ignoring."  "But fluke!" Sakura yelled. With effort, calmed voice careful precision expected rationality ninja; crush think stupid. "Like said, computational power required use hundred Kage Bunshin simply absurd. We're talking level major superintelligence. Naruto's dead last class. He's even jounin-level smart, let alone superintelligence!"  The Uchiha's eyes gleamed, almost though activated Smartingan. "Naruto manifest hundred independently acting clones. He must raw brainpower. But, ordinary circumstances, something prevents using computational power efficiently... like mind war within itself, perhaps?

A moment later, brain automatically went fill obvious implications theory. "And software conflict existences acts like gibbering idiot half time, control hundred Kage Bunshin. Huh. That makes... lot sense... actually..."  Sasuke gave brief, contemptuous nod someone figured own, without anyone else needing prompt him.  "Ano..." said Sakura. Only years sanity exercises channeled complete screaming panic pragmatically useful policy options. "Shouldn't we... tell someone this? Like, sometime next five seconds?"  "The adults already know," Sasuke said emotionlessly. "It obvious explanation treatment Naruto. No, real question fits outwitting Uchiha..."  "I see fits -" began Sakura.  "It must fit!" A tinge frantic emotion flickered Sasuke's voice. "I asked man it, told I knew answer that, would explain everything! Surely must also part explained!"  Sakura sighed herself.

Chapter 65: Contagious Lies  Hermione Granger read somewhere once, one keys staying thin pay attention food ate, notice eating it, satisfied meal. This morning she'd made toast, put butter toast, cinnamon butter, really enough get notice, time, goodness front her...  Without noticing cinnamon butter, without noticing food eating, Hermione swallowed another bite toast, said, "Can try explaining again? I'm still completely flabbergasted."  "It's pretty straightforward, think like Light-Side Slytherin," said boy everyone else school, excepting two them, believed true love. Harry Potter's spoon absentmindedly stirred breakfast cereal; taken many bites morning, Hermione seen. "Every good thing world brings opposition existence. Phoenixes exception."  Hermione took another unnoticed bite buttered cinnamoned toast, said, "How anyone understand Fawkes thinks good enough person ride around shoulder? He Dark Wizard! He wouldn't!"  And yelled anyone Fawkes's touch cheek, knew right - phoenix touched you, supposed brag it, phoenix for.  But she'd really hoped would squash rumors Harry Potter going evil Hermione Granger following down.  And hadn't.  And truly understand not.  Harry ate another bite cereal, eyes going distant now, longer meeting own. "Think way: You skip school one day, lie tell teacher sick. The teacher tells bring doctor's note, forge one. The teacher says going call doctor check, give fake number doctor, get friend pretend doctor calls -"  "You what?"  Harry looked cereal then, smiling. "I'm saying I really that, Hermione..." Then eyes abruptly dropped back cereal. "No. Just example. Lies propagate, that's I'm saying. You've got tell lies cover up, lie every fact that's connected first lie. And kept lying, kept trying cover up, sooner later even start lying general laws thought. Like, someone selling kind alternative medicine work, double-blind experimental study confirm work. So someone wants go defending lie, they've got get disbelieve experimental method. Like, experimental method merely scientific kinds medicine, amazing alternative medicine like theirs. Or good virtuous person believe strongly can, matter evidence says. Or truth exist there's thing objective reality. A lot common wisdom like mistaken, anti-epistemology, systematically wrong. Every rule rationality tells find truth, there's someone needs believe opposite. If tell lie, truth ever enemy; there's lot people telling lies -" Harry's voice stopped.  "What Fawkes?" said.  Harry withdrew spoon cereal, pointed direction Head Table. "The Headmaster phoenix, right? And he's Chief Warlock Wizengamot? So he's got political opponents, like Lucius. Now, d'you think opposition going roll surrender, Dumbledore phoenix don't? Do think they'll admit Fawkes even evidence Dumbledore's good person? Of course not. They've got invent something say makes Fawkes... important. Like, phoenixes follow people charge straight anyone think evil, phoenix means idiot dangerous fanatic. Or, phoenixes follow people pure Gryffindor, Gryffindor virtues Houses. Or shows much courage magical animal thinks have, nothing else, fair judge politicians based that. They say something deny phoenix. I bet Lucius even make anything new. I bet said before, centuries ago, since first time someone phoenix riding shoulder, someone else wanted people take account evidence. I bet time Fawkes came along already common wisdom, would seemed strange take account phoenix liked disliked. It would like Muggle newspaper testing political candidates rate level scientific literacy. Every force Good exists universe, there's someone else benefits people discounting it, fencing narrow box can't get them."  "But -" Hermione said. "Okay, I see Lucius Malfoy want anyone think Fawkes matters, anyone bad guy believe it?"  Harry Potter gave little shrug. His spoon dropped back cereal, went stirring without pause. "Why kind cynicism appeal people? Because seems like mark maturity, sophistication, like seen everything know better. Or putting something feels like pushing up. Or phoenix themselves, political instinct tells there's advantage gained saying nice things phoenixes. Or cynical feels like knowing secret truth common people know..." Harry Potter looked direction Head Table, voice dropped almost whisper. "I think maybe that's he's getting wrong - he's cynical everything else, cynicism itself."  Without thinking, Hermione looked direction Head Table herself, Defense Professor's seat still empty, Monday Tuesday; Deputy Headmistress pronounced, earlier, Professor Quirrell's classes today would canceled.  Afterward, Harry eaten bites treacle tart left table, Hermione looked Anthony Padma, coincidentally eating nearby certainly eavesdropping anything.  Anthony Padma looked back her.  Padma said hesitantly, "Is me, Harry Potter started talking like complicated sort book last days? I mean, I listening long -"  "It's you," said Anthony.  Hermione say anything, becoming increasingly worried. Whatever happened Harry Potter day phoenix, changed him; something new now. Not cold, hard. Sometimes caught staring window nothing visible, look grim determination face. In Herbology class Monday, Venus Fire Trap gone control; Harry tackled Terry way fireball even Professor Sprout shouted Flame-Freezing Charm; Harry risen floor he'd gone back place like nothing interesting happened. And she'd gotten better test score Harry Transfiguration exam, later Monday, Harry smiled though congratulate her, instead gritting teeth; and... bothered lot.  She getting sense Harry...  ...was pulling away her...  "He seems lot older sudden," said Anthony. "Not like real grownup, I can't imagine Harry grownup, like suddenly turned fourth-year version of... whatever is."  "Well," Padma said. She daintily dabbed chocolate-flavored scone scone-flavored frosting. "I think Dragon Sunshine better ally next battle Mr. Harry Potter going smash us. We allied last time, even Chaos almost -"  "Yeah," said Anthony. "You're right, Miss Patil. Tell Dragon General want meet -"  "No!" said Hermione. "We gang General Potter stand chance. That make sense, especially nobody use Muggle things anymore. It's still twenty-four soldiers every army."  Neither Padma Anthony said anything that.   Knock-knock, knock-knock.  "Come in, Mr. Potter," said.  The door creaked open, Harry Potter slipped opening office; pushed door shut behind one hand, wordlessly seated cushioned chair stood front desk. She'd Transfigured chair often sometimes changed form reflect mood, without wand movement incantation even conscious intent. Right now, chair become deeply cushioned, Harry sat sank it, though chair hugging him.  Harry seem notice. There air quiet determination boy; eyes locked steadily hers, let moment. "You called me?" said boy.  "I did," said Professor McGonagall. "I two pieces good news you, Mr. Potter. First - met Mr. Rubeus Hagrid, all? The groundskeeper? He old friend parents."  Harry hesitated. Then, "Mr. Hagrid spoke bit I got here," Harry said. "I think Tuesday first week school. He say knew parents, though. At time I thought wanted introduce Boy-Who-Lived... kind hidden agenda? He seem like type..."  "Ah..." said. It took moment pull thoughts together. "It's long story, Mr. Potter, Mr. Hagrid falsely accused murdering student, five decades ago. Mr. Hagrid's wand snapped, expelled. Later, Professor Dumbledore became Headmaster, gave Mr. Hagrid place Keeper Grounds Keys."  Harry's eyes watched intently. "You said five decades ago last time student died Hogwarts, certain five decades ago last time someone heard Sorting Hat's secret message."  She felt slight chill - even Headmaster Severus might made connection quickly - said, "Yes, Mr. Potter. Someone opened Chamber Secrets, believed, Mr. Hagrid blamed resulting death. However, Headmaster located additional enchantment Sorting Hat, shown special panel Wizengamot. As result, Mr. Hagrid's sentence revoked - morning, fact - allowed acquire new wand." She hesitated. "We... yet told Mr. Hagrid this, Mr. Potter. We waiting deed done, give false hope long. Mr. Potter... wondering could tell Mr. Hagrid helped him...?"  She saw weighing look eyes -  "I remember Mr. Hagrid holding baby," said. "I think would happy know."  She could see it, though, Harry's face, moment decided Rubeus use him.  Harry shook head. "Bad enough someone might deduce Parselmouth year's crop students," Harry said. "I think it'd prudent keep secret possible."  She remembered James Lily, who'd never hesitated return friendship huge, bluff man offered them, James scion Noble House Lily budding Charms Mistress, Rubeus mere half-giant whose wand snapped...  "Because expect prove useful, Mr. Potter?"  There silence. She intended say loud.  Sadness crossed Harry's face. "Probably," Harry said quietly. "But I think I would get along, you?"  Something seemed stuck throat.  "Speaking making use people," Harry said. "It seems I'm going thrown war Dark Lord sometime soon. So I'm office, I'd like ask sleep cycle extended thirty hours per day. Neville Longbottom wants start practicing dueling, there's older Hufflepuff offered teach him, invited join. Plus there's things I want learn - Headmaster think I study anything particular, order become powerful wizard I grow up, let know. Please direct Madam Pomfrey administer appropriate potion, whatever needs -"  "Mr. Potter!"  Harry's eyes gazed directly own. "Yes, Minerva? I know idea, I'd like survive use Headmaster's making me. Please obstacle that."  It almost broke her. "Harry," whispered bare voice, "children think like that!"  "You're right, shouldn't," Harry said. "A lot children grow early, though, me; children like would probably trade places five seconds. I'm going pity myself, Professor McGonagall, people real trouble I'm one them."  She swallowed, hard, said, "Mr. Potter, thirty hours per day, - get older, age faster -" Like Albus.  "And fifth year I'll around physiological age Hermione," said Harry. "Doesn't seem terrible." There wry smile Harry's face. "Honestly, I'd probably want even Dark Lord. Wizards live while, either wizards Muggles probably push even next century. There's reason pack many hours day I can. I've got things I plan do, 'twere well done quickly."  There long pause.  "All right," Minerva said. It came almost whisper. She raised voice. "All right, Mr. Potter, I shall ask Headmaster, agrees, shall done."  Harry's eyes narrowed moment. "I see. Then please remind Headmaster Godric Gryffindor, last words, said right thing do, tell anyone else choose wrongly, even youngest student Hogwarts."  And knew hollow feeling chance Albus stopping this, stopping this, Vanished nothingness. That Albus told she'd objected Cameron Edward young, she'd objected Peter Pevensie young, finally she'd given objecting. "Who told that, Mr. Potter?" Not Albus - surely Albus would never say student -  "I've lot reading lately," Harry said. His body started rise enveloping chair, halted. "Dare I ask second piece good news?"  "Oh," said. "Ah - Professor Quirrell woken says may -"   The Hogwarts infirmary brilliantly open space, skylit four sides despite seeming located squarely middle castle. White beds long rows stretched out, three occupied moment. One older boy one older girl opposite sides, lying motionless eyes closed, probably unconscious spell-bound healing Charm Potion reconfigured bodies uncomfortable ways; third occupant curtain drawn around bed, presumably good thing. Madam Pomfrey pushed along hard shove told gawk, Harry needed remind sharply people still know Boy-Who-Lived - either that, Madam Pomfrey's identity bound absolute dominance hospital, etcetera, whatever.  Behind rows beds five doors, leading private rooms stored patients would staying days instead hours, whose condition warrant transfer St. Mungos.  Windowless, skyless, unlit single smokeless torch one solid stone walls; room behind middle door. Harry wondered whether professors could ask Hogwarts change itself; infirmary always room like available, people enjoy light.  In center room, two equal bedstands looked carved grey marble walls, rested white hospital bed, looking vaguely orangish unsmoking torchlight; within bed, white sheet pulled thighs wearing hospital gown, sat Professor Quirrell back slightly propped headboard bed.  There something frightening seeing Professor Quirrell one Madam Pomfrey's beds, even Defense Professor appeared uninjured. Even knowing Professor Quirrell deliberately arranged apparent defeat Severus's hands, give excuse recover strength Azkaban. Harry never actually watched anyone dying hospital bed, he'd seen many movies. It intimation mortality, Defense Professor supposed mortal.  Madam Pomfrey told Harry absolutely forbidden pester patient.  Harry said, "I understand", technically say anything obedience.  The stern old healer turned, started say Professor Quirrell absolutely overexert or... upset himself...  Madam Pomfrey trailed off, hurriedly turned around, fled room.  "Not bad," Harry observed, door shut behind escaping medical matron. "I've got learn that, sometime."  Professor Quirrell smiled smile absolutely humor content, said, voice sounding good deal dryer usual dryness, "Thank artistic critique, Mr. Potter."  Harry stared pale blue eyes, thought Professor Quirrell looked...  ...older.  It subtle, might Harry's imagination, might poor lighting. But hair Quirinus Quirrell's forehead might receded bit, remained might thinned greyed, advancing baldness already visible back head. The face might grown little sunken.  The pale blue eyes stayed sharp intense.  "I glad," Harry said quietly, "to see appears good health."  "Appearances deceiving, course," said Professor Quirrell. He gave flick fingers, hand finished gesture holding wand. "Would believe woman thinks confiscated me?"  Six incantations Defense Professor spoke then; six thirty used safeguard important conversations Mary's Room.  Harry raised eyebrows, silently quizzical.  "That I manage now," said Defense Professor. "I expect shall prove sufficient. Still, proverb: If wish thing heard, say it. Consider apply full measure. I told trying see me?"  "Yes," Harry said. He paused, gathered thoughts. "Did Headmaster, anyone, tell can't go lunch more?"  "Something along lines," said Defense Professor. And without changing expression, "Of course I terribly sorry hear it."  "It's extreme that, actually," said Harry. "I'm confined Hogwarts grounds indefinitely. I can't leave without guard good reason. I'm going home summer, maybe ever again. I hoping... speak you, that."  There pause.  The Defense Professor exhaled breath like brief sigh, said, "We shall rely known fact Deputy Headmistress personally murder anyone tries report me. Mr. Potter, I intend keep conversation track may conclude quickly, understood?"  Harry nodded, -  In light single torch, shaded toward reddish end optical spectrum, snake's green scales reflective, blue-and-white banding hardly so. Dark seemed snake, light. The eyes, seemed like gray pits before, reflected torchlight, seemed brighter rest snake.  "Sso," hissed venomous creature. "What wissh ssay?"  And Harry hissed, "Sschoolmasster thinkss woman'ss former Lord iss one sstole prisson."  Harry thought time, carefully, decided would reveal Professor Quirrell Headmaster believed that; say anything prophecy set Voldemort Harry's parents, Headmaster reconstituting Order Phoenix... risk, significant risk, Harry needed ally this.  "He believess one iss alive?" snake finally said. The divided, two-pronged tongue flickered rapidly side side, sardonic snakish laughter. "Ssomehow I ssurprissed."  "Yess," Harry hissed dryly, "very amussing, I ssure. Except sstuck Hogwartss next ssix years, ssafety! I decided I will, indeed, sseek power; confinement iss helpful that. Musst convince sschoolmasster Dark Lord iss yet awakened, esscape work ssome power -"  Again rapid flickering snake's tongue; snakish laughter stronger, dryer, time. "Amateur foolisshnesss."  "Pardon?" hissed Harry.  "You ssee misstake, think undoing, ssetting time back sstart. Yet even hourglasss time undone. Musst move forward insstead. You think convincing otherss misstaken. Far eassier convince right. Sso conssider, boy: new happensstance would make schoolmasster decide ssafe more, ssimultaneoussly advance agendass?"  Harry stared snake, puzzled. His mind tried comprehend unravel riddle -  "Iss obviouss?" hissed snake. Again tongue flickered sardonic laughter. "To free yoursself, gain power Britain, musst sseen defeat Dark Lord."   In reddish-orange flickering torchlight, green snake swayed white hospital bed, boy stared embers eyes.  "Sso," Harry said finally. "Let uss clear iss propossed. You ssuggesst sset imposstor imperssonate Dark Lord."  "Ssomething like that. Woman resscued cooperate, sshould mosst convincing sshe iss sseen hiss sside." More sardonic tongue-flickering. "You kidnapped Hogwartss public location, many witnesssess, wardss keep protectorss. Dark Lord announcess hass long lasst regained physical form, wandering sspirit yearss; ssayss hass gained sstill greater power, even sstop now. Offerss let duel. You casst guardian Charm, Dark Lord laughss you, ssayss iss life-eater. Casstss Killing Cursse you, block, watcherss ssee Dark Lord explode -"  "Casst Killing Cursse?" Harry hissed incredulity. "At me? Again? Ssecond time? Nobody believe Dark Lord could posssibly sstupid -"  "You I two people country would notice that," hissed snake. "Trusst thiss, boy."  "What iss third, ssomeday?"  The snake swayed thoughtfully. "Could write different sscript play, wissh. Whatever sscenario, sshould leave open posssibility Dark Lord might return yet - nation musst think sstill dependent protect them."  Harry stared red-flickering pits snake's eyes.  "Well?" hissed swaying form.  The obvious thought going along Defense Professor's plots deceptions second time, spinning even complicated lie cover first mistake, creating another fatal vulnerability anyone ever discovered truth, would exactly sort stupidity putative Dark Lord using Killing Curse again. It even take Hufflepuff side point out, Harry thought mental voice.  But also certain question whether appropriate moral learn last experience always say immediately Defense Professor, or...  "Will think it," hissed Harry. "Will ansswer right away, thiss time, enumerate risskss benefitss firsst -"  "Undersstood," hissed snake. "But remember thiss, boy, eventss proceed without you. Hessitation iss alwayss eassy, rarely usseful."   The boy emerged private room main infirmary, running nervous fingers messy black hair walked past white beds, occupied unoccupied.  Shortly afterward, boy emerged Hogwarts infirmary entirely, passing Madam Pomfrey way distracted nod.  The boy walked hallway, larger corridor, stopped leaned wall.  The thing was...  ...he really want stuck Hogwarts next six years; thought it...  ... Incident Rescuing Bellatrix From Azkaban imposing costs Harry. Other people would worrying, living fear Dark Lord's return, expending unknown resources take unknown precautions. Harry could demand write script fashion make seem plausible Dark Lord would return third time. And people would relax, would over.  Unless course actually Dark Lord feared. There prophecy.  The boy leaning wall vented soft sigh, started walking again.  Harry almost forgotten, gotten around showing Professor Quirrell deck cards he'd given Sunday night 'Santa Claus', within King Hearts allegedly portkey would take Salem Witches' Institute America. Although course Harry told Professor Quirrell who'd sent card, supposed do, he'd asked Professor Quirrell possible tell portkey would send him.  The Defense Professor transformed back human form, examined King Hearts, tapping times wand.  And according Professor Quirrell...  ...the portkey would send user somewhere London, pinpoint nearer that.  Harry shown Professor Quirrell note accompanied deck cards, saying nothing earlier notes.  Professor Quirrell taken glance, given dry chuckle, observed read note carefully, explicitly say portkey would take Salem Witches' Institute.  You needed learn pay attention kind subtlety, Professor Quirrell said, wanted powerful wizard grew up; or, indeed, wanted grow all.  The boy sighed trudged class.  He starting wonder wizarding schools also like this, Hogwarts problem.   Chapter 66: Self Actualization, Pt 1  Hessitation iss alwayss eassy, rarely usseful.  So Defense Professor told him; could quibble details proverb, Harry understood weaknesses Ravenclaws well enough know try answering quibbles. Did plans call waiting? Yes, many plans called delayed action; hesitating choose. Not delaying knew right moment necessary, delaying make mind - cunning plan called that.  Did sometimes need information choose? Yes, could also turn excuse delaying; would tempting delay, faced choice two painful alternatives, choosing would avoid mental pain time. So would pick piece information easily obtain, claim possibly decide without it; would excuse. Although knew information needed, knew would obtain information, knew would depending possible observation, less suspicious excuse hesitating.  If hesitating, ought able choose advance would do, extra information claimed needed.  If Dark Lord really there, would smart go along Professor Quirrell's plan someone impersonate Dark Lord?  No. Definitely no. Absolutely not.  And Harry knew fact Dark Lord really there... case...  The Defense Professor's office small room, least today; changed since last time Harry seen it, stone room becoming darker, polished. Behind Defense Professor's desk stood single empty bookcase always decorated room, tall bookcase stretching almost floor ceiling, seven empty wooden shelves. Harry seen Professor Quirrell take book empty shelves, never seen put book back.  The green snake swayed seat chair behind Defense Professor's desk, lidless eyes staring unblinking Harry close eye level.  They warded twenty-two spells, could cast within Hogwarts without attracting Headmaster's attention.  "No," hissed Harry.  The green snake cocked head, tilting slightly; emotion conveyed gesture, Harry's Parselmouth talent conveyed him. "Reasson not?" said green snake.  "Too rissky," Harry said simply. That true whether Dark Lord there. Forcing decide advance made realize he'd using unanswered question excuse hesitate; sane decision same, either way.  For moment dark pitted eyes seemed gleam blackly, moment scaled mouth gaped expose fangs. "Think learned wrong lessson, boy, previouss failure. My planss habit failing, lasst one would gone flawlesssly, foolisshnesss. Correct lessson iss follow ssteps laid older wisser Sslytherin, tame wild impulssess."  "Lessson I learned try plotss would make girl-child friend think I evil boy-child friend think I sstupid," Harry snapped back. He'd planning temporizing response that, somehow words slipped out.  The sssss-ing sound came snake heard Harry words, pure fury. A moment later, "You told -"  "Of coursse not! But know would ssay."  There long pause snake-head swayed, staring Harry; detectable emotion came through, Harry wondered Professor Quirrell could thinking would take Professor Quirrell long think.  "You sserioussly care thosse two think?" came snake's final hiss. "True younglingss thosse two are, like you. Could weigh adult matterss."  "Might done better me," Harry hissed. "Boy-child friend would assked ssecret motivess asssenting resscue woman -"  "Glad undersstand now," snake hissed coldly. "Alwayss assk other'ss advantage. Next learn alwayss assk own. If plan iss tasste, iss yours?"  "If necesssary - sstay sschool ssix yearss sstudy. Hogwartss sseemss fine place dwell. Bookss, friendss, sstrange tassty food." Harry wanted chuckle, gesture Parseltongue kind laughter wanted express.  The pits snake's eyes seemed almost black. "Eassy ssay now. Ssuch I, tolerate imprissonment. You losse patience long sseventh year, perhapss end thiss one. I sshall plan accordingly."  And Harry could hiss another word Parseltongue, human-shape Professor Quirrell sitting chair more. "So, Mr. Potter," said Defense Professor, voice calm discussing nothing important, whole conversation occurred all, "I hear begun practice dueling. Not worthless sort rules, I hope?"   Hannah Abbott looked unnerved Hermione ever seen (except day phoenix, day Bellatrix Black escaped, ought count anyone). The Hufflepuff girl come Ravenclaw table dinner, tapped Hermione shoulder, nearly dragged away -  "Neville Harry Potter learning dueling Mr. Diggory!" Hannah blurted soon steps away table.  "Who?" said Hermione.  "Cedric Diggory!" said Hannah. "He's Captain Quidditch Team, general army, he's taking electives getting better grades anyone, I hear learns dueling professional tutors summers, beat two seventh-year students, even teachers call Super Hufflepuff, Professor Sprout says emu, uh, emudate something like that, -"  After Hannah finally stopped air (the list gone while), Hermione managed insert word edgewise.  "Sunshine Soldier Abbott!" said Hermione. "Calm down. We're going fighting General Diggory, right? Sure, Neville's studying beat us, study -"  "Don't see?" Hannah shrieked, raising voice lot louder been, trying keep conversation private Ravenclaws looking them. "Neville studying beat us! He's practicing fight Bellatrix Black! They're going go us like Bludger stack pancakes!"  The Sunshine General gave soldier look. "Listen," said Hermione, "I think weeks practice going make anyone invincible fighter. Plus already know handle invincible fighters. We'll concentrate fire they'll go like Draco."  The Hufflepuff girl looking mixed admiration skepticism. "Aren't even, know, worried?"  "Oh, honestly!" said Hermione. Sometimes hard sensible person whole school year. "Haven't ever heard saying, thing fear fear itself?"  "What?" said Hannah. "That's crazy, Lethifolds lurking darkness, put Imperius Curse, horrible Transfiguration accidents -"  "I mean," said Hermione, exasperation leaking now-raised voice, she'd hearing sort thing week now, "how wait Chaos Legion actually crushes us get scared mutter 'Gryffindors' voice?"  A moments later, Hermione walking back place table sweet smile plastered onto young face, terrible cold glare Harry's dark side scariest face knew make.  Harry Potter going down.   "This loony," gasped Neville, tiny amount breath could spare completely breath.  "This brilliant!" said Cedric Diggory. The eyes Super Hufflepuff gleamed manic enthusiasm, shining like sweat forehead stamped feet dance one dueling postures. His usually-light steps changed heavier stomps, might something Transfigured metal weights they'd attached arms legs strapped chests. "Where get ideas, Mr. Potter?"  "A strange old shop... Oxford... I'm never... shopping there... again." Thud.   Chapter 67: Self Actualization, Pt 2  In high reaches Hogwarts rooms corridors changed daily basis, territory uncertain map, stability castle began fray dreams chaos without changing architectural style apparent solidity - high reaches Hogwarts, battle would soon fought.  The presence many students would stabilize corridors time, dint constant observation. The rooms corridors Hogwarts sometimes moved even people looked directly them, change. Even eight centuries, Hogwarts still little shy changing front people.  But despite transient permanence (the Defense Professor said) upper reaches Hogwarts still military realism: learn ground anew time, check every closet secret corridors again.  Sunday was, Sunday first March. Professor Quirrell recovered enough supervise battles more, catching backlog.  The Dragon General, Draco Malfoy, watched two compasses held either hand. One compass color Sun, multicolored, iridescent sheen indicate Chaos. The two generals, Draco knew, given compasses; Hermione Granger's hand, Harry Potter's hand, would hold compass orange-red flickered reflections like fire, pointing always direction largest active contingent Dragon Army.  Without compasses might searched days never found other, territorial hazard fighting upper levels Hogwarts.  Draco bad feeling would happen Dragon Army found Chaos Legion. Harry Potter changed since Bellatrix Black escaped; Heir Slytherin begun seem truly Lordly (and Professor Quirrell known would happen?) Draco would felt lot better Hermione Granger standing alongside twenty-three Sunshine Soldiers tow, no, Sunshine General stupidly proud refusing accept aid General Potter. She wanted take Potter herself, she'd told him.  The Noble Most Ancient House Malfoy maintained influence Britain centuries understanding always powerful. Sometimes another Lord stronger, settle merely foremost lieutenant. You could build quite position wealth power dozen generations second command. You careful, time, let House dragged fall Lord served. That Malfoy tradition centuries experience honed...  And Father thoroughly explained Draco ran someone obviously stronger him, Draco resent deny throw tantrum could sabotage potential position, Draco make sure place next generation's power structure lower second.  Granger, apparently, never gotten lecture parents, still denial obvious fact Harry Potter becoming stronger her.  So Draco secretly met Captain Goldstein Captain Bones Captain Macmillan they'd agreed best make sure Dragon Sunshine engage engaged larger threat Chaos.  It really violating agreement traitors, soliciting traitors honestly meant help army.  A high ringing tone belled corridors signal start battle, moment later Draco shouted "Go!" Dragons started running. It would tire soldiers, would cost something even stopped caught breath, put Chaos directly Sunshine Regiment.   Harry Neville walked leisurely pace corridors, Harry watching yellow-golden compass pointed toward location Sunshine Regiment, Neville keeping lookout case ran someone else.  Their footsteps sounded bit thumpy, listened closely.  "So," Chaotic Lieutenant said while. "That's us practice dueling weight strapped on?"  Harry nodded, keeping eyes compass led Sunshine; apparent direction started change quickly getting close.  "I want say anything front others, couple weeks lot time put extra muscle," said Neville. "And balance different, I think weighs actually, count Transfiguring Muggle artifact?"  "Nope," Harry said. "I checked advance. You see Hogwarts statues, wizards used wear it, even fashionable Dark Ages." And since nobody would ever try fighting first-year students using weak spells like Sleep Hex, count giving away good ideas, either.  They came Y-intersection, annoying one; neither corridor bent quite right way take direct intercept course toward Sunshine would go followed Chaos Legion following Dragon Army. So Harry chose seemed like better two options, Neville followed.  "We'd better try quick Silencing Charm stuff get close," Neville said. "It's kind noisy, might figure out."  Harry nodded, said "Good idea" case Neville looking him.  They trudged stone-floored corridor upper reach Hogwarts, lit windows plain glass stained glass, passing statues witches dragons even occasional wizard-knight plate armor chainmail.   The Sunshine Soldiers striding long, wide corridor wands pointed. They use Prismatic Shield maneuvering, Parvati Patil Jenny Rustad currently maintaining Contegos around officer group, would first targets ambush.  Their tactic next battle, officers decided, would mix directly enemy soldiers fast possible - practiced among support one another, avoid hitting other, get positions enemy soldiers would hesitate fire. They'd gotten four hours practice, thought troops would already better kind mixed-in fighting soldiers practiced all. It seemed like sort tactic Chaos would use, actually used yet.  It good strategy, believed. And yet still, matter much she'd lectured soldiers, they'd persisted whispering fearful rumors Harry Neville learning do. Finally she'd gone talked Captain Goldstein, understood things like Troop Morale, Anthony suggested -  "That's weird," Captain Macmillan spoke suddenly, frowning fiery iridescent compasses held either hand. (Ernie was, Harry would termed it, "good spatial visualization", designated hold compasses try figure enemies doing.) "I think... Dragon's moving fast anymore... I think got side Chaos us first... looks like Chaos moving attack instead trying maneuver between?"  Hermione frowned, trying understand, saw similar frowns faces Anthony Ron. If Chaos Dragon attacked straight out, spent forces fighting other, practically conceding battle Sunshine...  "Potter thinks we're allied he's attacking Malfoy now, Dragon link us," said Blaise Zabini common ranks soldiers. "Or Potter thinks beat armies row, attacks separately." The Slytherin boy gave condescending sigh. "Are going promote back officer now? You lot hopeless without me, know."  They ignored talking noises coming Zabini's mouth.  "We still moving right direction?" said Anthony.  "Yeah," said Ernie.  "We getting close them?" said Ron.  "Not yet -"  That huge black-wooden doors end corridor flew open crashed wall, revealing two figures almost completely enveloped grey cloaks, grey cloth stretched faces beneath grey hoods, one figures already raising wand pointing directly her.  And face game changed drastically, Harry's voice, high strained effort, screamed word:  "Stupefy!"  The dueling-grade stunner blasted toward her, shocked start move almost late, red jet light smashed right Contego shield front barely dodged, tingle arm red light went past her, saw corner eye Susan getting hit blown feet Ron -  "Somnium!" bellowed Anthony's voice, followed moment later dozen voices crying "Somnium!"  Hermione frantically pushed feet, rose, saw two figures grey cloaks standing there.  You see Sleep Hexes, spell weak -  But way could've missed.  "Stupefy!" shrieked voice Neville Longbottom, another red jet shot her, fell undignified heap desperately twisted way, scrambled up, panting, saw time stunbolt gotten Ron he'd rising ground.  "Hello there, Sunshine," said Harry's voice beneath hood.  "We're Grey Knights Chaos," said Neville's voice.  "We'll opponents battle," said Harry's voice, "while Chaos's army slaughters Dragons."  "And way," said Neville's voice, "we're invincible."   The two boys grey cloaks robes, grey cloth faces, stood facing Sunshine's entire army, seemingly unfazed dozen Sleep Hexes.  Daphne heard soft sigh beside her, head turned saw Hannah's lips parted, Hufflepuff girl's eyes huge, staring -  It would hard describe jumble thoughts flashed Daphne's mind realized Hannah staring Neville rather Harry, turn seemed trigger part noticing point fact Neville getting pretty interesting lately boys went, fact right Last Scion Longbottom seeming downright cool, something woke inside lips parted everything Lady Mother ever instructed demure demeanors flattery scented shampoo blew straight mind hard fluffed hair ears, she'd watched Hermione Harry knew wanted courtship go -  Her Lady Mother also recently instructed spells might embarrassing know belonged Noble Most Ancient House Greengrass.  Daphne's wand swung point left, shouted "Tonare!"  The wand went head, spoke incantation "Ravum Calvaria!"  And finally grasped wand hands shrieked, "Lucis Gladius!"  The huge magical drain almost sent knees, bore it, blazing shape fully formed stabilized drain little less.  Still, feeling she'd better try fight long.  That everyone staring went quite without saying, leaped forward confront Neville hair billowing around her, could walk forward steadily level Most Ancient Blade Neville Longbottom. That everyone moved aside made way also went without saying.  "I hight Daphne, Noble Most Ancient House Greengrass!" cried. "Greengrass Sunshine!" The dueling forms gone completely mind, she'd seen enough plays remember death challenges blood challenges remember appropriate this, pointed incandescent sword toward object crush yelled, "Let's see got, Nevvy!"  Once Harry's voice shrieked "Stupefy!", later on, remembering this, could never quite believe she'd managed it, slashed blade light like Beater's bat, hit stunbolt back Harry barely managed twist way.  "Tonare!" shouted Neville, Noble Most Ancient House Longbottom. "Ravum Calvaria, Lucis Gladius!"   For seconds, one anything stare Neville Daphne started whacking other. They moving slowly, Hermione guessed spell taking lot strength them. It impressive comparison, Muggleborn watched certain movies.  But still give extra credit using lightsabers all.  "Point order," said Harry's voice. "I know Defense Professor watching, I still ask, anyone know whether they'll slice half actually hit -"  "No," Hermione said absently. This one history books, though she'd idea magical dueling sword looked like that. "They cast it'll stun touches."  "You know spell?"  "Oh, no, Charm Most Ancient Blade, legal Noble Most Ancient Houses use -"  Hermione stopped talking looked Harry, Harry's grey hood rather.  "Well," said Harry's voice, "I guess I could take rest Sunshine Regiment myself, then." She see face, voice sounded like smiling.  "You dodged Daphne hit spell back you," Hermione said. "So whatever did, invincible. A Stupefy still get you."  "Interesting theory," said Harry's voice beneath hood. "Got anyone army test it?"  "I read Stunning Hex once," said Hermione. "A months ago. I wonder I remember instructions right?" Her wand came point Harry.  There slight pause, nearby boy girl breathing audible gasps slowly whacked lightsabers.  "Of course," Harry said, leveling wand her, "I use Somnium you. That'll take lot less effort."  New Contego shields sprung existence front her, cast Jenny Parvati, even Harry spoke.  The tip Hermione's wand began making small motions air, diamond within circle, diamond within circle, rehearsing gesture match exactly remembered seeing book. It would difficult feat even her, cast spell right first try, afford failed castings would sap energy.  "You know," said Hermione Granger, "I understand really fault, I'm getting tired hearing people talk Boy-Who-Lived like - like kind god something."  "Same here, I must say," said Harry Potter. "It's sad people keep underestimating me."  Her wand kept rehearsing diamond within circle, over. Harry would recharging strength, knew, even practiced much could attack. "I'm starting think need taking peg, General Chaos."  "You could right," Harry said equably. His feet began shuffle recognized duelist's dance. "Unfortunately there's nothing left defeat except another Harry Potter."  "Let specific, Mr. Potter. I'm taking peg."  "You army?"  "You think pretty cool, you," said Hermione.  "Why, yes," said Harry. "Yes, I do. Some might call arrogant, I supposed last person Hogwarts notice awesome I am?"  Hermione raised left hand air, made fist.  It signal. Eight designated soldiers army would pointing wands her, quietly casting Wingardium Leviosa.  They'd practiced this, too, Hermione given lecturing soldiers, Anthony's suggestion, tried giving Sunshine General looked like could defeat invincible enemies.  "You pretend Superman," said Hermione. She raised left fist higher air, eight soldiers supporting Hovered ground. "Well here's Super Hermione!" Her hand pushed forward, shot rapidly air toward Harry, regretting see look face, wand made diamond within circle summoned magic could, felt like imagined touching live wire would feel too-powerful spell poured voice screamed "Stupefy!"  The red bolt burst wand, perfectly formed.  Harry dodged it.  And then, practiced part inside hallways, crashed wall.   "Somnium!" shrieked Draco, seconds recharge, "SOMNIUM, CURSE YOU!"  He knew hitting Theodore, boy even trying dodge, scion Nott grinned evilly father leveled wand -  Draco managed leap aside Theodore said "Somnium!" Draco getting winded, keep up, Theodore bothering dodge Draco keep moving, crazy.  He enough strength fire again, -  Stupidity thing expecting different result, Harry said, Harry's work somehow, Muggle artifact anymore Draco figure could be, thinking hypotheses ways test busy frantically dodging Theodore laughed shot another Sleep Hex him, Draco felt little numbness side time twisted, very near miss finally Draco take anymore, bother working theory testing -  "Luminos!" shouted Draco, Theodore haloed red light, "Dulak!" went (so Theodore still affected magic), "Expelliarmus!" Theodore's wand went flying (that good spell cast anyway Draco realized it) Theodore rushing toward Draco arms outstretched grapple Draco yelled "Flipendo!" boy's feet abruptly yanked -  - Theodore's back hit ground surprisingly loud metallic-sounding crash.  Draco's vision swimming casting four spells fast succession, Theodore already scrambling feet, even time think words, Draco still managed say "Somnium!" time aimed Theodore's face instead chest.  Theodore dodged (he dodged!) boy shouted "Code seven Malfoy!"  "Prismatis!" cried Padma's voice suddenly shimmering rainbow wall front Draco, four Chaotic voices cried "Somnium!"  And pause, everyone looked huge Prismatic Sphere protecting remnants Dragon Army.  Casting fifth spell sent Draco hands knees, looked managed say, clearly could, "If Sleep Hex - work - aim face - I think Lieutenants wearing metal shirts."  "You've already lost many soldiers," Finnigan said loudly across barrier, "we'll beat anyway," Gryffindor boy laughed evilly. He evil laughter almost well Harry Potter now, Chaotic Legionnaires started laughing soon afterward.  Draco could see corner eye Gregory Vincent lay unconscious. Padma still sustaining Prismatic Sphere, largest one he'd ever seen cast; breathing hard, still visibly sweaty they'd jogged get position, Ravenclaw girl strong witch athletic one.  He really hoped General Granger got soon hit Chaos behind. General Potter Neville Chaos missing, Draco could guess they'd gone, two soldiers delay whole Sunshine Regiment long themselves, could they?   She knew fair, girl given could, Hermione still wished Daphne lasted longer.  "Lagann!" said Neville's voice behind flew, sound Prismatic Wall shattering, Hannah's voice desperately cried "Somnium!" moments later Neville's voice calmly said "Somnium" thud another soldiers falling over.  And force keeping air diminished again, Hermione could feel grab Hover Charms straining her, enough.  Her flight stopped began falling slow motion toward ground, signaled soldiers drop her, angry confused thinking fast enough still trying muster strength one last Stunning Hex, nowhere go Harry pointed wand said "Somnium" last word Hermione Granger heard battle.   Chapter 68: Self Actualization, Pt 3  Hermione feeling nice right now, Good either, hot ball anger burning inside wondered something like Harry's darkness (though probably even close) felt way silly little game -  Her whole army. Two soldiers beaten whole army. That she'd told woke up.  It little much.  "Well," Professor Quirrell said. From close Defense Professor look quite healthy last time she'd office; skin looked paler, moved little slower. His expression stern ever, gaze penetrating; fingers tapped sharply desk, rap-rap. "I would guess three you, Mr. Malfoy guessed I've asked here."  "Something Noble Most Ancient Houses?" said Harry beside her, sounding puzzled. "I violate kind crazy law firing Daphne, I?"  "Not quite," man said heavy irony. "Since Miss Greengrass invoke correct dueling forms, entitled demand stripped House name. Although course I would permitted formal duel. Wars respect rules." The Defense Professor leaned forward rested chin steepled hands, though sitting upright already tired him. His eyes gazed them, sharp dangerous. "General Malfoy. Why I call here?"  "General Potter two us fair fight anymore," Draco Malfoy said quiet voice.  "What?" blurted Hermione. "We almost them, Daphne fainted -"  "Miss Greengrass faint magical exhaustion," Professor Quirrell said dryly. "Mr. Potter shot back Sleep Hex soldiers distracted sight general flying wall. But congratulations nonetheless, Miss Granger, almost defeating two Chaotic Legionnaires mere twenty-four Sunshine Soldiers."  The blood flaming cheeks grew little hotter. "That - - I'd figured wearing armor -"  Professor Quirrell gazed touched fingers. "Of course ways could won, Miss Granger. There always are, every lost battle. The world around us redunds opportunities, explodes opportunities, nearly folk ignore would require violate habit thought; every battle thousand Hufflepuff bones waiting sharpened spears. If thought try massed Finite Incantatem general principles, would dispelled Mr. Potter's suit chainmail everything else wearing except underwear, leads suspect Mr. Potter quite realize vulnerability. Or could soldiers swarm Mr. Potter Mr. Longbottom physically wrest wands hands. Mr. Malfoy's response I would term well-reasoned, least wholly ignore thousand alternatives." A sardonic smile. "But you, Miss Granger, misfortune remember cast Stunning Hex, search excellent memory dozen easier spells might proved efficacious. And pinned army's hopes person, lost spirit fell. Afterward continued cast futile Sleep Hexes, governed habits fighting trained them, unable break pattern Mr. Malfoy did. I cannot quite comprehend goes people's minds repeat failed strategy over, apparently astonishingly rare realization try something else. And Sunshine Regiment wiped two soldiers." The Defense Professor grinned mirthlessly. "One perceives certain similarities fifty Death Eaters dominated magical Britain, much-loved Ministry continues rule."  The Defense Professor sighed. "Nonetheless, Miss Granger, fact remains first defeat you. In previous battle, Mr. Malfoy united forces, yet fought standstill, Mr. Malfoy pursue Mr. Potter onto roof. The Chaos Legion demonstrated, twice succession, military strength equal armies combined. This leaves choice. General Potter, select eight soldiers army, including least one Chaotic Lieutenant, divided among Dragon Army Sunshine Regiment -"  "What?" Hermione burst again, glanced generals saw Harry looked shocked her, Draco Malfoy looked resigned.  "General Potter stronger together," Professor Quirrell said calm precision. "Your contest over, won, time rebalance three armies present renewed challenge."  "Professor Quirrell!" said Harry. "I -"  "This decision Professor Battle Magic Hogwarts School Witchcraft Wizardry subject negotiation." The words still precise, look Professor Quirrell's eyes chilled Hermione's blood, even though glaring Harry her. "And I find suspicious, Mr. Potter, moment wished isolate Miss Granger Mr. Malfoy force chase onto roof, able annihilate exactly much united force pleased. Indeed, level performance I expected since start year, I annoyed discover holding back classes entire time! I seen truly do, Mr. Potter. You far beyond point Mr. Malfoy Miss Granger fight equal level, permitted pretend otherwise. This, Mr. Potter, I tell capacity professor: For learn full potential, must exercise full abilities hold back reason - particularly childish frets friends might think!"   She left Defense Professor's office larger army, less dignity, feeling lot like sad little bug squished, trying very hard cry.  "I holding back!" Harry said soon turned first corner away Professor Quirrell's office, moment wooden door faded sight behind stone walls. "I pretending, I never let either win!"  She answer, answer, would break loose tried say word.  "Really?" said Draco Malfoy. The Dragon General still air resignation. "Because Quirrell's right, know, suspicious could beat nearly everyone armies soon wanted make us chase onto roof. And say something then, Potter, us needing beat fighting real?"  The burning sensation creeping throat, reached eyes would burst tears, would crying little girl them.  "That -" Harry's voice said urgently, looking voice sounded like head turned toward her. "That - I tried lot harder time, important reason, I to, I used whole bunch tricks I'd saving - -"  She'd always trying hardest, every time.  "- I, I let side I usually use something like Defense class -"  So ever got close winning Harry really mattered, could go dark side crush her, it?  ...of course was. She even look Harry eyes scary, ever thought could beat real?  The corridor forked, Harry Potter Draco Malfoy went left toward staircase climbed second floor, went right instead, even know passage went right she'd rather lost castle.  "Excuse me, Draco," said Harry's voice, pattering footsteps behind her.  "Leave alone," said, came sounding stern shut mouth press lips together tightly hold breath stop coming out.  That boy kept coming, ran around put front her, stupid why, Harry said, voice high desperate whisper, "I run away beating classes except broomstick riding!"  He understand, would never understand, Harry Potter would never understand, matter contest lost would still Boy-Who-Lived, Harry Potter Hermione Granger beating meant everyone expecting rise challenge, Hermione Granger Harry Potter beating meant one.  "It's fair," said, voice shaking crying yet, yet, "I fight dark side, I'm - I'm -" I'm twelve, thought then.  "I used dark side - I to!"  "So today beat whole army Harry?" She still crying yet, wondered face looked like right now, looked like angry Hermione sad one.  "I -" Harry said. His voice got little lower, "I wasn't... really expecting win, time, I know I said I invincible try scare you, I really thought we'd slow bit -"  She started walking again, walked right past him, passed Harry's face tightened like going cry.  "Is Professor Quirrell right?" came high desperate whisper behind her. "If I friend, I always afraid better I know hurt feelings? That's fair, Hermione!"  She took breath held ran, feet pattering across stone fast could, running fast dared vision blurry, ran one would hear her, time Harry follow.   Minerva going Transfiguration parchment due Monday, marked negative two hundred points fifth-year parchment error could potentially killed someone. During first year professor she'd indignant folly older students, resigned. Some people never learned, never noticed hopeless, stayed bright eager kept trying. Sometimes believed told them, left Hogwarts, must never try anything unusual, give free Transfiguration use art established Charms; sometimes... didn't.  She middle trying unravel particularly convoluted answer knock door disrupted thoughts; office hours, taken short time Head Gryffindor House learn suspend judgment. You could always deduct House points afterward.  "Come in," said crisp voice.  The young girl entered office clearly crying, afterward washed face hopes show -  "Miss Granger!" said Professor McGonagall. It taken moment recognize face eyes reddened cheeks puffed. "What happened?"  "Professor," said young girl wavering voice, "you said I ever worried uncomfortable anything, I come -"  "Yes," said Professor McGonagall, "now happened?"  The girl started explain -   Hermione stood still stairs turned around her, revolving helix taken anywhere all, instead bore continuously upward. Hermione thought seemed like Enchantment Endless Stair, invented 1733 wizard Arram Sabeti who'd lived top Mount Everest days Muggles could climb it. Only right Hogwarts much older - maybe enchantment reinvented?  She frightened, nervous second meeting Headmaster.  She was, fact, frightened nervous second meeting Headmaster.  Only Hermione Granger thinking; she'd thinking lot, able run slid wall lungs fire, thinking curled ball back chilly stone wall legs drawn crying.  Even lost Harry Potter never, ever going lose Draco Malfoy, totally absolutely unacceptable, Professor Quirrell praised General Malfoy ignoring thousand alternatives; Hermione cried she'd thought fourteen spells tried Harry Neville, she'd started wondering might making sort mistake things; she'd ended knocking Professor McGonagall's door. Not asking help, right Hermione plans could ask help with, telling Professor McGonagall everything, she'd thought seemed like one thousand alternatives Professor Quirrell talking about.  And she'd told Professor McGonagall Harry Potter changed since day phoenix shoulder, people more seemed see something Harry's, seemed like Harry pulling farther farther away everyone else school year went around sad air sometimes like losing something, know anymore.  And Professor McGonagall told needed talk Headmaster.  And Hermione felt worried, thought come Harry Potter scared Headmaster. Harry Potter would barged ahead whatever trying do. Maybe (the thought come her) worth trying like that, scared, whatever, seeing happened her, really worse.  The Endless Stair stopped turning.  The great oaken door front brass griffin knocker opened without touched.  Behind black oaken desk dozens drawers facing every direction, looking like drawers set inside drawers, silver-bearded Headmaster Hogwarts upon throne, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, whose gently twinkling eyes Hermione looked around three seconds distracted things room.  Some time later - sure long trying count number things room third time still getting answer, even though memory insisted nothing added removed - Headmaster cleared throat said, "Miss Granger?"  Hermione's head snapped around, felt little heat cheeks; Dumbledore appear annoyed all, serene, inquiring look mild, half-glassed eyes.  "Hermione," said Professor McGonagall, older witch's voice gentle hand rested reassuringly Hermione's shoulder, "please tell Headmaster said Harry."  Hermione began speaking, despite newfound resolution voice still stumbled little nervousness, described Harry changed last weeks since Fawkes shoulder.  When done pause, Headmaster sighed. "I sorry, Hermione Granger," said Dumbledore. Those blue eyes grown sadder spoke. "That is... unfortunate, I cannot say unexpected. That hero's burden, see."  "A hero?" said Hermione. She looked nervously Professor McGonagall saw Transfiguration Professor's face grown tight, though hand still squeezed Hermione's shoulder reassuringly.  "Yes," said Dumbledore. "I hero once, I mysterious old wizard, days I opposed Grindelwald. You read history books, Miss Granger?"  Hermione nodded.  "Well," said Dumbledore, "that heroes do, Miss Granger, tasks must grow strong accomplish them, see happening Harry. If anything done gentle pathway, one it, I. For I Harry's friend, alas, mysterious old wizard."  "I -" said Hermione. "I'm sure - I still want -" Her voice stopped, seemed awful say aloud.  Dumbledore closed eyes, opened them, looked little older before. "No one stop you, Miss Granger, choose stop Harry's friend. As would him, may know better I."  "That - seem fair," Hermione said, voice trembling. "That I've got Harry's friend he's got one else? That seem fair."  "Being friend something forced to, Miss Granger." The blue eyes seemed look right her. "The feelings there, not. If there, accept deny them. You Harry's friend - choosing deny would wound terribly, perhaps beyond healing. But Miss Granger, would drive extremes?"  She find words. She'd never able find words. "If get near Harry - get swallowed up, one sees more, something his, everyone thinks whole world revolves around and..." She words.  The old wizard nodded slowly. "It indeed unjust world live in, Miss Granger. All world knows I defeated Grindelwald, fewer remember Elizabeth Beckett died opening way I could pass through. And yet remembered. Harry Potter hero play, Miss Granger; world revolve around him. He destined great things; I ween time name Albus Dumbledore remembered Harry Potter's mysterious old wizard, anything else I done. And perhaps name Hermione Granger remembered companion, prove worthy day. For I tell true: never find glory own, Harry Potter's company."  Hermione shook head rapidly. "But that's -" She'd known able explain. "It's glory, - something belongs someone else!"  "So think would rather hero?" The old wizard sighed. "Miss Granger, I hero, leader; I would thousand times happier I could belonged someone like Harry Potter. Someone made sterner stuff I, make hard decisions, yet worthy lead me. I thought, once, I knew man, I mistaken... Miss Granger, idea fortunate like you, compared heroes."  The hot burning feeling creeping throat again, along helplessness, understand Professor McGonagall brought Headmaster going help, glance Professor McGonagall's face, looked like Professor McGonagall also sure good idea.  "I want hero," said Hermione Granger, "I want hero's companion, I want me."  (The thought came seconds later maybe fact want hero, decided change she'd said.)  "Ah," said old wizard. "That tall order, Miss Granger." Dumbledore rose throne, stepped behind desk, pointed symbol wall, ubiquitous Hermione's eyes glossed right it; faded shield inscribed heraldry Hogwarts, lion snake, badger raven, Latin engraved words whose point she'd never understood. Then, realized shield was, old looked, suddenly occurred Hermione might original -  "A Hufflepuff would say," said Dumbledore, tapping finger faded badger making Hermione wince sacrilege (if original), "that people fail become meant be, lazy put work involved. A Ravenclaw," tapping raven, "would repeat words wise know far older Socrates, know thyself, say people fail become meant be, ignorance lack thought. And Salazar Slytherin," Dumbledore frowned finger tapped faded snake, "why, said become meant following desires wherever lead. Perhaps would say people fail become refuse necessary achieve ambitions. But one notes nearly Dark Wizards come Hogwarts Slytherins. Did become meant be? I think not." Dumbledore's finger tapped lion, turned toward her. "Tell me, Miss Granger, would Gryffindor say? I need ask whether Sorting Hat offered House."  It seem like hard question. "A Gryffindor would say people become be, they're afraid."  "Most people afraid, Miss Granger," said old wizard. "They live whole lives circumscribed crippling fear cuts everything might accomplish, everything might become. Fear saying wrong thing, fear losing mere possessions, fear death, fear people think them. Such fear terrible thing, Miss Granger, terribly important know that. But Godric Gryffindor would said. People become meant be, Miss Granger, right." The old wizard's voice gentle. "So tell me, Miss Granger, seems like right choice? For truly are, wherever path leads, meant become."  There long space filled sounds things could counted.  She thought it, Ravenclaw.  "I think right," Hermione said slowly, "for someone to live inside someone else's shadow like that..."  "Many things world right," said old wizard, "the question is right them. Hermione Granger, I shall less subtle usual mysterious old wizard, tell outright cannot imagine badly things could go events surrounding Harry Potter turn ill. His quest matter would even dream walking away from, knew."  "What quest?" said Hermione. Her voice trembling, clear answer Headmaster looking want give it. "What happened Harry back then, Fawkes shoulder?"  "He grew up," said old wizard. His eyes blinked several times, beneath half-moon glasses, face suddenly looked lined. "You see, Miss Granger, people grow time, people grow placed grownup situations. That happened Harry Potter Saturday. He told - share information anyone, understand - told would fight someone. I cannot tell who. I cannot tell why. But happened him, needs friends."  There pause.  "Bellatrix Black?" Hermione said. She shocked someone plugged electrical cord ear. "You're going make Harry fight Bellatrix Black?"  "No," said old wizard. "Not her. I cannot tell who, why."  She thought more.  "Is way I keep Harry?" said Hermione. "I mean, I'm saying I'll do, - needs friends equal friends? Can I hero too?"  "Ah," said old wizard, smiled. "Only decide that, Miss Granger."  "But going help like helping Harry."  The old wizard shook head. "I helped little enough, Miss Granger. And asking quest -" The old wizard smiled again, rather wryly. "Miss Granger, first year Hogwarts. Do eager grow up; time enough later."  "I'm twelve. Harry's eleven."  "Harry Potter special," said old wizard. "As know, Miss Granger." The blue eyes suddenly piercing beneath half-moon glasses, reminded day Dementor Dumbledore's voice said, inside mind, knew Harry's dark side.  Hermione put hand touched Professor McGonagall's hand, stayed strong shoulder whole time, Hermione said, surprised voice break, "I'd like go, now, please."  "Of course," said Professor McGonagall, Hermione felt hand shoulder gently turning around face oaken door.  "Have chosen path yet, Hermione Granger?" said Albus Dumbledore's voice behind her, even door slowly creaked open reveal Enchantment Endless Stair.  She nodded.  "And?"  "I'll," said, voice stuck, "I'll, I'll -"  She swallowed.  "I'll - what's right -"  She say anything else, couldn't, Endless Stair began revolving around again.  Neither Professor McGonagall spoke way down.  When Flowing Stone gargoyles stepped way, two stepped corridors Hogwarts, Professor McGonagall finally spoke, said whisper, "I'm terribly sorry, Miss Granger. I think Headmaster would say things you. I think truly forgotten like child."  Hermione glanced back saw Professor McGonagall looked like burst tears... really, tightness face like that.  "If I want hero too," said Hermione, "if I've decided hero too, anything help?"  Professor McGonagall rapidly shook head, said, "Miss Granger, I'm sure Headmaster wrong that. You twelve."  "Okay," said Hermione.  They walked forward bit.  "Excuse me," said Hermione, "is okay I walk back Ravenclaw tower myself? I'm sorry, fault anything, I want right now."  "Of course, Miss Granger," said Professor McGonagall, voice sounding little hoarse, Hermione heard footsteps stop, turn around behind her.  Hermione Granger walked away.  She climbed flight stairs, another, wondering anyone else Hogwarts would give chance hero. Professor Flitwick would say thing Professor McGonagall, even didn't, probably help, Hermione know could help. Well, Professor Quirrell would come something clever used enough Quirrell points, feeling asking would bad idea - Defense Professor help anyone become sort hero worth becoming, even understand difference.  She almost gotten Ravenclaw tower saw flash gold.   Chapter 69: Self Actualization, Pt 4  It corner eye Hermione Granger saw it, reflection polished metal statue junction two corridors, flash gold, flash red, something like image fire; moment saw it, gone.  She paused, puzzled, almost walked away, something familiar brief glow -  Hermione walked forward statue stood, looked corridor thought fiery reflection might come.  Faintly, though faraway place, heard cry, call.  Hermione started run.  She ran while; whenever got junction would pause, catch much breath could, would see flash fire reflected one direction another, hear distant call. If army training would've fallen exhaustion, running like that.  She never saw phoenix.  And came four-way branch nothing, sign, waited long seconds heard cry saw fire, starting wonder sick sad feeling she'd imagined whole thing, heard person cry out.  When rapidly racing feet turned corner mind took whole scene glance, three huge boys green-trimmed robes already turning look her, one shorter smaller boy yellow, dangling air one foot held high invisible hand.  The Sunshine General even think it, people stopped think spring good ambushes.  Her wand hand, fingers twist lips said "Somnium!" largest bully fell over, Hufflepuff boy dropped air thump two bullies trying aim wands said "Somnium!" another huge boy keeled - one who'd aiming wand faster, she'd fired at.  Unfortunately casting two Sleep Hexes row like hard even her, get third -  The last bully shouted "Protego!" surrounded shimmering blue glow.  Twenty-four hours ago, Hermione would panicked that, real Shielding Charm would let bully-boy cast spells even protected.  Now -  "Stupefy!" shouted bully-boy.  The crimson bolt blasted toward terrible brilliance, blazing far brighter hex sprung Harry's wand.  Hermione swayed slightly left, bolt missed, bully's aim nearly good Harry's; thought came maybe bullies Professor Quirrell's armies mix.  "Stupefy!" shouted bully-boy again. "Expelliarmus! Stupefy!"  Anyway, she'd spent whole hour thinking spells could've cast Harry Neville -  "Jellyfy!" yelled bully-boy, wide-beam jinx visible bolt dodge, knees suddenly felt almost weak support her. And then, angry roar producing even brighter blaze crimson, "Stupefy!"  She dodged one deliberately falling, she'd recovered enough next spell, -  "Glisseo," said Hermione, directing remark floor.  "Oof," said bully-boy feet went actually dropped wand.  The Protego winked out.  "Somnium," said Hermione.  She still breathing gasps crawled Hufflepuff boy sitting up, groaning rubbing skull he'd dropped head-first floor; good thing Muggle, Hermione realized, might snapped neck. She actually thought that.  "Uh," said boy, hair color would've called 'brunette' girl, eyes undistinguished brown somehow seemed right Hufflepuff, tears face looked sort pale. She pegged fourth year, third.  Then brown eyes widened focused her. "General Sunshine?"  "Yeah," said. "That's (gasp) me." If Hufflepuff boy said anything Harry Potter's love interest, decided, going die.  "Wow," said Hufflepuff boy. "That - - I mean I saw screens Christmas - wow! I can't believe that!"  There pause.  I can't believe I that, thought Hermione Granger, feeling little faint sudden, must running. "Excuse (gasp) me," said, "can (gasp) Unjellyfy legs?"  The boy nodded, pushed feet, reached inside robes wand; Hermione correct gesture counter-Jinx worked right.  "I'm Michael Hopkins," said boy Hermione rolled back feet. He stuck hand. "Or Mike inside Hufflepuff, Mikes Hufflepuff year, would believe it?"  They shook hands, Mike said, "Anyway, thank you."  Hermione prepared rush euphoria hit then, saving someone like literally felt better anything she'd ever felt whole life.  She turned look bullies.  They big looked, thought, around fifteen years old, suddenly realizing large difference sprung Hogwarts students who'd signed Professor Quirrell's extra-curricular activities, students who'd years taught worst Professors ever go Professing. Being able hit things aimed at, example; able think well enough middle fight realize ought Innervate fallen allies. And things Professor Quirrell said, like real world almost fight would settled surprise attack, suddenly made lot sense her.  Still trying catch breath, looked back Mike.  "Would (gasp) believe," said Hermione Granger, "that five minutes ago I (gasp) trouble figuring become (gasp) hero?"  Had really thought needed permission someone, heroes sat around waiting someone else give quests? It simple actually, went evil was, ever took hero. She remembered, needed phoenix tell her, bad things sometimes happened right Hogwarts.  Then Hermione glanced nervously back three older boys lying unconscious realization hit they'd seen her, might know was, might sneak take surprise - could really hurt -  Hermione stopped.  She remembered Harry Potter put middle five Slytherin bullies first day class even known use wand.  She remembered Headmaster saying grew put grownup situations, people lived lives inside constraining circle fear.  And remembered Professor McGonagall's voice saying, 'You twelve.'  Hermione took deep breath, once, twice, three times.  She asked Mike needed go Madam Pomfrey's office, didn't; got tell names Slytherin boys, case.  And Hermione Granger strolled away heap unconscious bullies, making sure put smile face walked.  She knew probably going get hurt sooner later. But scared getting hurt right, hero, simple that; put Sorting Hat head moment waited even onesecond calling 'GRYFFINDOR!'   She still thinking came dinner; euphoria saving someone still worn off, beginning worry broken something brain.  As approached Ravenclaw table sudden epidemic whispers broke out, Hermione wondered Hufflepuff boy said anything yet realized whispers probably that.  She sat across Harry Potter looked extremely nervous, probably still smiling.  "Uh -" said Harry, served freshly toasted bread, butter, cinnamon, fruits vegetables whatsoever, three helpings chocolate brownies. "Uh -"  She let go like she'd finished pouring glass grapefruit juice, said, "I've got question you, Mr. Potter. How think people fail become themselves?"  "What?" said Harry.  She looked him. "Pretend stuff going on," said, "and say whatever said yesterday."  "Um..." Harry said, looking confused worried. "I think already ourselves... like I'm imperfect copy someone else. But I guess I try run sense question, I'd say people become absorb crazy stuff environment regurgitate it. I mean, many people playing Quidditch would playing game like they'd invented game themselves? Or back Muggle Britain, many people think Labour Conservative Liberal Democrat would invent exact bundle political beliefs come everything themselves?"  Hermione considered this. She'd wondering Harry would say something Slytherin maybe even Gryffindor, seem fit Headmaster's list; occurred Hermione might lot viewpoints subject four.  "Okay," said Hermione, "different question. What makes someone hero?"  "A hero?" said Harry.  "Yeah," said Hermione.  "Ah..." Harry said. His fork knife nervously sawed piece steak, cutting tinier tinier pieces. "I think lot people things world channels it... like people expecting it, uses skills already know, there's authority watching catch mistakes make sure part. But problems like probably already solved, know, there's need heroes. So I think people call 'heroes' rare they've got make everything go along, people comfortable that. Why ask?" Harry's fork stabbed three pieces thoroughly shredded steak lifted mouth.  "Oh, I stunned three older Slytherin bullies rescued Hufflepuff," said Hermione. "I'm going hero."  When Harry finished choking food (some Ravenclaws hearing distance still coughing) said, "What?"  Hermione told story, began rippling whispers even spoke. (Though left part phoenix, seemed like private thing two them. Hermione felt surprised, thinking afterward, phoenix would appear someone wanted hero; seemed bit selfish thought way; maybe matter phoenixes long saw willing help people.)  When done talking, Harry stared across table say word.  "I'm sorry I acted earlier," Hermione said. She sipped glass grapefruit juice. "I remembered I'm still beating pants Charms class okay better Defense."  "Please take wrong way," said Harry. He looked too-adult now, grim. "But sure are, not, put bluntly, me?"  "I'm quite certain," said Hermione. "Why, name practically spells 'heroine' except extra 'm', I never noticed today."  "Being hero fun games," said Harry. "Not real heroing, sort grownups do, like this, going easy."  "I know," said Hermione.  "It's hard painful got make decisions good answer -"  "Yes, Harry, I read books too."  "No," said Harry, "you understand, even books warn there's way understand -"  "That stop you," said Hermione. "It stop even little. I bet never even considered hero that. So d'you think it'll stop me?"  There pause.  A sudden huge smile lit Harry's face, smile bright boyish frown grim adult, everything right them.  "This going go horribly mind-bogglingly wrong somehow," said Harry, still smiling hugely. "You know that, right?"  "Oh, I know," said Hermione. She ate another bite toast. "That reminds me, Dumbledore refused mysterious old wizard, someplace I write get another one?"   Aftermath:  "...and Professor Flitwick says determination seems unshakeable," Minerva said tightly, staring silver-bearded old wizard responsible this. Albus Dumbledore sitting silently listening distant sad look eyes. "Miss Granger even blink Professor Flitwick threatened transferred Gryffindor, said left would take books her. Hermione Granger decided going hero taking answer. I doubt could pushed harder tried -"  It took five full seconds Minerva's brain process realization.  "ALBUS!" shrieked.  "My dear," said old wizard, "after dealt thirtieth hero so, realize react quite predictably certain things; told young, destined heroes, hero unpleasant; truly wish sure tell three. Although," brief sigh, "it blatant, Deputy Headmistress might catch you."  "Albus," Minerva said, voice even tighter, "if hurt, I swear time I'll -"  "She would come place due time," Albus said, distant sad look still eyes. "If someone meant become hero listen warnings, Minerva, matter hard try. And given that, better Harry Miss Granger fall far behind him." Albus produced, though nowhere, tin flipped open reveal small yellow lumps, she'd never able figure kept she'd never able detect magic involved. "Lemon drop?"  "She twelve-year-old girl, Albus!"   Afteraftermath:  Within windows, barely visible evening gloom, fishes swam black waters; illuminated bright shine Slytherin common room came closer, fading darkness swam away.  Daphne Greengrass sitting comfortable black leather couch, head collapsed hands, glowing golden-yellowish bright sparks white light winked existence around her.  She'd ready teased liking Neville Longbottom. She'd expecting hear lot snide remarks Hufflepuffs. She'd thought whole reams snappy comebacks way back Slytherin dungeons.  She'd looking forward teased liking Neville. Being teased sort thing meant grown real girl.  As turned out, nobody worked challenging Neville Most Ancient Duel meant liked him. She'd thought would obvious no, nobody else even thought apparently.  It always hex see hit you.  She called Daphne Sunshine, like Neville Chaos. Or Sunny Daphne like Sunny Ron. Or anything except Greengrass Sunshine.  Greengrass Sunshine.  It gone Greengrass Sunshine Blue Skies.  Then someone added Snow-Topped Mountains Frolicking Woodland Creatures.  Currently referred Sparkly Unicorn Princess Noble Most Ancient House Sparklypoo.  And cursed sixth-year girl hit Sparkling Jinx, even known thing Sparkling Jinx, Finite Incantatem worked, she'd asked older girls she'd thought friends (she apparently wrong this) she'd threatened caster grievous political mayhem wreaked father nonetheless Daphne Greengrass still sitting Slytherin common room head hands, sparkling brightly wondering she'd ended sane person Hogwarts.  It dinnertime still stop tomorrow morning going transfer Durmstrang become next Dark Lady.  "Hey, everyone!" said Carrow twins dramatically, waving issue Daily Prophet. "Did hear news? The Wizengamot ruled 'let's see got' constitutes lawful challenge fought challenger lies nap!"  "How dare insult honor Sparkly Unicorn Princess!" shouted Tracey. "Let's see got!" Then Tracey lay flat sofa started snoring loudly.  Daphne's sparkling head sank glowing hands. "After family takes I'm going put anti-Apparition jinxes Flooed sea," said one particular. "You're okay that, right?"  Thunk-thunk, thunk-thunk-thunk, thunk.  Daphne looked up, surprised; Sunshine code-signal -  "I hight someone knocking!" bellowed Mr. Goyle. "Knocking door!"  "Let's see got, door!" shouted older boy near door, yanked door open.  There moment complete surprise.  "I've come word Miss Greengrass," said Sunshine General, sounding like trying sound confident. "Could someone please -"  From look Hermione's face noticed Daphne sparkling.  And Millicent Bulstrode raced lower dorms shouted, "Hey, everyone, guess what, Granger went beat Derrick what's left crew, father owled said -"  Millicent caught sight Hermione standing doorway.  There loud silence.  "Uh," said Daphne. What? said brain. "Uh, what're here, General?"  "Well," said Hermione Granger strange smile face, "I've decided fair mysterious old wizards give people chance heroes others, also I've read history books nearly enough girl heroes them. So I thought I'd drop see wanted hero glowing like that?"  There another silence.  "This," said Daphne, "was probably best time ask question -"  "I'll take it!" shouted Tracey Davis, leaping sofa.   And thus born Society Promotion Heroic Equality Witches.   Chapter 70: Self Actualization, Pt 5  Even Deputy Headmistress three decades, Transfiguration Professor that, rare saw Albus Dumbledore caught completely flatfooted.  "...Susan Bones, Lavender Brown, Daphne Greengrass," Minerva finished. "I also note, Albus, Miss Granger's account seemingly unsupportive attitude - I believe phrase 'he said I happy sidekick' - generated good deal interest among older girls. Several came to ask Miss Granger's accusations true, since Miss Granger said I there."  The old wizard leaned back huge chair, still gazing her, eyes looking rather abstracted beneath half-moon glasses.  "It placed something dilemma, Albus," said Professor McGonagall. Her face stayed quite neutral, made sure that. "I know truly mean discourage girl. Quite opposite, fact. But Severus often told keep secret I must give sign differs reaction someone truly ignorant. Thus I choice confirm Miss Granger's account accurate, feign appropriate degree worry, slight overtone offense. After all, I known deliberately manipulating Miss Granger, I might rather put out."  "I... see," old wizard said slowly. His hands toyed absently silver beard, small quick gestures.  "Thankfully," Professor McGonagall continued, "so far Professors Sinistra Vector two faculty members Miss Granger's buttons."  "Buttons?" repeated old wizard.  Minerva drew forth small silver disc bearing initials S.P.H.E.W., laid Albus's desk, gave brief tap finger.  And voices Hermione Granger, Padma Patil, Parvati Patil, Lavender Brown, Susan Bones, Hannah Abbott, Daphne Greengrass, Tracey Davis cried unison, "We settle second best, time give witch quest!"  "Miss Granger selling two Sickles, tells far sold fifty them. I believe Nymphadora Tonks, seventh-year Hufflepuff, enchanting her. To conclude report," Professor McGonagall said briskly, "our eight newly minted heroines asked permission conduct protest outside entrance office."  "I hope," Albus said, frowning, "you explained -"  "I explained Wednesday 7PM would fine," said Minerva. She took back button Headmaster's desk, favored Albus honeyed smile, turned door.  "Minerva?" said old wizard behind her. "Minerva!"  The oaken door shut solidly behind her.   There lot room brief stone walls demarcated vestibule Headmaster's office, although lot people wanted watch protest, many allowed come. Just Professor Sinistra Professor Vector, wearing buttons, prefects Penelope Clearwater Rose Brown Jacqueline Preece, wearing buttons. Behind them, Professor McGonagall Professor Sprout Professor Flitwick, wearing buttons, scrutinizing whole affair. Harry Potter Head Boy Hogwarts there, boy prefects Percy Weasley Oliver Beatson, wearing buttons show Solidarity. And course eight founding members S.P.H.E.W., forming picket line next gargoyles signs. Hermione's sign, attached solid wooden handle seemed weigh heavier heavier hands seconds passed, said NOBODY'S SIDEKICK.  And Professor Quirrell, leaning back far stone wall watching unreadable eyes. The Defense Professor gotten one buttons, though she'd never sold one him; wearing it, idly tossing one hand.  This whole idea seemed like much better idea four days ago, fires indignation burning fresh hot, she'd facing prospect four days later instead right now.  But carry on, heroes did, carried on, also seemed infinitely awful tell everyone calling off. Hermione wondered much heroism gone reasons like that. Most books say "And refused give up, matter sensible would been, would've embarrassing"; great deal history made lot sense way.  At 7:15pm, Professor McGonagall told her, Headmaster Dumbledore would come talk couple minutes. Professor McGonagall said frightened - Headmaster good person deep down, they'd properly gotten school's authorization protest.  But Hermione very aware even signed permission, still Defying Authority.  After she'd decided hero, Hermione done obvious thing, gone Hogwarts library taken books hero. Then she'd returned books back shelves, it'd patently obvious none authors actual heroes themselves. Instead she'd read five times over, she'd memorized every word, thirty inches Godric Gryffindor autobiography life's advice. (Or English translation, anyway; read Latin yet.) Godric Gryffindor's autobiography lot compressed books Hermione used reading, used one sentence say things taken thirty inches themselves, another sentence that...  But clear she'd read that, Defying Authority point hero, hero scared it. And Hermione Granger knew others saw her, knew people thought do.  Hermione hefted picket sign little higher concentrated breathing slowly rhythmically instead hyperventilating fell over.  "Really?" said Miss Preece tone undisguised fascination. "They vote?"  "Indeed," said Professor Sinistra. (The Astronomy Professor's hair still dark, dark face slightly lined; Hermione would guessed age around seventy, except -) "I quite remember mother's rejoicing announced Qualification Women Act, although actually qualify." (Which meant Professor Sinistra around Muggle family 1918.) "And worst it. Why, centuries earlier -"  Thirty seconds later non-Muggleborns, male female both, staring Professor Sinistra utterly shocked expressions. Hannah dropped sign.  "And worst either, half," finished Professor Sinistra. "But see sort thing could potentially lead."  "Merlin preserve us," said Penelope Clearwater strangled voice. "You mean that's men would treat us wands defend ourselves?"  "Hey!" said one boy prefects. "That's -"  There short, sardonic laugh direction Professor Quirrell. When Hermione turned head look saw Defense Professor still idly toying button, bothering glance rest them, said, "Such human nature, Miss Clearwater. Rest assured would kinder, witches wands men lacked them."  "I hardly think so!" snapped Professor Sinistra.  A cold chuckle. "I suspect happens often dare suggest, proudest pureblood families. Some lonely witch spies handsome Muggle; thinks easy would be, slip man love potion, adored alone utterly. And since knows offer resistance, why, natural take whatever pleases -"  "Professor Quirrell!" said Professor McGonagall sharply.  "I'm sorry," Professor Quirrell said mildly, eyes still looking button hand, "are still pretending happen? My apologies, then."  Professor Sinistra snapped, "And I suppose wizards -"  "There children present, Professors!" Again Professor McGonagall.  "Some do," Professor Quirrell said equably, though discussing weather. "Although personally, I don't."  There bit silence, time. Hermione put sign - slipped shoulder listening. She'd never thought that, even little, trying think it, stomach feeling bit queasy. She looked Harry Potter's direction, quite knowing did; saw Harry's face perfectly still. A chill ran spine looked away, quite fast enough miss small nod Harry gave her, though agreeing something.  "To fair," Professor Sinistra said while, "since I received Hogwarts letter I can't recall encountering prejudice account woman, colored. No, Muggleborn. I believe Miss Granger said heroes found problem, far?"  It took Hermione moment recognize she'd asked question, said "Yes," tone squeaked little. This whole thing blown bit larger she'd imagined she'd started it.  "What exactly check, Miss Granger?" said Professor Vector. She looked older Professor Sinistra, hair starting gray little; Hermione ever come close Professor Vector person Arithmancy Professor asked button.  "Um," Hermione said, voice little high, "I checked history books there's many woman Ministers Magic men. Then I looked Supreme Mugwumps wizards witches many. But look people like famous Dark Wizard hunters, people who've stopped invasions Dark creatures, people who've overthrown Dark Lords -"  "And Dark Wizards themselves, course," said Professor Quirrell. Now Defense Professor looked up. "You may add list, Miss Granger. Among suspected Death Eaters know two sorceresses, Bellatrix Black Alecto Carrow. And I daresay wizards would hard-pressed name single Dark Lady besides Baba Yaga."  Hermione stared him.  He possibly -  "Professor Quirrell," said Professor Vector, "what exactly implying?"  The Defense Professor raised button golden-lettered S.P.H.E.W. faced them, said, "Heroes," turned button show silver backside said, "Dark Wizards. They similar career paths followed similar people, one hardly ask young witches turning away one course without considering reflection."  "Oh, I see!" said Tracey Davis, speaking suddenly Hermione gave small startle. "You're joining protest worried enough girls becoming Dark Witches!" Then Tracey giggled, Hermione managed point paid million pounds sterling.  There half-smile Professor Quirrell's face replied, "Not really, Miss Davis. In truth I care sort thing slightest. But futile count witches among Ministers Magic ordinary folk leading ordinary existences, Grindelwald Dumbledore He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named men." The Defense Professor's fingers idly spun button, turning over. "Then again, folk ever anything interesting lives. What matter mostly witches mostly wizards, long among them? And I suspect among them, Miss Davis; although ambitious, ambition."  "That's true!" said Tracey indignantly. "And what's mean?"  Professor Quirrell straightened leaning wall. "You Sorted Slytherin, Miss Davis, I expect grasp opportunity advancement falls hands. But great ambition driven accomplish, make opportunities. At best grasp way upward Minister Magic, high position unimportance, never breaking bounds existence."  Then Professor Quirrell's gaze shifted away Tracey, looking her, pale blue eyes staring awful intensity - "Tell me, Miss Granger. Do ambition?"  "Professor -" squeaked high stern voice Professor Flitwick, Head House's voice cut off, side vision Hermione saw Harry laid hand Professor Flitwick's shoulder shaking head, face looking adult.  Hermione felt like deer caught headlights.  "What drove break bounds, Miss Granger?" said Defense Professor, still gazing directly her. "Why getting good marks class longer enough? Is true greatness seek? Does aspect world dissatisfy you, must remake according will? Or merely child's game you? I quite disappointed rivaling Harry Potter."  "I -" said Hermione, voice high-pitched made sort peeping sound, think else say.  "You may take moment think, like," said Professor Quirrell. "Pretend homework essay, six inches due Thursday. I hear quite eloquent them."  Everyone looking her.  "I -" said Hermione. "I agree one single thing said, anywhere."  "Well spoken," came Professor McGonagall's crisp voice.  Professor Quirrell's gaze waver. "That six inches, Miss Granger. Something drives defy Headmaster's verdict gather followers yourself. Perhaps something prefer speak aloud?"  Hermione knew correct answer impress Professor Quirrell, correct answer, said it. "I think need ambition hero," Hermione said. Her voice wavered crack. "I think what's right. And they're followers, we're friends."  Professor Quirrell leaned back wall again. The half-smile faded face. "Most folk tell right, Miss Granger. They thereby rise ordinary."  Hermione took couple deep breaths, trying brave. "It's not ordinary," said stoutly could. "But I think someone tries what's right, over again, they're lazy work takes, think they're doing, they're brave enough even they're scared -" Hermione paused instant, eyes darting Tracey Daphne, "- cleverly plan - people - I think someone like would already get enough trouble."  Some girls boys chuckled, Professor McGonagall, looked wry proud time.  "You may right that," said Defense Professor, eyes half-lidded. He tossed Hermione button, caught without thinking. "My donation cause, Miss Granger. I understand worth two Sickles."  The Defense Professor turned walked away without another word.  "I thought I going faint!" gasped Hannah footsteps faded, heard girls letting breath putting signs moment.  "I ambition!" said Tracey, seemed almost verge tears. "I'm - I'm - I'll figure tomorrow, I one, I'm sure!"  "If really can't think anything," Daphne said, giving Tracey comforting pat shoulder, "just go oldie goodie try take world."  "Hey!" said Susan sharply. "You're supposed heroes now! That means good!"  "No, right," said Lavender, "I'm pretty sure General Chaos wants take world he's sort good guy."  More conversation going behind picket line. "My goodness," said Penelope Clearwater. "I think that's overtly evil Defense Professor we've ever had."  Professor McGonagall coughed warningly, Head Boy said, "You around Professor Barney," made several people twitch.  "Professor Quirrell talks like that," said Harry Potter, though sounded less certain before. "I mean, think it, anything like Professor Snape -"  "Mr. Potter," squeaked Professor Flitwick, voice polite face stern, "why ask stay silent?"  "Professor Quirrell testing Hermione see wanted mysterious old wizard," Harry said. "Which totally would worked way, shape, form, answer herself."  Hermione blinked.  Then Hermione blinked again, realized Professor Quirrell Harry Potter's mysterious old wizard, Dumbledore all, really good sign -  A rumbling noise filled small stone vestibule, Hermione, nerves already edge, spun rapidly around, almost dropping protest sign hand darted toward wand.  The gargoyles stepping aside, Flowing Stone rumbling like rock moved like flesh. The huge ugly figures waited briefly, dead gray eyes staring silent vigil. Then great gargoyles folded wings back place stepped back former positions, Flowing Stone changing outward appearance returned flexibility motionlessness, brief gap stone Hogwarts solid more.  And all, wearing robes bright purple probably looked hideous Muggleborn, stood towering form Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, Headmaster Hogwarts, Chief Warlock Wizengamot, Supreme Mugwump International Confederation Wizards, vanquisher Dark Lord Grindelwald protector Britain, rediscoverer fabled Twelve Uses Dragon's Blood, powerful wizard alive; looking her, Hermione Jean Granger, General recently expanded Sunshine Regiment, getting best grades first year Hogwarts classes, declared heroine.  Even name shorter his.  The Headmaster smiled benevolently her, wrinkle-lined eyes twinkling cheerfully beneath half-circles glass, said, "Hello, Miss Granger."  The odd thing nearly scary talking Professor Quirrell. "Hello, Headmaster Dumbledore," Hermione said slight quaver voice.  "Miss Granger," said Dumbledore, looking serious, "I think I may bit misunderstanding. I mean imply could not, hero. I certainly mean imply witches general heroes. Only were... bit young, thinking things."  Hermione, unable help herself, glanced Professor McGonagall saw Professor McGonagall giving encouraging smile - giving two kind smile, anyway - Hermione looked back Headmaster said, small quaver voice little larger now, "Since became Headmaster forty years ago, there've eleven students graduate Hogwarts became heroes, I mean people like Lupe Cazaril on, ten boys. Cimorene Linderwall witch."  "Hm," said Headmaster. There thoughtful expression face; least seemed thinking it. "Miss Granger, I never one tallying numbers. Often much easier count understand. Many good people come Hogwarts, witches wizards both; famed heroes one kind good person, perhaps highest. You include Alice Longbottom Lily Potter reckoning... But leave aside. Tell me, Miss Granger, tally many heroes came Hogwarts forty years me? For time I recall three called heroes; among three, witches all."  "I'm trying say you!" Hermione said. "Only I think maybe lot people, like Headmasters too, maybe even whole society everything, might discouraging girls."  The old wizard sighed. His half-glasses eyes looked her, though two people present. "Miss Granger, might possible discourage witches becoming Charms Mistresses, Quidditch players, even Aurors. But heroes. If someone meant hero hero be. They walk fire swim ice. Dementors stop them, deaths friends, discouragement either."  "Well," Hermione said, paused, struggling words. "Well, I mean... that's actually true? I mean, seems want witches heroes, ought teach heroing."  "Many boys girls heroes dreams," Dumbledore said quietly. He look girls, her. "Fewer waking world. Many stood ground faced darkness comes them. Fewer come darkness force face them. It hard life, sometimes lonely, often short. I told none refuse calling, neither would I wish increase number."  Hermione hesitated; something lined face stopped her, like hint emotion displayed, years years it...  Maybe heroes, lives lonely, short.  She bring say that, though, him.  "But point moot," said old wizard. He smiled, bit ruefully thought. "Miss Granger, cannot teach heroism like would teach Charms. You cannot assign twelve inches carry hope seems lost. You cannot rehearse students stand tell Headmaster done wrong. Heroes born, taught. And whatever reason, born boys girls." The Headmaster shrugged, say helpless anything that.  "Um," Hermione said. She help it, glanced behind her.  Professor Sinistra looking bit indignant. And true everyone staring like she'd silly, way she'd started imagine listening Dumbledore.  Hermione turned back face Dumbledore again, took deep breath, said, "Well, maybe people going heroes, heroes matter what. But I see anyone could really know that, aside saying afterward. And I told I wanted hero, encouraging."  "Mr. Potter," Headmaster said mildly. His eyes leave hers. "Please tell Miss Granger impression first meeting. Would say I encouraging? Speak truth."  There pause.  "Mr. Potter?" said Professor Vector's voice behind her, sounding puzzled.  "Um," Harry's voice said back, sounding extremely reluctant. "Um... well, actually case Headmaster set fire chicken."  "He what?" Hermione blurted, several people exclaiming things around time sure anyone heard her.  Dumbledore went gazing her, looking perfectly serious.  "I know Fawkes," Harry's voice said rapidly, "so told Fawkes phoenix, pointing chicken Fawkes's stand I'd think Fawkes, set chicken fire - also gave big rock told belonged father I ought carry everywhere -"  "But that's crazy!" Susan blurted out.  There sudden hush.  The Headmaster slowly turned head stare Susan.  "I -" said Susan. "I mean - I -"  The Headmaster leaned face-to-face young girl.  "I -" said Susan.  Dumbledore put finger lips twiddled them, making bweeble-bweeble-bweeble sound.  The Headmaster straightened said, "Well, good heroines, pleasant speaking you, alas, much else remains day. Still, rest assured I inscrutable everyone, witches."  The gargoyles stepped aside, Flowing Stone rumbling like rock moved like flesh.  The huge ugly figures waited briefly dead gray eyes staring silent vigil, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, smiling benevolently he'd first emerged office, stepped back Enchantment Endless Stair.  Then great gargoyles folded wings back place stepped back former positions, one last brief "Bwa-ha-ha!" echoing gap closed.  There long silence.  "He really set chicken fire?" said Hannah.   The eight continued protesting even that, honest heart gone it.  It established, careful questions Professor Flitwick, Harry Potter smelled chicken burning. Which meant probably pebble something, Transfigured chicken enclosed Boundary Charm make sure smoke escaped air - Professor Flitwick Professor McGonagall emphatic nobody trying without supervision.  But still...  But still... what?  Hermione even know still what.  But still.  After lot glances exchanged girls none wanted first say it, Hermione declared protest over, adults boys drifted off.  "You think unfair Dumbledore, you?" said Susan heroines walked away sound eight pairs feet trodding stone paving Hogwarts's corridors. "I mean, crazy everyone witches discrimination, right?"  "I want protest Headmaster more," Hannah said weakly. The Hufflepuff girl seemed bit unsteady feet. "I care Professor McGonagall says holding us, much nerves."  Lavender snorted. "I guess slaying armies Inferi anytime soon -"  "Stop that!" Hermione said sharply. "Look, us got learn heroines, right? It's okay someone know right away."  "The Headmaster think learned," Padma said. The Ravenclaw girl's face thoughtful, steps measured strode corridor. "The Headmaster even think that's good idea."  Daphne striding back straight head held bolt upright, looking like Proper Young Lady Hogwarts robes Hermione could done best formal dress. "The Headmaster," Daphne said precise voice, shoes making hard, sharp tacking sounds stone, "thinks lot us bunch silly girls playing games, someday Hermione might make good sidekick rest us hopeless."  "Is right?" said Parvati. The Gryffindor girl's face serious, making look much like twin usually did. "I mean asked -"  "No!" spat Tracey. The Slytherin girl stalking hallway looking ready kill someone, like miniature female Snape. Of girls, Tracey one Hermione knew least. Hermione talked Lavender before, she'd never really seen Tracey except wandpoint battle, Slytherin jumped sofa volunteer. "We'll show him! We'll show all!"  "Okay," said Susan, "that definitely evil -"  "No," said Lavender, "that's Chaos Legion motto, actually. Only insane laughter."  "That's right," Tracey said, voice low grim. "This time I'm laughing." The girl went stalking corridor, like dramatic music accompanying could hear.  (Hermione starting worry exactly impressionable youths Chaos Legion learning Harry Potter.)  "But - I mean -" Parvati said. She still contemplative look face. "I mean, see Headmaster would think silly girls, right? What protesting outside Headmaster's office becoming heroines?"  "Huh," Lavender said, looking thoughtful herself. "That's true. We something heroic. I mean heroinic."  "Um -" said Hannah, much expressed Hermione's feelings subject.  "Well," said Parvati, "has everyone already Dumbledore's third-floor forbidden corridor? I mean everyone Gryffindor's -"  "Hold on!" Hermione said desperately. "I want anything dangerous!"  There pause everyone looked Hermione, realizing, much late, Dumbledore wanted anyone else hero.  "I think become heroine never anything dangerous," Lavender observed reasonably.  "Besides," said Padma, considering look face. "Everyone knows nothing really bad ever happens Hogwarts, right? To students, I mean, Defense Professors. We've got ancient wards on."  "Um -" Hannah said again.  "Yeah," said Parvati, "the worst happen we'll lose dozen House points something, there's two us House come even."  "Why, that's brilliant, Hermione!" said Daphne tone great amazement. "The way set means get away anything! And I even notice cunning plan now!"  "UM -" said Hermione, Hannah, Susan.  "Right!" said Parvati. "So time us become real heroines. We'll come darkness -"  "And make face us -" said Lavender.  "And teach afraid," Tracey Davis said grimly.   Chapter 71: Self Actualization, Pt 6  "Well," Daphne whispered, keeping voice low could, "at least I feel like sane person Hogwarts more."  "Because got rest us friends?" whispered Lavender Brown, tiptoeing along left side.  "I think that's means," General Granger murmured Lavender's left.  They crept slowly carefully corridors Hogwarts, eight keeping ears peeled slightest sound Trouble, like battle looking enemy soldiers ambush; case looking bullies Vanquish victims Rescue span end breakfast-time Lavender Parvati get Herbology class.  Lavender argued one first-year girl could take three older bullies, eight first-year girls ought able outfight twenty-four older bullies Multiplication.  Judging frantic spluttering waving hands, General Granger found convincing.  Padma stayed silent bit ensuing argument, observed thoughtfully even Hogwarts, beating first-year girls probably good reputation bully.  Parvati straightened this, exclaiming meant ones could something Hogwarts's bully problem, made really truly heroinic. Plus whole reason parents moved Britain two could attend world's magical school 0% fatality rate, point take advantage try things?  To General Granger responded Parvati understand point perfect safety record -  Lavender said really friends together Hermione's followers like Professor Quirrell thought, vote things like this.  Daphne expected would deciding vote Hermione Susan Hannah voted no. And Daphne considered carefully first flush enthusiasm wore off. She Slytherin, all, meant responsibility keep watchful eye interests running around trying help people - job figure risky really was, whether would worth them, like Mother would done place. Always looking friends like that, real Slytherining about...  Hannah Abbott, nervous little Hufflepuff girl, small trembling voice said "Yes."  And Daphne Susan Hermione stay five, possibly let others go own. Because Gryffindor would ever live hurting last surviving child Bones family, Slytherin would dare assault daughter Noble Most Ancient House Greengrass. (Daphne hoped so, anyway.) And General Granger who'd started whole thing... even ask.  The corridors Hogwarts passed one another, tense hands never straying far wands, stone wood Everburning Torches came vision moved past. At one point heard footsteps drew breath, hands almost dropping wands, lone older Ravenclaw looked curiously sniffing dropping head back book walked on.  The heroines crept past solemn oaken panels carved gilded frescos, came dead end leading boys' bathroom, turned around, wandered back solemn oaken panels carved gilded frescos, turned dusty old brick corridors grouted worn cement, sort led circle actually, consulted portrait went different dusty old brick corridor instead, took brief rise marble stairs put third-and-a-halfth floor it'd anywhere Hogwarts, back tiled stone pavement again, skylights let shafts sunlight pour even though nowhere near roof, they'd followed passageway around corners took another boys' bathroom, clearly marked plaque showing silhouette robed figure whizzing toilet.  The eight stood closed door stared certain amount weariness.  "I'm bored," said Lavender.  Padma made show taking pocketwatch robes looking it. "Sixteen minutes thirty seconds," said. "A new record longest attention span Gryffindor."  "I think going work either," said Susan. "And I'm Hufflepuff."  "Y'know," Lavender said thoughtfully, "I wonder maybe really makes someone hero, try something like this, something interesting actually happens."  "I bet right," said Tracey. "I bet Harry Potter us, we'd run three bullies hidden room full treasure first five minutes. I bet General Chaos go bathroom he, like, finds Slytherin's Chamber Secrets something -"  Daphne quite let one go past. "You think Lord Slytherin would've put entrance Chamber Secrets bathroom -"  "What I'm saying," said Susan, Tracey opening mouth reply, "is we've got way actually finding bullies. I mean, they've got find Hufflepuff somewhere, we've got run across exactly right time, d'you see? Which good problem find we'd get squished like bugs. Can't forbidden third-floor corridor like we're supposed to?"  Lavender snorted scornfully. "You become real heroine forbidden things Headmaster tells do!"  (Daphne's mind tried wrap around statement silently thanked Sorting Hat putting anywhere near Gryffindor.)  "Come think..." Parvati said slowly, "I mean, what're odds Harry Potter would run across five bullies first morning school? He must've way finding them."  Daphne happened standing looking Parvati let see Hermione, noticed Ravenclaw girl's expression change - realized Sunshine General also found bullies recently -  "Oh!" said Padma tone sudden realization. "Of course! He got told ghost Salazar Slytherin!"  "What?" said Daphne time several people.  "That's ghost scared me, I'm pretty sure," Padma explained. "I mean I figured afterward, but... yeah. Salazar Slytherin's ghost like Slytherins bully people, thinks shames name, ghost still keyed Hogwarts wards knows everything happens, I bet."  Daphne's mouth hanging open; saw Hannah put hand forehead leaning stone walls, Tracey's eyes blazing like little brown stars.  Salazar Slytherin's ghost?  Had leagued Harry Potter?  And sent Hermione Granger stop Derrick's crew?  She would paid hundred Galleons Draco Malfoy got told this.  Although considering fast rumors spread Hogwarts, Padma spilled beans, Millicent probably told thirty minutes ago...  In fact... Daphne thought it...  "So," said Parvati. "We've got ask Boy-Who-Lived find Salazar Slytherin's ghost? Wow, I guess I'm saying stuff like loud, I might actually turning heroine -"  "Yes!" said Lavender. "We've got ask Boy-Who-Lived find Salazar Slytherin's ghost!"  "We've got ask... Boy-Who-Lived... find Salazar Slytherin's ghost..." repeated Hannah nervous voice, like forcing say it.  "And work," shouted Tracey, "we'll stun Harry Potter, tie bring us!"   It said something, Hermione Granger thought, something rather sad - eight strolled back maze twisty little passages Hogwarts, time next class run without finding bullies - genuinely know whether Harry Potter led around ghost Salazar Slytherin phoenix what. And whatever Harry done, hoped work them. And hoped others vote Tracey's idea stunning Harry Potter carting unconscious body around attract Adventures. That possibly work real life, or, did, giving up.  Hermione looked witch witch, Tracey chatting Lavender, others making occasional remarks; gaze caught girl subdued quiet, one person whose thoughts right guess all.  "Hannah?" said girl walking alongside her. Hermione tried make voice gentle could. "You answer, okay I ask voted yes fighting bullies?"  Hermione thought she'd made voice soft, everyone stopped walking, Lavender Tracey halted conversation looked them.  Hannah's cheeks already reddening, Hannah opened mouth -  "It's 'cause got courage think, obviously," said Lavender.  Hannah paused mouth open.  She closed mouth.  She swallowed, hard visibly, cheeks reddened even further.  Then Hannah took deep breath, said, small voice, "There's boy I like."  The Hufflepuff girl flinched said it, head darted around nervously look everyone looking her, pause silence stretched.  "Um, okay?" Susan said eventually.  "I've got five boys I like," said Lavender.  "Padma I knew we'd like boys," said Parvati, "so made list flipped Knut see got pick first."  "I know I'm destined marry," said Tracey. "I care world says, he's meant mine!"  This made girls look expectantly Hermione, whose brain gone ahead flushed Tracey's last statement entirely could focus first thing Hannah said.  "Um," said Hermione. She carefully continued keeping voice gentle. "Hannah, reason joined Society Promotion Heroic Equality Witches there's boy might like become hero?"  The Hufflepuff girl nodded again, cheeks reddening even stared reflection black-polished shoes.  "She likes Neville Longbottom, actually," Daphne said. The Slytherin gave woeful sigh. "And unfortunately her, he's going marry someone else. It's tragic."  This produced high-pitched eeping sound Hannah went staring feet.  "Wait what?" said Lavender. "Neville's going marry someone else? How know this? Who?"  Daphne shook head sadly downcast expression.  "Excuse me," said Hermione, others looked again, "Ah..." tried organize thoughts. "I mean, um... Hannah... trying become hero boy like feminist."  "It's pronounced feminine actually," said Padma.  "And why're calling Hannah unfeminine?" said Susan. "There's nothing unfeminine wanting impress boy."  "Besides," said Parvati, sounding puzzled, "isn't whole point we're trying heroes even though feminine?"  The ensuing discussion would remembered Hermione Granger one successful forays realms political education. She tried explain, resulting argument tried explain again, seven girls looked more skeptically. Afterward Daphne declared imperious tones future Lady Greengrass feminism business meant girls allowed pursue boys whichever way pleased, feminism could stay Muggle lands belonged. Lavender suggested maybe witchism could say witches got anything wanted, sounded like fun feminism. And finally Padma closed discussion observing wearily see much point going arguing, since S.P.H.E.W. anything feminism first place, girls becoming heroes.  Hermione given point.   As Charms session day ended first-year Ravenclaws began shuffling class, Hermione already wincing herself. They'd made class barely opening gong, they'd run right desks sit down, time awful thing happen yet; meant Hermione got look forward coming disaster whole class.  Sure enough, Professor Flitwick squeaked dismissal everyone rose chairs, Harry began walking toward her; part Hermione shoved book mokeskin pouch quickly walked door threw open headed corridors, course Harry followed surprised look library session scheduled -  "Hermione?" Harry said closed door behind him. "What's wrong?"  The door flew open behind Harry moment closed it, almost hitting Harry stepped way, Padma Patil stepped classroom dreadful look determination upon face.  "Excuse me, Mr. Potter," came awful words, young girl's high voice resounding corridor like gloomy bells doom, "can I ask help something?"  Harry's eyebrows drew up, said, "You ask, course."  "Can tell us talk Salazar Slytherin's ghost? We want tell us find bullies, like tells you."  There little bit silence corridor outside classroom.  The door opened again, Su peered inquiring look -  "Well, we've got get library," Harry said quite casually, face looking relaxed, "would mind following us?" began walk direction led library odd-numbered days month, Su made like going follow Harry's face turned toward moment.  It Harry rounded corner drew wand, said low precise voice "Quietus" turned Padma said, "An interesting guess, Miss Patil."  Padma looked rather smug, then; said, "I figured earlier, really. There hiss ghost's voice, I thought Parselmouth right away, even started talking Godric Gryffindor."  Harry's face change. "May I ask, Miss Patil, whether shared thought -"  "She said front everyone S.P.H.E.W.," Hermione said.  Harry's eyes look rapidly calculating something, said, "Hermione, what's chance -"  "She said front Lavender Tracey."  "Um," said Padma. "Should I not've done that?"   "Wait here," growled Mr. Goyle, went around corner; sound knocking Draco Malfoy's private room.  There bit queasy feeling Tracey's stomach, reminded since Padma spilled beans someone bound tell Draco Malfoy, might well her, owed Harry Potter anything, Slytherin necessary achieve Ambitions.  She'd collecting Ambitions ever since Professor Quirrell told off, far she'd decided wanted own Nimbus 2000 broomstick, become super famous, marry Harry Potter, eat Chocolate Frogs breakfast every day, defeat least three Dark Lords show Professor Quirrell ordinary.  "Mr. Malfoy see you," said low, menacing voice Mr. Goyle returned. "And better hope think wasting time." The boy loomed briefly, stepped aside.  Tracey added servants list Ambitions, entered.  The Malfoy private bedroom looked like Daphne's. She'd privately hoping diamond chandeliers golden frescos walls - she'd never said front Daphne, House Malfoy step Greengrass. But small bedroom like Daphne's, difference Malfoy's stuff decorated silver snakes instead emerald plants.  As stepped doorway, Draco Malfoy - perfectly groomed even inside bedroom - rose desk chair greet small friendly bow, wearing charming smile like someone mattered, made Tracey flustered forgot everything she'd rehearsed inside head blurted out, "I've got something tell you!"  "Yes, Gregory said so," Draco Malfoy said smoothly. "Please, Miss Davis, sit down." He gestured desk chair, even sat bed.  She felt somewhat lightheaded carefully sat Malfoy's chair, fingers unthinkingly fiddling dress robes fell across knees, trying make look elegant uncreased Draco Malfoy's -  "So, Miss Davis," said Draco Malfoy. "What want tell me?"  Tracey hesitated, Malfoy's face started look bit impatient, stammered out, everything Padma said Salazar Slytherin's ghost sending Harry Potter stop bullies also Daphne told Hermione Granger -  Draco Malfoy's expression change spoke, even slightest, dawned Tracey sickening lurch stomach.  "You believe me!" said.  There slight pause.  "Well," said Draco Malfoy, smile quite charming last one, "I believe that's Padma said Daphne said, thank anyway, Miss Davis." The boy rose he'd sitting bed, Tracey, even thinking, rose chair.  As escorting door, turn knob, occurred Tracey - "You ask I wanted information," said.  Draco Malfoy gave kind look, quite know supposed mean, say anything.  "Well, anyway," Tracey said, making on-the-spot change previous Plans, "I want anything information, I friendly."  A brief look surprise crossed Draco Malfoy's face instant expression flattened said, "It's easy become friends Malfoy, Miss Davis."  Tracey smiled, meant it. "Well, I'll go friendly, then," said, left room skip step, feeling like real Slytherin maybe first time life, decided Draco Malfoy would one husbands too.   After girl gone, Gregory came in, shut door said, "Are alright, Mr. Malfoy?"  Draco said nothing servant friend. His eyes gazed nowhere, like trying stare wall bedroom, Hogwarts lake surrounded Slytherin dungeons, Earth's crust atmosphere interstellar dust Milky Way, utterly empty lightless void galaxies wizard scientist ever seen.  "Mr. Malfoy?" Gregory said, starting sound little worried.  "I can't believe I believed every word that," said Draco.   Daphne finished final inch Transfiguration looked across Slytherin common room, Millicent Bulstrode still working homework. It time come Decision.  If S.P.H.E.W. go around trying stun bullies, bullies like it, certain. And they'd try something unpleasant it, also certain. On hand, bullies got really nasty Hermione could ask Harry Potter help, could pool combined Quirrell points ask Defense Professor favor... No, thing Daphne really worried business got bad Professor Snape. You want ever end wrong side Professor Snape.  But since day she'd challenged Neville Most Ancient Duel, she'd noticed people looking differently. Even Slytherins who'd made fun looking differently. It dawning Daphne daughter Noble Most Ancient House Greengrass brought lot respect beautiful heroine born Most Ancient House, pretty noble girl. It difference role played lead actress role played two-Galleon extra screechy laugh.  Fighting bullies might best way become heroine. But Father told trouble passing opportunities was habit-forming. If told waiting better opportunity next time, why, next time probably tell thing. Father said people spent whole lives waiting opportunity good enough, died. Father said seizing opportunities would mean sorts things went wrong, nearly bad hopeless lump. Father said got habit seizing opportunities, time start picky them.  On hand, Mother warned take Father's advice, said Daphne allowed ask Father's sixth year Hogwarts least thirty years old.  But end Father gotten Mother marry successfully plotted way Most Ancient House, that.  Millicent Bulstrode finished homework began putting things away.  Daphne stood desk, walked over.  Millicent swung legs table stood up, slinging bookbag one shoulder, looked Daphne approaching, girl's expression puzzled.  "Hey, Millicent," Daphne said drew near, making voice low excited, "guess I figured today?"  "The thing Salazar Slytherin's ghost helping Granger?" said Millicent. "I already heard -"  "No," Daphne said hushed whisper, "this even better."  "Really?" Millicent said, equally low excited voice. "What it?"  Daphne looked around conspiratorially. "Come room I'll tell you."  They went toward stairs led downward, private rooms even lower lake seventh-year dorms...  Soon enough Daphne sitting comfy desk-chair Millicent bounced edge bed.  "Quietus," said Daphne, seated; instead putting wand away inside robes, Daphne let hand fall naturally side, still holding wand, case.  "All right!" said Millicent. "What it?"  "You know I figured out?" said Daphne. "I figured get gossip fast, know things actually happen."  Daphne half-expected Millicent turn white fall over, really, girl flinch pretty hard started stammering denials.  "Don't worry," said Daphne sweetest smile, "I tell anyone else seer. I mean, we're friends, right?"   Rianne Felthorne, seventh-year Slytherin, working diligently yet another two-foot essay (she taking everything except Divination Muggle Studies N.E.W.T. year seemed consist entirely homework) Head House strode table working barked "You come me, Miss Felthorne!" walked away even frantically began putting away parchment book quill.  When caught Professor Snape, waiting outside room gazing half-lidded eyes seemed far intense; could ask spun without word stalked hallways, scramble keep up.  Their walk took flight stairs, another, she'd thought lowest level Slytherin dungeons. And corridors began look older appearance, architecture reverting back time centuries roughened stone held together crude-looking mortar. She began wonder Professor Snape taking real dungeons she'd heard rumors of, true dungeons Hogwarts sealed faculty; maybe Professor Snape terrible things innocent helpless young girls probably wishful thinking part.  They went another flight stairs, came room room all, empty rock cavern single door, pierced many dark openings lit single torch ancient style fired entered.  Professor Snape took wand, then, began cast Charm Charm, lost track many; Potions Master done turned back toward her, locked intense eyes hers, said level voice unlike usual drawl, "You say nothing anyone matter, Miss Felthorne, nothing ever. If acceptable you, nod. If not, turn go."  She nodded, frightened strange hope dawning heart (well, exactly heart).  "The task I simple, Miss Felthorne," said Professor Snape's toneless voice, "and extremely generous pay fifty Galleons merely compensate Memory-Charmed afterward."  She drew involuntary breath. Her family might rich daughters kept tight leash certainly lot money her.  Then ears caught words Memory-Charmed moment felt outraged, point keep memories, sort girl Professor Snape think was?  "You surely know," said Severus Snape, "of Miss Hermione Granger, Sunshine General?"  "What?" said Rianne Felthorne sudden horror disgust. "She's first year!Ew!"   Chapter 72: SA, Plausible Deniability, Pt 7  The winter Sun well set time dinner ended, amid peaceful light stars twinkling enchanted ceiling Great Hall Hermione left Ravenclaw Tower alongside study partner Harry Potter, lately seemed ridiculous amount time studying. She faintest idea Harry actual homework, except getting done, maybe house elves slept.  Nearly every single pair eyes whole Hall lay passed mighty doors dining-room, like siege gates castle anything students ought go way back supper.  They went without speaking, walked distant babble student conversation faded silence; two went little stone corridors Hermione finally spoke.  "Why'd that, Harry?"  "Do what?" said Boy-Who-Lived abstracted tone, mind quite elsewhere, thinking vastly important things.  "I mean, tell no?"  "Well," Harry said, shoes pattered across tiles, "I can't go around saying 'no' every time someone asks something I done. I mean, suppose someone asks me, 'Harry, pull prank invisible paint?' I say 'No' say 'Harry, know messed Gryffindor Seeker's broomstick?' I say 'I refuse answer question.' It's sort giveaway."  "And that's why," Hermione said carefully, "you told everyone..." She concentrated, rembering exact words. "That hypothetically conspiracy, could confirm deny true master conspiracy Salazar Slytherin's ghost, fact even able admit conspiracy existed people ought stop asking questions it."  "Yep," said Harry Potter, smiling slightly. "That'll teach take hypothetical scenarios seriously."  "And told answer anything -"  "They might believe you, deny it," said Harry. "So better say nothing, unless want think liar."  "But -" Hermione said helplessly. "But - people think I'm things Salazar Slytherin!" The way Gryffindors looking - way Slytherins looking -  "It goes along hero," Harry said. "Have seen Quibbler says me?"  For brief second Hermione imagined parents reading newspaper article her, instead story winning nationwide spelling bee ways she'd imagined getting papers, headline said "HERMIONE GRANGER GETS DRACO MALFOY PREGNANT".  It enough make think twice whole heroine business.  Harry's voice turned bit formal. "Speaking which, Miss Granger, goes latest quest?"  "Well," said Hermione, "unless ghost Salazar Slytherin really show tell us find bullies, I think we're going much luck." Not sorry that.  She glanced Harry, saw boy giving peculiarly intense look.  "You know, Hermione," boy said quietly, though make sure nobody else world heard, "I think right. I think people get lot help others becoming heroes. And I think that's fair, either."  And Harry grabbed witch's robes lay arm, hustled side-hall corridor walking through, mouth gaping open surprise even Harry's wand came hand, rounded curve side-hall narrow almost pushing Harry other, even Harry pointed way they'd come softly said "Quietus", moment later, direction, "Quietus" again.  The boy looked searchingly around them, every side, even upward toward ceiling toward floor.  And Harry stuck hand pouch said, "Invisibility cloak."  "Gleep?" said Hermione.  Harry already drawing folds shimmering black fabric mokeskin device. "Don't worry," boy said small grin, "they're rare nobody bothered make school rule them..."  And Harry held dark velvet mesh her, said, voice strangely formal, "I give you, loan you, cloak, unto Hermione Jean Granger. Protect well."  She stared shimmering velvet cloak, cloth swallowed light fell except glinted small strange reflections, fabric perfectly black shown dust lint something didn't, longer looked felt like seeing really all, blinked black cloak.  "Take it, Hermione."  Hardly even thinking, Hermione stretched hand grasp fabric; brain woke started pull hand back, Harry let go cloak started fall grabbed without thinking. And instant fingers touched held cloak felt intangible jolt run like picking wand first time; like heard song sung, ever faintly, back mind.  "That's one quest items, Hermione," Harry said softly. "It belonged father, something I replace, lost. Don't loan anyone else, show anyone, tell anyone exists... want borrow while, come ask."  Hermione finally tore eyes loose depthless black folds stared back Harry.  "I can't -"  "You certainly can," Harry said. "Because there's nothing even tiniest bit fair finding gift-wrapped box next bed one morning, you... not." Harry paused thoughtfully. "Unless get invisibility cloak, case never mind."  Then implications invisibility cloak finally dawned her, pointed shocked finger Harry, though close enough together quite straighten arm properly, voice rose considerable indignation said, "So that's disappeared Potions closet! And time -" trailed off, even invisibility cloak still see Harry had...  Harry buffed fingernails robes artful nonchalance, said, "Well, knew trick it, right? And heroine mysteriously know find bullies - like listened bullies planning it, even though nobody age could possibly turned invisible spy them."  There pause silence.  "Harry -" said. "I'm - I'm sure anymore fighting bullies good idea."  Harry's eyes stayed steady hers. "Because girls might get hurt?"  She nodded, nodded.  "That's choice, Hermione, like yours. I decided obvious stupid thing everyone books, try keep safe protected helpless, get really angry me, push away go get even trouble, heroically pull successfully, I'd finally epiphany realize blah blah blah etcetera. I know part life story goes, I'm skipping it. If I predict I'm going think later, I might well go ahead think now. Anyway, point is, smother friends keep safe, either. Just tell front predictably going go horribly wrong, still want heroines that, fine."  It times like Hermione wondered ever going get used way Harry thought. "Harry, I really," voice stuck second, "really, really want getting hurt! Especially something I started!"  "Hermione," Harry said seriously, "I'm pretty sure right thing. I see could realistically happen would worse them, long run, trying."  "What get badly hurt?" Hermione said. Her voice felt blocked throat; remembered Captain Ernie saying Harry stared straight eyes bully bully bent finger back, Professor Sprout arrived save him; another thought came that, Hannah delicate hands fingernails carefully painted Hufflepuff yellow every morning, allowed imagined. "And - they'll never anything courageous, ever -"  "I think works like that," Harry said steadily. "Even goes mind-bogglingly wrong, I think works like inside human mind. The important thing believing someone break boundaries. Trying getting hurt can't possibly worse being... stuck."  "What wrong, Harry?"  Harry paused moment, shrugged little sadly, said, "What I'm right?"  Hermione looked back black mesh running hand. From inside cloak felt strangely soft yet firm palm, trying give hand reassuring hug.  Then lifted arm back up, holding cloak back Harry.  Harry move take it.  "I -" said Hermione. "I mean, thank you, thank lot, I'm still thinking it, take back now. And... Harry, I think right spy people -"  "Not even known bullies, rescue victims?" Harry said. "I've never bullied, I've realistic simulation, feel pleasant. Have ever bullied, Hermione?"  "No," said quiet voice, went holding Harry's invisibility cloak him.  Finally Harry took back cloak - felt small twitch loss inaudible song vanished back mind - started stuff black material back pouch.  As pouch ate last fabric, Harry turned her, break Quieting Barrier -  "And, um," Hermione said. "That's Cloak Invisibility, it? The one read library page eighteen Paula Vieira's translation Gottschalk's An Illustrated Scroll Lost Devices?"  Harry turned head back, grinning slightly, said exactly tone voice he'd used earlier students dinner, "I cannot confirm deny I possess magical artifacts incredible power."   When Hermione climbed bed night still trying decide. Her life simpler dinnertime, back practical way find bullies; choose again; herself, time, friends. In mind's eye kept seeing Dumbledore's lined face pain quite hidden, mind's ears kept hearing Harry's voice saying 'That's choice, Hermione, like yours.'  And hand kept remembering sensation cloak fingers, replaying over mind. There power feeling compelled thoughts return it, song she'd heard / heard part mind magic lay silent more.  Harry spoken cloak like person, telling take good care her. Harry said cloak belonged father, replace lost...  But... Harry really that, would he?  Just hand one three Deathly Hallows created centuries Hogwarts?  She could say felt flattered, went way beyond feeling flattered, making wonder Harry, exactly.  Maybe Harry sort person went around loaning ancient lost magical artifacts anyone considered friend, -  But thought part life Harry said he'd skipped over, part tried keep safe protected...  Hermione stared ceiling Ravenclaw dorm. Somewhere beyond bed, Mandy Su talking. She'd turned Quieting Charm hear exact words, could still hear faint murmur; something comforting sleeping dorm girls. Harry kept Quieter turned way, knew.  She starting wonder maybe Harry actually did, well...  You know...  Like her.  It took Hermione Granger long time fall asleep night.  And woke next morning small slip parchment peeking pillow said At half-past ten find bully fourth passageway left hall leaving Potions classroom - S.   When Hermione entered Great Hall morning, stomach filled flying butterflies size Hippogriffs; even approached Ravenclaw breakfast table still decided do.  There empty place next Padma, saw. That would sit down, going tell Padma ask Padma tell Daphne Tracey.  Hermione walked toward empty place next Padma.  There words waiting throat, Padma, I got mysterious message -  And could feel huge brick wall inside her, stopping words coming out. She'd putting Hannah Susan Daphne danger. Taking leading hand straight trouble. That Wrong.  Or could go try handle bully herself, without telling friends anything, that, quite obviously, also Wrong.  Hermione knew faced Moral Dilemma, like wizards witches she'd read stories. Only stories people always got right choice wrong choice, two wrong ones, seemed bit unfair. But sense, somehow - maybe came way Harry always talked history books would see - faced Heroic Decision, whole life might end going one way another, depending chose right now, morning.  Hermione sat table without looking either side, gazing plate silverware like might answers hidden inside, thinking hard ever had, seconds later heard Padma's voice whispering almost ear, "Daphne says knows bully's going ten-thirty today."   Doomed.  They doomed, Susan Bones's opinion.  Auntie sometimes told stories started like this, people something knew stupid, stories usually ended someone doomed floor walls getting Auntie's shoes.  "Hey, Padma," muttered Parvati, voice barely audible soft impacts eight girls tiptoeing corridor leading Potions classroom, "d'you know Hermione's sighing morning -"  "No talking!" hissed Lavender, harsh whisper sounding much louder Parvati's mutter. "You never know Evil might listening!"  "Shhh!" said three girls even loudly.  Utterly, totally, quite extremely doomed.  As approached fourth passageway left Potions classroom, Daphne's mysterious informant said bullying would take place, eight moved slower, sound feet got softer, finally General Granger made gesture meant Halt, I'll look ahead.  Lavender raised hand, then, Hermione turned look her, Lavender, looking puzzled, pointed straight corridor, gestured herself, tried sign something else Susan understand -  General Granger shook head, again, time slower, exaggerated movements, made sign Halt, I'll look ahead.  Lavender, looking even puzzled, pointed back way they'd come, made bouncing gesture hand.  Now everyone else looking even confused Lavender, Susan thought acerbity evidently one hour practice done two days ago enough remember new set code signals.  Hermione pointed Lavender, floor beneath Lavender's feet, expression face making clear intended meaning You. Stay. Here.  Lavender nodded.  Doom doom doom, went words Chaos Legion's marching song Susan's mind, doom doom doom doom doom doom...  Hermione reached robes, drew little rod mirror end eyepiece. Very softly indeed, Ravenclaw girl crept wall, right next passageway opened corridor, peeked tip eyepiece around corner.  Then little more.  Then little more.  Then General Granger cautiously stuck head around side.  General Granger turned back them, nodded, made hand gesture follow me.  Susan felt little better crept forward. The part Plan called arrive thirty minutes bully had, apparently, actually worked. Maybe slightly doomed...?   At ten-twenty-nine, almost dot, bully showed up. If anyone present hear - though corridor apparently empty - would heard shoes clicking solidly main corridor, entering passageway, walking toward passageway turned first corner, turning corner, stopping surprise upon seeing passageway terminated solid brick wall wall before.  Then bully shrugged turned away, leaned back watch main passage around corner.  It castle Hogwarts, all.  Behind hastily Transfigured thin panels they'd assembled outward appearance brick wall, girls waited; speaking, moving, hardly even breathing, watching eyeholes they'd left themselves.  As Susan's gaze took bully, could feel tightening chest way toes. The boy looked seventh-year older, robes trimmed green instead red they'd hoping for, muscles, staring bit longer, Susan realized stance balance meant dueled.  Then heard sound feet approaching corridor. The fourth-year Gryffindors Slytherins let Potions class.  The footsteps pattered past, diminished faded, bully anything. For moment Susan felt instant relief -  Then another, smaller group footsteps approached.  The bully still anything, footsteps went past.  That happened times.  And then, approached faintly audible sound one last set footsteps, seven girls heard bully's voice saying, clear cold quiet, "Protego".  Someone gasp then, though fortunately very quietly. If get even single shot -  The bullies learning already, Susan realized, expected S.P.H.E.W. able often bullies caught - - Hermione already defeated three bullies - school buzzing speculation Salazar Slytherin's ghost, yesterday -  He's expecting us!  Susan would whispered give up, abort plan, way convey message -  "Silencio," said bully soft, deliberate voice wand pointed toward corridor, blue haze Shielding Charm shimmering around him. "Accio victim."  When fourth-year boy came field vision dangling upside invisible hand holding high one leg, red-trimmed robes beginning slide thighs reveal pants beneath. His mouth opening closing helpessly, sound coming out.  "I suppose wondering what's going on," seventh-year Slytherin said quiet, cold voice. "Don't worry. It's simple even Gryffindor could understand."  With that, Slytherin's left hand formed fist drove hard Gryffindor's belly. The fourth-year boy's body jerked around frantically, still words left mouth.  "You're victim," said older Slytherin. "I'm bully. I'm going beat up. And we'll see anyone stops me."  It moment Susan realized trap.  And almost moment, rang mighty high-pitched voice young girl, crying, "Stop, evildoer! Finite Incantatem!"  Lavender, thought Susan, agonized. The Gryffindor girl volunteered distraction, rest executed flank attack bully expect it, plan, -  "In name Hogwarts," cried Lavender's voice, though see her, "and name heroines everywhere, I command let go EEK!"  "Expelliarmus," said bully. "Stupefy. Accio stupid heroine."  When Lavender floated vision, dangling one foot unconscious, Susan blinked; girl dressed bright crimson-and-gold skirt blouse, instead usual Hogwarts robes.  The bully also giving girl's upside-down body odd look, pointed wand said "Finite Incantatem," clothes stayed same.  Then bully shrugged, and, still facing direction Lavender instead dangling fourth-year boy, drew back fist -  "Lagann!" yelled five voices, five green spirals blasted five wands aimed five holes false wall, instant later Hermione's voice shouted "Stupefy!"  Five green spirals shattered ineffectually blue haze, Hermione's red bolt bounced haze struck fourth-year boy, jerked still.  And seventh-year bully turned around, smiling grimly, first-year girls screamed charged.   Susan's eyes flew open instantly rolling away she'd lain floor, lungs still fire whole body still aching she'd hit, battle moved forward seconds could see, Hannah's body falling arm still stretched toward Susan, "Glisseo!" shouted Hermione older boy slashed wand leaving trail green glow behind Hermione's Charm visibly disrupted shower blue-white sparks, almost motion bully said "Stupefy!" Hermione blown backward Susan summoned magic left shouted "Innervate!" Hermione's body even bully turned toward her, bully's wand pointed direction Padma yelled "Prismatis!" bully shouted "Impedimenta!", rainbow sphere forming around bully seventh-year Slytherin staggered hex reflected back him, instant later bully's wand swept back tap Padma's Prismatic Sphere shattered like blown soap bubble bully's wand cut "Innervate!" yelled Parvati Hannah's body Tracey Lavender screamed time, "Wingardium Leviosa!" -   Hannah Abbott held wand hand trembled exhaustion, enough magic left even one Innervate, now.  The rest passageway silent, scattered bodies lying across ground, Padma Tracey Lavender, Hermione Parvati heap one wall, Susan standing petrified rigor eyes tracked helplessly, even Gryffindor boy lying sprawled motionless (Hermione woken he'd fought, enough).  It short battle.  The bully still smiling, signs exertion wavering ripple blue glow surrounding him, beads sweat forehead.  The bully raised arm, wiped sweat forehead, stalked toward like man-shaped living Lethifold.  Hannah turned fled, spun ran screams kept bound choking throat, sprinted past fallen paneling fake brick wall, ran passageway speed could muster, weaving much could -  Just Hannah got turn passageway, bully's voice behind said "Cluthe!" got awful cramps legs, fell slid hit head wall, even notice pain smack started scream twisting muscles -  The bully still stalking toward her, Hannah saw turned head; approaching slowly, still wearing dreadful smile.  And rolled, despite pain leg muscles knotted around themselves, rolled around corner passageway, screamed, "Go away!"  "I think not," said bully, voice deep scary like grown man, sounding close hand now.  The bully walked around corner Daphne Greengrass stabbed Most Ancient Blade directly groin.  There flash lit whole corridor -   It subdued mien seven girls left Madam Pomfrey's office, leaving one behind hospital bed.  Hannah would right thirty-five minutes, healer said; torn muscles easy mend.  Daphne done talking, according her, Hannah suffered mishap Road-Running Charm caused leg cramps. Madam Pomfrey given sharp look argued, even though Charm around six years level.  Madam Pomfrey also given Daphne potion help state total magical exhaustion, warned cast spells next three hours. That, supposedly, Daphne using much magic trying Finite Hannah, rather Most Ancient Blade drawing power break Protego.  The rest decided say anything bruises robes could get older girls cast Episkey. There limits Daphne could talk around.  The whole thing, Susan thought, close, much close. If bully much looked around corner - he'd taken moment recast Shielding Charm -  "We stop," said Susan, soon seven gotten hearing range healer's office. "We stop this."  For reason, then, even though supposed vote sort thing, everyone turned look General Granger.  The Sunshine General seem see looking her, strode on, gazing straight ahead.  After little while, Hermione Granger said, voice sounded thoughtful little sad, "Hannah said want us stop. I'm sure right us to... less brave her, is."  All girls, except Susan, nodded that.  "I think that's got bad gets," said Parvati. "And handle it. We've proved now."  Susan think anything say that. She think shrieking top lungs blatant stupidity DOOM would persuasive. And leave girls, either. Wasn't enough cursed hard work, Hufflepuffs loyal top everything else?  "By way, Lavender," said Padma. "What name Merlin's underpants wearing back there?"  "My hero outfit," said Gryffindor girl.  Daphne sounded weary, spoke without turning head plodding hall. "It's costume Soldier Gryffindor play Chronicles Lunarian Soldiers."  "Did Transfigure it?" said Parvati, looking puzzled. "But bully cast Finite -"  "Nope!" Lavender said. "It's real! See, I Transfigured hero outfit regular shirt skirt beforehand, I cast Finite I saw bully. Do want own, Parvati? I got mine made yesterday Katarina Joshua sixth-year, twelve Sickles -"  "I think," General Granger said careful voice, "that would make us look little silly."  "Well," said Lavender, "we vote whether -"  "I think," General Granger said, "that matter anyone votes, I'm going caught dead wearing one costumes -"  Susan ignored argument. She trying think sort clever strategy less doomed.   The whole Great Hall went silent, even moment, seven walked lunch.  Then applause started.  It scattered, massive applause everyone applauding once. A lot came Gryffindor table, less Hufflepuff Ravenclaw, none Slytherin.  Daphne felt face tightening. She'd hoped - well, maybe found Gryffindor bully stop Slytherin rescue, fellow Slytherins would realize -  She looked Hufflepuff table.  Neville Longbottom applauding hands held high head, although smiling. Maybe he'd heard Hannah, maybe wondering Hannah there.  Then, quite able help herself, glanced toward Head Table.  Professor Sprout's face lined concern. She Professor McGonagall leaning heads toward Headmaster Dumbledore, solemn look, lips moving quickly. Professor Flitwick looked resigned anything else, Quirrell, face slack, taking trembling stabs soup using spoon gripped fist.  Professor Snape looking directly -  Her?  Or - Hermione Granger, standing next her?  A small, thin smile crossed Potions Master's face, raised hands, brought together motion slow real clap; Potions Master turned back plate, ignoring conversations around him.  Daphne felt little chill go spine, hastily turned walk toward Slytherin table. Susan Lavender Parvati peeled group, heading toward Hufflepuff Gryffindor tables side Great Hall.  It happened passing part Slytherin table Slytherin Quidditch team sat.  That Hermione stumbled suddenly, stumbled hard like yanked feet, went sprawling gap Marcus Flint Lucian Bole sat, sad little splutching sound Hermione's face ended Flint's plate steak mashed potatoes.  Everything seemed happen quickly then, maybe Daphne thinking slow, Flint let bellow indignation hand yanked Hermione back threw Ravenclaw table, bounced student's back collapsed onto ground -  The quiet spread ripples.  Hermione pushed hands, though get way feet, Daphne could see whole body shaking, face still covered mashed potatoes scattered pieces steak.  For long moment, nobody spoke, nobody moved. Like nobody whole Great Hall could imagine, Daphne could, happened next.  Then Flint's powerful voice, voice Slytherin Captain bellowed commands Quidditch pitch, said dangerous rumble, "You ruined food, girl."  Another moment frozen silence. Hermione's head - Daphne could see trembling - turned look Slytherin Quidditch Captain.  "Apologize me," said Flint.  Harry Potter started push Ravenclaw table, stopped abruptly, halfway feet, he'd thought something -  Then five people stood Ravenclaw table.  All Slytherin Quidditch team stood up, wands coming hands, students stood Gryffindor table Hufflepuff table without thinking Daphne turned look Head Table saw Headmaster still sitting down, watching, watching, Dumbledore watching one hand though restrain Professor McGonagall - one second someone would shout spell would late, Headmaster anything -  And voice said, "My apologies."  Daphne turned back look, mouth gaping open absolute shock.  "Scourgify," said smooth voice, mashed potatoes vanished Hermione's face, revealing Ravenclaw's surprised expression Draco Malfoy approached her, sheathed wand again, knelt one knee beside offered hand.  "Sorry that, Miss Granger," said Draco Malfoy's polite voice. "I guess someone thought funny."  Hermione took Draco's hand, Daphne suddenly realized happen -  But Draco Malfoy raise Hermione halfway drop her.  He pulled feet.  "Thanks," said Hermione.  "You're welcome," Draco Malfoy said loud voice, looking either side see four Houses Hogwarts staring total shock. "Just remember, cunning ambitious mean like that."  And Draco Malfoy went back seat Slytherin bench sat like - - he'd -  Hermione went nearest empty place Ravenclaw bench sat down.  A number people, rather slowly, sat down.  "Daphne?" said Tracey. "Are right?"   Draco's heart hammering chest hard worried might explode right chest shower blood, like curse Amycus Carrow used puppy.  Draco's face stayed completely controlled, knew (it'd drilled over) showed slightest sign fear feeling, Housemates would rip apart like swarm Acromantulas.  There'd time check Harry Potter, time plot, time think, instant realizing time start rescuing Slytherin's reputation right then.  From sides long Slytherin table, angry faces stared Draco.  But outnumbered faces looked puzzled.  "All right, I give up," said sixth-year boy Draco recognize, sitting across two places right. "Why that, Malfoy?"  Although mouth dry, Draco swallow. That would sign fear. Instead took bite carrots, moisture anything plate, chewed swallowed, thinking rapidly could.  "You know," Draco said, making voice cutting could - heart thumped even harder chest, everyone around stopped talking listen - "there's probably way make Slytherin look even worse attacking eight first-year girls four Houses working together stop bullies, I can't think how. This way get benefit Greengrass doing."  The puzzled faces stayed puzzled.  "What?" said sixth-year boy, "Wait, benefit?" said fifth-year girl sitting right.  "It makes Slytherin House look better," said Draco.  The Slytherins around giving quizzical gazes like he'd tried explain algebra.  "Look better who?" said sixth-year boy.  "But helped mudblood," said fifth-year girl. "How's supposed look good?"  Draco's throat closed up. His brain experiencing hideous malfunction think anything say except truth -  Then, "It's probably kind tremendously clever scheme Malfoy's got going," said fifth-year boy. "You know, like The Tragedy Light, everything looks like setback part plot. And ends Granger's head stick nobody suspecting him."  "That makes sense," someone said table, lot nodding.   "Do know boss's to?" Vincent muttered undertone.  Gregory Goyle reply. In mind could hear clearly master's voice, saying, I can't believe I believed every word that, day rumor started Salazar Slytherin showing Potter Granger find bullies.  "Mr. Goyle?" whispered Vincent.  Gregory Goyle's lips shaped words, Oh no, sound came out.   Hermione left lunch early day, reason felt hungry. Those seconds horrible humiliation kept burning mind, over, feeling face squishing mashed potatoes thrown air Slytherin's boy's voice saying 'Apologize me'... might first time whole life she'd felt like hating someone. The boy who'd thrown (Marcus Flint, they'd said name was) whoever cast tripping Jinx first place... she'd felt it, one horrible instant she'd wanted go tell Harry started getting creative behalf, object.  She minute Great Hall she'd heard sound running feet behind, turned see Daphne racing toward her.  And listened Sunshine Soldier say...  "Don't understand?" Daphne's voice barely shriek. "Just someone's nice mean they're friend! He's Draco Malfoy! His father's Death Eater, parents friends Death Eaters - Nott, Goyle, Crabbe, everyone around him, get it? They despise Muggleborns, want everyone like die, think good nothing sacrifice horrible Dark rituals! Draco next Lord Malfoy, he's raised birth hate he's raised birth lie!" Daphne's gray-green eyes stared fiercely her, demanding assent understanding.  "He -" Hermione said falteringly. She remembered rooftop, awful jolt started fall, Draco Malfoy's hand grabbing holding hard she'd bruises afterward. She'd tell twice finally let fall. "Maybe Draco Malfoy like -"  Daphne's whisper almost scream. "If end ten times hard helped you, life over, understand? I mean Lucius Malfoy would literally disinherit him! D'you know chance he's something?"  "Tiny?" said Hermione small voice.  "Zero!" hissed Daphne. "I mean none! I mean less zero! I mean chance small find three Magnifying Charms Point-Me spell - - ancient map centaur prophet! Everyone Slytherin knows he's plotting something want suspected, I heard someone say seen pointing wand tripped - see?This part Malfoy's plan!"   Draco sat eating steak roasted cauliflower florets Ashwinder sauce (it made real Ashwinder eggs, tasted like fire), trying laugh trying cry.  He'd heard plausible deniability, realized much mattered found Malfoys any.  "You want know plot?" said Draco. "Here's plot. I'm going anything next time people think I'm plotting something, sure."  "Huh..." said fifth-year boy. "I think I believe you, sound cunning enough really -"  "That's wants think," said fifth-year girl.   "Albus," Minerva said dangerously, "did plan this?"   "Well, I snap fingers table, I tell -"   The Defense Professor's quavering hand dropped spoon soup again.   "What mean, set up?" said Millicent. The two sitting cross-legged Daphne's bed, come straight Great Hall lunch. "With Seer's eyes stare Time Itself, I saw winning."  Daphne stared Millicent, merely mortal eyes rather narrowed moment. "That boy expecting us."  "Well, yeah!" said Millicent. "Everyone knows hunting bullies!"  "Hannah got hit really painful hex," Daphne said. "She visit healer, Millicent! If we're friends warned me!"  "Look, Daphne, I told -" The Slytherin girl paused, trying remember something, said, "I mean, I told you, I See come pass. If I try change it, anyone tries change it, really terrible, awful, good, extremely bad things happen. And it'll come pass anyway. If I See getting beaten up, I can't tell that, try go, -" Millicent stopped.  "And then?" Daphne said skeptically. "I mean, happens go?"  "I know!" said Millicent. "But probably makes eaten Lethifolds look like tea party!"  "Look, even I know that's prophecies work," Daphne said, paused. "At least prophecies work like plays..." Admittedly, sorts tragedies trying avoid prophecy made happen, where, hand, trying go along prophecy reason happened. But could make prophecies happen way clever enough; someone loved enough could take place; enough effort possible break prophecy outright... Then again, plays Seers never remembered Saw, either...  Millicent must seen Daphne's hesitation, girl started looking little confident. "Well," Millicent said sharply, "this play! Look, I'll tell I See hard battle easy one. But that's I do, understand? And I say 'hard' can't show up! Or - -" Millicent's eyes rolled back head, intoned hollowly, "Those try cheat destinies come sad gloomy ends -"   Professor Sprout shook head, face looking tight.  "But -" said Susan. "But helped Harry Potter one time -"  "And made quite clear me," Professor Sprout said voice sounded like someone using Shrinking Charm squeeze throat, "that Professor Snape's job, mine, keep order Slytherin House - Miss Bones, please, -"  "Yes, I to," Susan said unhappily. "I'm Hufflepuff, loyal."   "A mysterious parchment pillow?" said Harry Potter, looking sitting, Quieted nook studying. Then boy's green eyes narrowed. "It Santa Claus, it?"  Pause.  "Okay," said Hermione. "I'm going ask, going tell me, we're going pretend never said I know anything -"   Susan approached table soon older girl alone, glancing around Hufflepuff common room make sure nobody watching (the way Auntie taught it, obvious looking).  "Hey, Susie," said seventh-year Hufflepuff. "Do already need -"  "Can I please talk privately bit?" Susan said.   Jaime Astorga, seventh-year Slytherin, recently considered promising upstart youth dueling circuit, stood ramrod straight Professor Snape's office, teeth clenched tight sweat trickling spine.  "I distinctly recall," said Head House sardonic drawl, "that I warned you, number others morning, certain first-year girls might prove annoying, fighter incautious allowed taken surprise."  Professor Snape stalked slow circle around him.  "I -" said Jaime, sweat beaded forehead. He knew ridiculous sounded, much pathetic excuse. "Sir, able -" One first-year-girl able break Protego, matter sort ancient Charm used - Greengrass must help -  But clear Head House believe that.  "Oh, I quite agree," murmured Snape low tone, instinct menace. "They have. I begin wonder Mr. Malfoy, whatever plotting, point, Astorga. It cannot good repute Slytherin's House fighters, rather demonstrating strength, lose little girls!" Snape's voice risen. "It well good taste defeated little girl fellow Slytherin Noble House, Astorga, I would deduct points myself!"  Jaime Astorga's fists clenched side, think thing say.  It time Jaime Astorga allowed leave presence Head House.  And afterward, walls, floor, ceiling saw Severus Snape's smile.   That evening Draco visited father's owl, Tanaxu, green things green owls. The best Father able find owl purest silver feathers, great luminous green eyes, beak sharp cruel snake's fang. The parchment wrapped around Tanaxu's leg short point:  What doing, son?  The parchment Draco sent back equally short, said,  I trying stop harm done Slytherin's reputation, father.  In much time took owl fly Hogwarts Malfoy Manor back again, family owl bore another message Draco, one said only:  What really doing?  Draco stared parchment he'd unwrapped owl's leg. His hands trembled, held parchment light fireplace. Five words, carved black ink, scarier death.  There much time think. Father knew exactly long took message go Malfoy Manor Hogwarts back again; would know Draco delayed compose careful lie.  But Draco still waited hand stopped trembling, wrote reply, answer he'd thought Father might accept.  I preparing next war.  Draco wrapped parchment around owl's leg tied it, sent Tanaxu winging room, halls Hogwarts, night.  He waited, reply came.   Chapter 73: SA, The Sacred Mundane, Pt 8  The red jet fire took Hannah full face, flipping end-over-heels smacking head straight stone wall, pale face seemed linger instant, framed flying strands brown-golden hair, collapsed ground heap robes, third final volley blazing green spirals brought foe's Shield Charm.  The March days marched by, filled lectures study homework, breakfast lunch dinner.  The Gryffindor boy stared eight them, tension every line body's frame, face working soundlessly; hands released clenched grasp Slytherin boy's lapels, walked away without anyone saying word. (Well, Lavender almost said word - mouth opening indignation, maybe gotten chance declaim speech - luckily Hermione spotted made gesture meant SHUT UP.)  Then sleeping, course. You want forget sleeping seemed normal.  "Innervate!" said young voice Susan Bones, Hermione's eyes flew open lips drew air gasp, lungs feeling heavy like huge weight resting chest. Beside her, Hannah already sitting up, holding head hands grimacing. Daphne warned would 'hard' fight, creating certain trepidation Hermione, indeed them. Except maybe Susan, who'd shown appointed meeting-time, walked alongside without speaking, fought seventh-year bully last girl standing. Maybe Gryffindor reluctant fight last daughter Bones, maybe Susan gotten lucky; rate, Hermione tried sit again, she'd realized chest felt heavy was, fact, rather large body sprawled top her.  And want forget magic either, even actual moment casting spell formed small part day. It whole point Hogwarts, all.  "Okay, ride around skateboards?" said Lavender. "We could get places faster walking. And we'd look really awesome skateboards, Muggle artifacts may fast broomsticks look cooler - vote -"  As remaining fractions time, would fill according nature: gossip upper-year romances, books study sessions.  Hermione reached trembling hand grasp copy Hogwarts: A History fallen, ever-comforting book pace distant ended floor, red-robed upper-year girl "bumped" wall. And older Gryffindor witch walked away without look back, whispered "Salazar's -" word hurt anything Slytherins said mudbloods, 'mudblood' strange wizarding word Hermione knew word Gryffindor said. She get used it, get used hated. It still hurt much every time happened, somehow hurt even coming Gryffindors supposed good ones.  Harry divided eight soldiers among armies, ordered; he'd voluntarily given two Chaotic Lieutenants, sending Dean Thomas Dragon Army trading Seamus Finnigan Blaise Zabini, Harry said "underutilized" Sunshine. Lavender elected join SPHEW Sunshine; Tracey decided stay Chaos.  "So work charms General Potter?" said Lavender, Hermione ignored hard could. "I've got say, Traces, I think Sunshine General pretty well sewn - better luck convincing Hermione three one those, know, arrangements -"  Nobody figured yet Draco Malfoy plotting.  "Certain?" said Harry Potter, sounding rather reluctant. "You know rationalist ever certain anything, Hermione, even two two make four. I can't actually read Malfoy's mind, I could, I certain perfect Occlumens. All I say based I've seen Malfoy, lot plausible Daphne Greengrass thinks, actually trying show Slytherins better way. We should... really try go along that, Hermione."  (Well, Harry seemed think Draco Malfoy good guy. But trouble Harry also tended trust people like Professor Quirrell.)   "Professor Quirrell," Harry said, "I'm worried hatred Slytherin House seems developing Hermione Granger."  They sitting Defense Professor's office, Harry sitting far back teacher's desk (and sense pending disaster still noticeable, even then), empty bookcase still framing Professor Quirrell's balding head. The cup balanced Harry's thigh filled Professor Quirrell's obscure, probably-expensive Chinese tea, said something way Harry thinking lately he'd needed make conscious decision drink it.  "And concerns reason?" said Professor Quirrell, sipping tea.  "Yes, well," said Harry, "I'm going ignore - oh, stop that, Professor Quirrell, plotting restore Slytherin House's reputation since least first Friday year."  There might tiny crack smile, edges thin pale lips; again, might been. "I think Slytherin's House well enough end, Mr. Potter, regardless fate one girl. But I agree present outlook favorable little friend. The bullies two Houses, many powerful well-connected families, see Miss Granger threat reputation shame pride. As powerful motive hurt her, pales compared raw envy Gryffindors, see outsider gaining laurels heroism dreamed since childhood." Now smile Professor Quirrell's lips definite, though slight. "And Slytherin House hear Salazar Slytherin's ghost abandoned favor mudblood. I wonder even conceive, Mr. Potter, would react? Those believe would cheerfully kill Miss Granger insult. And Slytherins wonder deep down, quiet place within themselves, might perhaps true... inner panic something scarcely contemplated." Professor Quirrell sipped tea equably. "When experienced, Mr. Potter, see consequences advance plotting. As stands, ill-served willful ignorance human nature deem unpleasant."  Harry sipped tea.  "Ah..." said Harry. "Professor Quirrell... help?"  "I already offered Miss Granger help," said Professor Quirrell, "as soon I foresaw would develop. My student told me, polite terms, stay business. Nor would tell anything different, I expect. As I little truly gain lose matter, I hardly intend press point." The Defense Professor shrugged, teacup held steady exactly-right polite grip, surface liquid even ripple Professor Quirrell leaned back within chair. "Do worry much, Mr. Potter. Emotions run high around Miss Granger, less danger might imagine. When older, learn first foremost thing ordinary person nothing."   The envelope Slytherin System delivered Daphne lunch unsigned, always; parchment within named time place said, simply, "Hard."  That concerned Daphne. What concerned Daphne Millicent seem looking Tracey's direction lunch day. She'd stared straight ahead plate eaten. Millicent looked Daphne saw, direction Hufflepuff table, looked quickly back again; though Daphne far away see expression Millicent's face, since Millicent sat far away Tracey.  Daphne thought lunch, sick feeling stomach unlike anything she'd felt before, caused stop eating halfway first plate.  What I See come pass... probably makes eaten Lethifolds look like tea party...  It conscious decision Daphne made, nothing like Slytherins supposed do, weighing benefits herself.  Instead -  Daphne told Hannah Susan everyone, informant warned next bully going target Hufflepuffs particular, bully planned risk teachers' wrath order really hurt either Hannah Susan, like seriously, two needed stay one.  Hannah agreed stay it.  Susan -   "What here?" yelled General Granger, though sort yell whisper time.  Susan's round face change, like Hufflepuff girl suddenly developed sort experienced blankness Daphne's Mother used. "Am I here, really?" Susan said calmly.  "You said come!"  "Did I say that?" said Susan. She flipped wand casually one hand, leaning stone wall corridor waiting, reddish-brown hair somehow arranging perfect order yellow trim witch's robes. "I wonder why. Maybe I want Hannah get strange ideas. Hufflepuff loyalty, know."  "If leave," said Sunshine General, "I'll call mission abort, we'll go back study halls, Miss Bones!"  "Hey!" said Lavender. "We vote -"  "That's fine me," said Susan, keeping steady gaze end corridor merged tiled hallway they'd told expect bully. "I'll stay myself, then."  "Why -" said Daphne. Her heart throat. If I try change it, anyone tries change it, really terrible, awful, good, extremely bad things happen. And it'll come pass anyway... "Why this?"  "It's like me," said Susan. "I know. But -" Susan shrugged. "People always behave like themselves, know."  They pleaded.  They begged.  Susan even say anything anymore, kept watching, waiting.  Daphne nearly crying, kept wondering she'd caused this, trying change Fate making happen worse -  "Daphne," said Hermione, voice sounding much higher usual, "go get teacher. Run."  Daphne spun heels started pelt direction stony corridor, realized, turned back girls except Susan watching go, Daphne, feeling like throw up, said, "I can't..."  "What?" said Hermione.  "I think gets worse every time try fight it," said Daphne. That worked plays, sometimes.  Hermione stared her, Hermione said, "Padma."  The Ravenclaw girl tore right without arguing. Daphne watched go, knowing Padma good runner her, wondering maybe would turn reason help would come late...  "Bullies here," Susan said laconically. "Huh, they've got hostage."  They whirled, looked, saw -  Three older bullies, Daphne's eyes recognized Reese Belka top lieutenant one seventh-year armies, Randolph Lee number two Hogwarts dueling club, worst all, Robert Jugson III, sixth year, whose father almost certainly Death Eater.  All three surrounded Shielding Charms, blue hazes glowed beneath surface ribbons color showed occasional faceting above, multi-layered shields like three thought fighting serious duelists expended energy accordingly.  And behind them, bound supported glowing ropes, Hannah Abbott. Her eyes wide panicked mouth moving, though hear anything Quietus they'd put earlier.  Then Jugson made offhand gesture wand, glowing ropes flung Hannah them, small pop Hannah's body blew Quieting barrier, Susan's wand instantly pointing Hannah Susan's voice muttered "Wingardium Leviosa" -  "Run!" screamed Hannah, gently lowered ground.  But corridor behind front blocked glowing gray field, barrier spell Daphne recognize.  "Do I need explain about?" Lee said false joviality. The seventh-year duelist sporting smile reach eyes. "Well, case, little inconveniences, includes Miss Greengrass, quite enough trouble told quite enough lies. We brought little friend make sure everyone knew got - though I suppose Ravenclaw girl hiding around corner clinging ceiling somewhere? Well, matter. This -"  "Enough talk," said Robert Jugson III, "time pain," raised wand. "Cluthe!"  Simultaneously Susan pointed wand said "Prismatis!" small rainbow sphere formed midair almost instantly, miniature barrier condensed bright stayed intact even Jugson's hex hit bounced toward Belka, whose wand flashed swat away dark bolt; moment later many-colored blaze gone.  Daphne's eyes went wide moment; she'd never thought using Prismatic Sphere like -  "Jugsy, honey?" said Belka. Her lips widened vicious smile. "I thought discussed this. First beat them, play."  "P-please," said Hermione Granger faltering voice, "let go - I, I, I promise I'll -"  "Oh, really," said Lee annoyed tone. "Are offer turn let others go? We've got you, now."  Jugson smiled, then. "It could funny," said sixth-year junior Death Eater, softly menace. "How lick shoes, mudblood, one friends go? Pick whichever one like best, leave others get hurt."  "Nope," said young voice Susan Bones, "not going happen," blindingly fast motion Hufflepuff girl leapt leftward red stunbolt erupted Belka's wand, Daphne could hardly see movement Susan seemed hit corridor wall bounce like rubber ball legs smashed Jugson's face, go shield sixth-year went sprawling backward impact Susan followed downward foot stamped boy's wand arm, repelled shield, "Elmekia!" shouted Lee Parvati shouted "Prismatis!" rainbow wall formed fiery blue blast passed right like even there, bolt missed Susan inches, whirlwind motion Daphne follow Belka feet knocked her, older witch rolled back stand -  Daphne saw coming, lips started mouth "Pris-" already late.  Three blasts brilliance slammed Susan once, wand raised though could counter white flash hexes struck magical wood, Susan's legs convulsed sent flying corridor wall. Her head hit strange cracking sound, Susan fell lay motionless head odd-seeming angle, wand still clutched one outstretched hand.  There moment frozen silence.  Parvati scrambled Susan lay, pressed thumb pulse point Susan's wrist, - slowly, tremblingly, Parvati rose feet, eyes huge -  "Vitalis revelio," said Lee Parvati opened mouth, Susan's body surrounded warm red glow. Now seventh-year boy really grinning. "Probably broken collarbone, I'd say. Nice try, though."  "Merlin, tricky," said Jugson.  "You going second there, dearies." The seventh-year girl smiling all.  "Tonare!" screamed Daphne, raising wand head focusing harder ever life. "Rava calvaria! Lucis -"  She even see hex got her.   Hermione felt jolt Innervation bringing awake, intuitive strategism roll feet right away; completely hopeless battle know could instinct told leaping feet it.  Just crack, Hermione opened eyes, thin rays light entered showed Parvati backing away three bullies, last girl standing Hermione could see.  And eyes also showed Tracey fallen far away her, Hermione's wand still hand; so, desperately hoping Slytherin girl would show sense usually did, Hermione made wand movements subtly could, hardly moving lips, whispered, "Innervate."  Hermione felt spell working, Tracey move. Hermione hoped Tracey cunning, waiting to...  What could do?  Hermione know, panic waited moments fighting starting eat inside still, trying think, could see absolutely hopeless.  That Hermione heard thud, though field vision now, knew Parvati fallen.  A moment silence came, passed.  "Now what?" said voice scary-soft boy.  "Now wake mudblood," said precise voice scary-formal boy, "and find who's really behind them, Salazar Slytherin's ghost."  "No, dears," said voice scary-sweet girl, "first bind securely -"  And sound like lightning thunder Hermione's eyes widened shock could stop herself, widened field vision saw scary-soft boy convulsing yellow arcs energy crawled like giant blazing worms. His wand flew hand collapsed ground, twitching, moment later lay still.  "Is everyone else asleep now?" said voice. "Good."  Susan Bones rose floor near scary-soft boy stood, neck still oddly bent. Then rolled head around shoulders, casual loose motion, head straight again.  The round-faced first-year girl stood facing remaining two bullies one hand cocked hip.  Grinning.  And surrounded faceted blue haze.  "Polyjuice!" spat bully-girl.  "Polyfluis Reverso!" roared remaining boy bully.  Something like form mirrored scarf spat wand -  Passed without resistance haze surrounding Susan -  For instant, glowed strange mirror-color, like reflection -  And glow faded.  The young girl still stood there, hand hip.  "Wrong," said Susan.  "And truth," said Susan. "In case nobody ever told -"  In small hand wand rose up, blurred blue haze surrounding it.  "You mess 'Puffs," said Susan, grey flash bright hurt Hermione's half-closed eyes, real battle started.  It went while.  Some ceiling got melted.  The girl-bully tried cry truce, would leave take Jugson them, Susan roared syllables curse Hermione recognized Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting illegal seven countries.  Eventually girl-bully lay unconscious unawakenable ground, last boy-bully fled leaving companions' bodies behind, Susan leaned one wall, covered sweat scorched robes soaked wet spots, gasping breath, clutching right shoulder using left hand.  After Susan straightened up, turned look back fellow witches sleeping floor.  Well, sleeping floor.  Lavender already sitting eyes wide watermelons.  "That..." said Lavender.  "Was..." said Tracey.  "What?" said Hermione.  "I mean, what?" said Parvati.  "Cool!" said Lavender.  "Oh, hell," said Susan Bones. Her face already looked little pale beneath sweat, getting paler, looking almost frighteningly white. "Ah... could I convince hallucinated that?"  There rapid exchange glances. Hermione looked Parvati, Parvati looked Lavender, Lavender briefly locked gazes Tracey.  The four looked back Susan shook heads.  "Oh, hell," said Susan again. "Look I'll back minutes I've really got go please say anything bye!"  And Susan ran hallway, moving surprisingly fast, anyone could say another word.  "No, seriously, what?" said Parvati.  "Innervate," said Hermione, pointing wand Daphne, whose body able see before; Lavender pointed wand Hannah's body said same.  Hannah's eyes opened tried frantically roll feet, collapsed ground halfway through.  "It's okay, Hannah!" said Lavender. "We won."  "We what?" said Hannah little heap floor.  Daphne stirred, Hermione could see chest rising falling, breathing rhythm looked normal enough. "I think okay," said Hermione, "but -" She took moment swallow, mouth still dry. This gotten way, way, way hand. "I think ought take Daphne Madam Pomfrey's..."  "Sure, sure, give second I'll probably fine," said Parvati.  "Excuse me," Hannah said tone polite, firm. "How win? And ceiling look melty?"  There pause.  "Susan it," said Tracey.  "Yeah," said Parvati, voice slightly shaky stood started brush red-trimmed robes, "it turns Susan Bones Heir Hufflepuff opened long-lost entrance Helga Hufflepuff's Chamber Hard Work Practice."  "Huh?" said Hannah, feeling make sure body parts still there. "I thought something Professor Sprout says teach us Important Moral Lesson - Susan is?"  Slowly, Hermione beginning feel bit together. It really thirty seconds extreme terror, least parts she'd conscious for. "Actually," Hermione said carefully, mind started work again, "I'm pretty sure something Professor Sprout says, Hogwarts: A History anywhere else I've read -"  "She's double witch!" shouted Tracey, voice high cracked. "She is! She's one them! She's whole time!"  "What?" yelled Parvati, twisting around look Tracey. "That looniest thing -"  "Of course!" said Lavender, way feet starting bounce excitement. "I realized!"  "Susan's what?" said Hermione.  "A double witch!" said Tracey.  "You see," said Lavender, speaking rapidly, "There've always stories, children born super magicians cast spells one else can, there's whole secret school hidden inside Hogwarts classes see go -"  "Those stories!" yelled Parvati. "That's real life works! I mean, sure, I read books -"  "Just minute, please," said Hermione. Maybe mind feeling little slow all. "You mean even though already get go magical school everything, still want go double magical school?"  Lavender looked her, puzzled. "What?" said Lavender. "Who want super extra magical powers? It would like whole amazing destiny everything! It'd mean special!"  Hannah nodded that, looking she'd crawled Daphne's side checking girl broken bones. "I wish I double witch," Hannah said, then, sounding little sadder, "though I believe thing, really... see Susan do, exactly? I mean, sure seeing things getting stunned?"  Hermione truly, truly find words point.  "Oh, no," said Tracey. The Slytherin girl spun around look entrance corridor, robes fluttering around her. "Oh no! We've got get here! We've got get away Susan comes back someone Super-Memory-Charm us!"  "Susan that!" said Parvati. "I mean, even -"  "WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?" roared high-pitched squeaky voice, Professor Flitwick stormed partially melted corridor like small, dangerously compressed package pure academic fury, ashen-faced Padma gasping along behind him.   "What happened?" Susan blurted girl looked exactly like her, except scorched robes damp sweat.  "Ooh, great question!" said Susan Bones rapidly skinned left borrowed clothes. A moment later girl began Metamorphose back accustomed form Nymphadora Tonks. "Sorry I think anything got three minutes decide answer -"   As Daphne Greengrass observed afterward acidity, flaw Hermione's cunning plan make sure House points taken evenly four Houses got caught, work detentions.  They'd agreed keep mouths shut Susan's mysterious powers - even Tracey, Susan threatened Super-Memory-Charmed promise. Unfortunately, discovered dinnertime someone forgotten tell bullies agreement, also Susan Bones sacrificed soul dreadful forbidden powers inhabited hulk body they'd gotten detention.  "Hermione?" Harry Potter said beside dinner table, voice tentative. "Please take offense, I'll understand say none business, I think starting spin control."  Hermione went mashing slice chocolate cake plate seamless mush cake icing. "Yes," Hermione said, voice might little acerbic, "that I said Professor Flitwick I apologizing him, I knew things gotten hand, yelled: Really, Miss Granger? Do think? squeak loud ears caught fire. I mean ears actually caught fire. Professor Flitwick put again."  Harry put hand forehead. "Excuse me," Harry said. His face perfectly straight. "Sometimes I still little trouble getting used sort thing. Hey, Hermione, remember young naive still thought world relatively understandable place?"  Hermione put fork looked moment. "Do sometimes wish Muggle, Harry?"  "Huh?" said Harry. "Well, course not! I mean, even I Muggle, I'd probably tried someday take worrrrlllll-" Hermione gave look boy hastily swallowed word said, "I mean optimize course, know that's I really mean, Hermione! My point is, like goals would change one way another. But magic going lot easier get things done I stuff using Muggle capability set. If think logically, that's I'm going Hogwarts instead ignoring studying career nanotechnology."  Hermione, finished hand-crafting Chocolate Cake Sauce, began dip carrots eat them.  "Why ask?" said Harry. "Do wish back Muggle world?"  "Not exactly," Hermione said, crunched carrot chocolate. "I just, well, feeling strange wanted witch... Did want wizard little?"  "Of course," Harry said promptly. "I also wanted psychic powers super-strength adamantium-reinforced bones flying castle sometimes I felt sad I might settle famous scientist astronaut."  Hermione nodded. "You know," said softly, "I think witches wizards grow really appreciate magic properly..."  "Well, course don't," Harry said, "that's gives us advantage. Isn't obvious? I mean seriously, bloody obvious within five minutes walking Diagon Alley." There puzzled look boy's face, like understand paying attention something ordinary.   Chapter 74: SA, Escalation Conflicts, Pt 9  Harry walked forward step, another step, sense unease began pervade him, disquiet nerves.  He said nothing, lifted hand; pervading sense unease would say him.  From behind closed door office came whisper, carrying door though door present.  "It office hours," said cold whisper, "nor yet time meeting. I take ten Quirrell points you, glad more."  Harry stayed calm. Going Azkaban recalibrated scale emotional disturbances; losing House point, formerly rated five ten, lay somewhere around zero point three. Harry's voice likewise level, said, "You made testable prediction falsified, Professor. I wished note that."  As Harry turned go, heard door opening behind him, swung back around surprise.  Professor Quirrell leaning back chair, head lolling back rest, parchment floated him. Both Defense Professor's hands rested limply desk, though nerveless. He might corpse, excepting ice-blue eyes still moved, back forth, back forth.  The parchment vanished, replaced another quickly like material flickered.  Then lips moved well. "And this," whispered lips, "you infer what, Mr. Potter?"  Harry shaken sight, voice stayed even said, "That ordinary people always nothing, Hermione Granger danger Slytherin House thought."  The lips curved, ever barely. "So think I failed grasp human nature. But hardly possibility, boy. Do see other?"  Harry furrowed brows stared Defense Professor.  "I tire this," Defense Professor whispered. "You stand see yourself, else leave." As though Harry stopped existing, Defense Professor's eyes looked back parchment, scanning back forth.  It six parchments later Harry saw it, said loud, "You think prediction failed factor work model. Some reason Slytherin House hates Hermione realized. Like orbital calculations Uranus wrong, problem Newton's Laws, know Neptune -"  The parchment vanished, replaced. The head rose lolling position then, facing Harry directly, voice issued forth quiet, toneless. "I think, boy," Professor Quirrell said softly, something approaching normal voice, "that Slytherin House hated much, I would seen it. And yet three formidable fighters House something rather nothing, risk cost themselves. What force could moved them, willed motion?" The icy blue glitter Defense Professor's eyes met Harry's gaze. "Some hand possessed influence within Slytherin, perhaps. Then would hand benefited harm done girl followers?"  "Um..." said Harry. "It would someone threatened Hermione somehow, someone would get credit hurt? I know anyone fits profile, I know much anyone Slytherin outside first-year." The thought also coming Harry deducing hidden mastermind single mildly-unexpected attack seemed like insufficient evidence support prior improbability theory; Professor Quirrell deducing...  The Defense Professor looking Harry, eyelids slightly lowered though impatience.  "And yes," said Harry, "I sure Draco Malfoy behind it."  A hiss outward air like sigh. "He son Lucius Malfoy, trained exacting standards. Whatever seen him, even seem unguarded moments mask slips trust seen truth beneath, even may part face chooses show you."  Only Draco successfully cast Patronus Charm part keeping act. But Harry say that, course; instead grinned slightly, said, "So either really never read Draco's mind, that's want think."  There pause. One hands turned over, beckoned finger.  Harry stepped room. The door closed behind him.  "That something said aloud human speech," said Professor Quirrell's soft voice. "Legilimency, Malfoy's heir? Did Lucius Malfoy learn it, would assassinated outright."  "He would try," Harry said. It crinkle Professor Quirrell's eyes, Defense Professor's face unmoving. "But sorry."  When Defense Professor spoke again, voice become cold whisper. "I suppose I could, pity assassin." His head fell back chair, lolled one side, eyes longer meeting Harry's. "But small games hardly hold interest stand. Add Legilimency, ceases game all."  Harry hardly knew say. He'd seen Professor Quirrell angry mood twice before, seemed emptier, Harry know say it. What's bothering you, Professor Quirrell? could ask.  "What hold interest?" Harry said moments later, he'd worked safer-seeming strategy redirecting Professor Quirrell's attention positive things. Citing experimental results keeping gratitude journal strategy improving life happiness seem like would taken well.  "I tell hold interest," said icy whisper. "Grading Ministry-mandated essays hold interest, Mr. Potter. But I undertaken position Defense Professor Hogwarts, I see end." Another parchment appeared front Professor Quirrell's head, eyes began scan it. "Reese Belka held high position armies folly. I offer chance stay rather expelled, tells exactly forces moved her. And I shall make clear happen lies. I permit read faces."  The Defense Professor's finger pointed past Harry, toward door.  "But whether wrong human nature," Harry said, "or whether there's extra force work Slytherin House - either way, Hermione Granger danger predicted. Last time three strong fighters, happens -"  "She wishes help, yours," said soft cold voice. "I longer find concerns entertaining I did, Mr. Potter. Go."   Somehow, even though equals definitely charge, always Hermione ended speaking first sort situation.  The four tables Hogwarts, four Houses breakfast, glancing they, eight members S.P.H.E.W., gathered one side.  Professor Flitwick also staring sternly Head Table. Hermione looking there, could feel Professor Flitwick's gaze back neck. Literally feel it. It really creepy.  "Why'd tell Tracey wanted talk us, Mr. Potter?" said Hermione, tone crisp.  "Professor Quirrell expelled Reese Belka army last night," Harry Potter said. "And after-school Defense activities. Do see significance that? Miss Greengrass? Padma?"  Harry's eyes swept them, Hermione exchanged puzzled glance Padma, Daphne shook head.  "Well," Harry said quietly, "I actually expect to. But means danger, I know much danger." The boy squared shoulders, looking straight Hermione's eyes. "I going say this, but... I wanted offer put whatever protection I could give. Make clear everyone anyone messes you, messing Boy-Who-Lived."  "Harry!" said Hermione sharply. "You know I want -"  "Some friends too, Hermione." Harry take eyes hers. "And decision, yours. Padma? You told I owed debt I did, that's sort thing friend would say."  Hermione broke gaze Harry, look Padma shaking head.  "Lavender?" Harry said. "You fought well army, I'll fight wish it."  "Thank you, General!" Lavender said crisply. "I mean Mr. Potter. No, though. I'm heroine Gryffindor, I fight myself."  There pause.  "Parvati?" Harry said. "Susan? Hannah? Daphne? I know well, something I would offer anyone came ask me, I think."  One one, four girls shook heads.  Hermione realized coming, then, see single thing could it.  "And loyal soldier, Chaotic Tracey?" said Harry Potter.  "Really?" gasped Tracey, oblivious stabbing glares Hermione every girl directing her. Tracey's hands flew artfully cheeks, though actually manage blush, Hermione could see; brown eyes were, shining, least opened wide. "You'd that? For me? I mean - I mean, course, absolutely, General Chaos -"   And morning Harry Potter went Gryffindor table, Slytherin table, told Houses anyone hurt Tracey Davis, regardless time, would, quote, learn true meaning Chaos, unquote.  It considerable restraint Draco Malfoy managed prevent slamming head repeatedly plate toast.  They exactly scientists, bullies Hogwarts.  But even they, Draco knew, going want test it.   The Society Promotion Heroic Equality Witches announced it, seem like would good announce it. But quietly decided (or, case Lavender, shouted seven girls) take break fighting bullies while, least Heads House looking quite sharply anymore, older students stopped bumping Hermione walls.  Daphne told Millicent taking break.  And puzzlement, days later, Daphne looked parchment delivered lunch, drawn hand shaky almost unreadable, saying:  2 afternoon top stairs going library REALLY IMPORTANT everyone - Millicent  Daphne looked around, see Millicent anywhere Great Hall.  "A message informant?" said Hermione, Daphne told her. "That's odd - I -"  "You what?" said Daphne, Ravenclaw girl stopped mid-sentence.  The Sunshine General shook head said, "Listen, Daphne, I think need know messages come keep following them. Look happened last time, could anyone known three bullies would be, unless it?"  "I can't say -" Daphne said. "I mean, I can't say anything, I know messages come from, I know anyone know."  Hermione gave Daphne look that, moment, made Ravenclaw girl look scarily like Professor McGonagall.  "Uh huh," said Hermione. "And know Susan suddenly turned Supergirl?"  Daphne shook head, said, "No, I think might really important get message saying somewhere, everyone there." Daphne seen happened Susan, Daphne tried avert prophecy keeping Susan away. But she'd told afterward, Daphne afraid that...  She might possibly...  Might possibly Broken Something...  "Uh huh," said Hermione, McGonagall Stare again.   Nobody seemed know started, started it. If tried tracing afterward, tracked back word word mutter mutter, probably would found going huge circle.  Peregrine Derrick tapped shoulder left Potions morning.  Jaime Astorga heard whisper ear lunch.  Robert Jugson III discovered tiny folded note plate.  Carl Sloper overheard two older Gryffindors whispering it, gave significant glances walked past.  Nobody seemed know word began, first spoken it, named place, named time, said color would white.   "Every single one better absolutely clear this," said Susan Bones. The Hufflepuff girl, whatever strange power possessed her, even pretending act normal anymore. The round-faced girl striding halls firm, confident gait. "If get one bully, that's fine, fight regular way. My mysterious superpowers activate innocents danger. But five seventh-year bullies jump closet, know do? That's right, run away let fight them. Finding teacher optional, important thing run away soon I create opening. In fight like liabilities. You civilian targets I worry protecting. So get away fast possible try anything heroic help me, hour get healer's beds I personally show kick asses right back in. Are clear that?"  "Yes," squeaked girls, though Hannah's case came out, "Yes, Lady Susan!"  "Don't call that," snapped Susan. "And I think I heard you, Miss Brown! I'm warning you, I friends write plays anything dumb, posterity remember Lavender, Amazing Stupid Hostage."  (Hermione beginning worry many Hogwarts students besides Harry mysterious dark sides, whether likely develop one kept hanging them.)  "Alright, Captain Bones," said Lavender unusually respectful tone, turned another corner along shortest way library, passing rather large corridor studded six sets double doors, three sets either side. "Can I ask there's way become double witch?"  "Sign Auror preparation program sixth year," said Susan. "It's next best thing. Oh, famous Auror offers oversee summer internship, ignore anyone warns he's terrible influence almost certainly going die."  Lavender nodding rapidly. "Got it, got it."  (Padma, actually last time, giving Susan skeptical looks.)  Then Susan suddenly stopped place wand snapped said, "Protego Maximus!"  A jolt adrenaline went Hermione, instantly drawing wand spinning around -  But see anything wrong, greater blue haze surrounding all.  The girls, likewise pulled formation, also looking puzzled.  "Sorry!" said Susan. "Sorry, girls. Give moment check place out. Thinking certain person reminded hall we're right now, doors, would excellent place ambush."  There moment silence.  "Now," said harsh male voice, blurred unidentifiability buzzing undertone.  All six sets double doors slammed open.  White robes filed silently forward, all-concealing white robes without marks House affiliation white cloth hiding faces beneath hoods. They marched out, marched out, crowding great corridor numbers high count easily. Less fifty robes, probably. Certainly thirty. All already surrounded blue haze.  Susan said Extremely Bad Words, awful almost time, Hermione would noticed.  "That message!" Daphne cried sudden horror. "It -"  "Millicent Bulstrode?" said voice buzzing undertone. "No, wasn't. You see, Miss Greengrass, girl sends Slytherin message every day fight bully, pretty soon someone else notice. We'll talk we're done you."  "Miss Susan," said Hannah voice starting quaver, "can super enough -"  Wands rose many hands. There came series blinding flashes green light, massive volley shieldbreakers, end protective blue dome surrounding them, Susan fallen knees, clutching head.  Barriers solid blackness sprung ends corridor. Behind double doors Hermione could see into, unused classrooms, dead ends.  "No," said male voice buzz overlaid, "she can't. In case noticed, gotten quite lot people angry intention losing time. All right everyone, prepare fire."  The wands around perimeter aimed again, low enough enemies hit missed.  And another male voice, similar buzz accompanying it, suddenly said "Homenum Revelio!"  An instant later another massive volley shieldbreakers hexes, fired reflex suddenly revealed figure, shattering shields almost immediately begun form around -  And then, figure fell ground, stunned silence.  "Professor Snape?" said second voice. "He's one who's interfering?"  It Potions Master Hogwarts lay unconscious stone floor, dirt-spotted robes stirring final moment settled place, fallen hand outstretched toward wand slowly rolling away.  "No," said first male voice, sounding bit uncertain. Then rallied, "No, can't possibly it. He heard us passing word, course, came along make sure nobody screwed again. We'll wake afterward apologize he'll Memory-Charm children remember, he's Professor that. Anyway, make sure we're really alone now. Veritas Oculum!"  Fully two dozen different Charms must spoken, then, invisible people showed up. One particular made Hermione's heart sink; recognized Charm listed alongside description True Cloak Invisibility, would reveal Cloak, would tell whether certain artifacts nearby.  "Girls?" whispered Susan. She slowly pushing feet, though Hermione could see limbs swaying quivering. "Girls, I'm sorry I said before. If got anything clever heroic try, might well try it."  "Oh, yeah," Tracey Davis said then, voice trembling. "I almost forgot." The Slytherin girl raised voice, spoke.  "Hey, you!" yelled Tracey high-pitched shaky shout. "Hey, planning hurt too?"  "Yes, actually," said buzzing voice leader. "We are."  "I'm Harry Potter's protection, know! Anyone tries hurt learn true meaning Chaos! So going let go?" It sounded defiant. It came sounding terrified.  There pause. Some hoods robes turned face other, turned back face girls.  "Hm..." said buzzing male voice. "Hm... no."  Tracey Davis put wand away robes.  Slowly, deliberately, raised right hand high air, pressed thumb forefingers together.  "Go ahead," said voice.  Tracey Davis snapped fingers.  There long, awful pause.  Nothing happened.  "Yes, well," said voice -  Tracey said, voice sounding even higher shakier, "Acathla, mundatus sum." Her hand, stretching still further, snapped fingers second time.  A nameless chill went Hermione's spine then, frisson fear disorientation like she'd felt floor tilt beneath her, threatening spill darkness lying beneath.  "What's -" began buzzing female voice.  Tracey's face looked pale, twisted fear, lips moved, spilled forth sound high chant, "Mabra, brahoring, mabra..."  A chill wind seemed spring within confines corridor, dark breath caressed faces touched hands ice.  "Fire count!" shouted leading voice. "One, two, three!" maybe-forty voices roared spells, creating huge concentric array fiery bolts lit wide corridor brighter Sun -  - short moment bolts struck vanished upon dark red octagon appeared air around girls, disappeared moment later.  Hermione saw it, saw still imagine it; imagine Shielding Charm powerful, spell would withstand army.  And Tracey's voice went chanting, voice sounding louder confident, face screwed like trying remember something exactly.  "Shuffle, duffle, muzzle, muff.   Fista, wista, mista-cuff."  Now present could feel it, heroines bullies alike, sensation dark pressing them, tingling air something built built built. All blue hazes around white robes, shielding spells, died without visible hex touching them. There flashes light desperate spells fired, fizzled midair like candle-flames touching water.  The black barriers two ends corridor dissipated like smoke beneath growing pressure, evaporation revealed exits sealed, blocked tiled slats dark metal looked stained though blood; Tracey chanted "Lemarchand, Lament, Lemarchand," dreadful blue light began shine beneath metal slats them; six sets double doors slammed shut once, panicked white-robed bullies began pound howl.  Then Tracey's hand slashed left, cried "Khornath!", hand pointed "Slaaneth!", "Nurgolth!", then, right, "TZINTCHI!"  Tracey paused, took deep breath; Hermione found voice cried, "Stop! Tracey, stop!"  But strange wild smile Tracey's face. She raised hand still higher, snapped fingers third time; spoke again, beneath high girlish voice undertone though lower chorus chanting along her.  "Darkness beyond darkness, deeper pitchest black.   Buried beneath flow time...   From darkness darkness, voice echoes emptiness,   Unknown death, known life."     "What doing?" shrieked Parvati, Gryffindor girl stretched hand though pull Slytherin, starting float upward air; Daphne Susan grabbed Parvati's arm time Daphne cried out, "Don't, know happen ritual interrupted!"  "Well happens gets COMPLETED?" screamed Hermione, close she'd ever come total brain meltdown.  Susan's face white chalk, whispered, "I'm sorry, Mad-Eye..."  And Tracey spoke on, body floating higher higher floor, black hair whipping wildly around chill winds.  "You know gate, gate, key guardian gate:   I bid open way him, manifest power me!"  The corridor plunged utter darkness silence, Tracey could seen heard, like nothing left universe except light illuminating nameless source.  The shining girl raised hand one final time, dreadful gravity, pressed thumb forefinger together.  And within darkness Hermione looked Tracey's face saw Slytherin girl's eyes now, exact shade, green Harry Potter's.  "Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres!   Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres!   HARRY JAMES POTTER-EVANS-VERRES!"  There snap like thunder, -   Harry chosen assume rather relaxed posture, sat low chair mighty desk Headmaster Hogwarts: one leg cocked knee, arms sprawling casually either side. Harry best disregard noise surrounding devices, although one directly behind sounded like owl hooting desperately put woodchipper pretty difficult ignore.  "Harry," old wizard said behind desk, aged voice level blue eyes stared beneath shining half-moon spectacles. Headmaster Dumbledore garbed robes midnight purple; true formal black, dark enough come close indeed deadly seriousness, wizarding world counted meaning fashions. "Were you... responsible this?"  "I cannot deny influence work," Harry said.  The old wizard took glasses, leaned forward stare Harry directly, blue eyes green. "I ask one question," Headmaster said quiet voice. "Do think today - appropriate?"  "They bullies came hallway direct intent hurting Hermione Granger seven first-year children," Harry said levelly. "If I young moral judgment, neither they. No, Headmaster, deserve die. But deserve stripped naked glued ceiling."  The old wizard put glasses back on. For first time Harry seen him, Headmaster seemed loss words. "As Merlin witness," said Dumbledore, "I faintest notion I ought react this."  "That's pretty much effect I aiming for," said Harry. He felt like ought whistling merry tune, unfortunately never learned whistle reliably.  "I need ask directly responsible," said Headmaster. "Only three wizards within Hogwarts might powerful enough. I it. Severus assured involved. And third..." The Headmaster shook head dismay. "You loaned Defense Professor Cloak, Harry. I think wise. For escaped detection simple Charms, surely knows Deathly Hallow - if, indeed, know first touch upon flesh."  "Professor Quirrell already deduced possession invisibility cloak," Harry said. "And knowing him, probably guessed Deathly Hallow. But case, Headmaster, happens Professor Quirrell one face-concealing white robes."  There another pause.  "How cunning," said Headmaster. He leaned back throne sighed. "I spoken Defense Professor. Just you, indeed. I quite know say. I told approved Hogwarts policy dealing infractions hallway discipline, I feel appropriate Hogwarts professor done."  "And Professor Quirrell say that?" said Harry, impressed Hogwarts's current policies enforcing hallway discipline.  The Headmaster wore look resignation. "He said: Fire me."  Somehow Harry managed cheer loud.  The Headmaster frowned. "But it, Harry?"  "Because Professor Quirrell like school bullies I asked politely," said Harry. And feeling bored I thought might cheer up. "Either part incredibly deep plot."  The Headmaster rose behind desk, began pace back forth hatstand held Sorting Hat red slippers. "Harry, feel gotten bit..."  "Awesome?" offered Harry.  "Utterly completely hand would say better," said Dumbledore. "I sure ever time whole history school things become so, so... I word this, Harry, things never become like before, one ever needed invent word it."  Harry would tried invent words express deeply complimented felt, snerkling hard speak.  The Headmaster regarding increasing graveness. "Harry, understand I find events concerning?"  "Honestly?" said Harry. "No, really. I mean, course Professor McGonagall would object anything breaks dull monotony Hogwarts school experience. But Professor McGonagall set chicken fire."  The frown lines deepened Dumbledore's wrinkled face. "That, Harry, disturbs me," Headmaster said quietly. "There full battle fought halls!"  "Headmaster," Harry said, trying keep voice carefully respectful, "Professor Quirrell I choose battle happen. The bullies that. We decided Light side win. I know times boundaries morality uncertain, case line separating villains heroines twenty meters tall drawn white fire. Our intervention may weird, certainly wrong -"  Dumbledore gone back desk, sat padded throne dull thump, covering face hands.  "Am I missing something here?" Harry said. "I thought secretly side, Headmaster. It Gryffindor thing do. The Weasley twins would approve, Fawkes would approve -" Harry glanced golden perch, empty; either phoenix important things do, Headmaster invited today's meeting.  "That," said Headmaster old tired somewhat muffled voice, "is precisely problem, Harry. There reason courageous young heroes put charge schools."  "All right," Harry said. He quite keep skepticism voice. "What I missing time?"  The old wizard lifted head, face solemn, calmer. "Listen, Harry," said Dumbledore, "hear well; wield power must learn time. Some things world are, indeed, truly simple. If pick stone drop again, earth heavier it, stars move paths. I say this, Harry, know I pretending wise, I tell even things simple, others complex. There greater wizardries leave marks upon world, marks upon wield them, simple Charm would not. Those wizardries demand hesitation, consideration consequence, moment weigh meaning marks. And yet intricate magics known simpler simplest soul. People, Harry, people always marked, by done them. Do you, then, understand say, 'Here line hero villain!' enough say right?"  "Headmaster," Harry said evenly, "this decision I made random. No, I know exact effect every single one bullies present. But I always waited perfect information I acted, I would never anything. When comes future psychological development of, say, Peregrine Derrick, beating eight first-year girls probably good him. And enough stop quietly quickly, since would try later; see protective power worth fearing." Harry's voice stayed level. "But course, since I good guy, I want permanently injure even cause pain; yet penalty enough weigh minds anyone thinking trying again. So, weighing expected outcomes best I could boundedly rational intellect, I thought would wisest strip bullies naked glue ceiling."  The young hero stared directly old wizard's gaze, unflinching green eyes locked blue behind spectacles.  And since I anything personally, there's lawful way punish Hogwarts school rules; one acted Professor Quirrell, he's fireproof. And breaking rules get wise thing to hero grooming fight Lord Voldemort... This time Harry actually tried think ramifications advance, he'd made suggestion Professor Quirrell; Defense Professor called fool, slowly smiled begun laugh.  "I understand intentions, Harry," old wizard said. "You think taught bullies Hogwarts lesson. But Peregrine Derrick could learn lesson, would Peregrine Derrick. He provoked - fair, right, way is." The old wizard closed eyes, though brief pain, opened again. "Harry, painful truth hero must learn right cannot, not, must win every battle. All began Miss Granger fought three older enemies won. If content this, echoes deed would died away time. Yet instead banded together classmates raised wand open challenge Peregrine Derrick kind; kind cannot raise wands answer. So Jaime Astorga went hunting her, natural course would beaten her; would sad day, would ended there. There enough magic eight first-year witches together defeat foe. But could accept that, Harry, could let Miss Granger learn lessons; sent Defense Professor watch invisibly, pierce Astorga's shields Daphne Greengrass struck -"  What? thought Harry.  The old wizard went speaking. "Each time intervened, Harry, escalated matters yet further. Soon Miss Granger facing Robert Jugson himself, son Death Eater, two strong allies side. Painful indeed would her, Miss Granger lost battle. And yet Quirinus's hand, time shown openly, won."  Harry still struggling notion Defense Professor watching invisibly S.P.H.E.W., guarding heroines harm.  "And so," old wizard finished, "that came today, Harry, forty-four students attacking eight first-year witches. A full battle halls! I know intent, must accept measure responsibility. Such things happen came school, decades Hogwarts; neither I student I Professor."  "Thank much," Harry said evenly. "Though I think Professor Quirrell deserves credit me."  The blue eyes widened. "Harry..."  "Those bullies attacking victims long year," Harry said. Despite best efforts, voice starting rise. "But nobody seems taught students they're allowed fight back. I know much harder ignore two-sided fight helpless victims getting hexed almost pushed windows, exactly worse, it? I wish I'd read Godric Gryffindor's writings I could quote him, there's got something this. Open battle may louder victims suffering silence, may harder pretend nothing happening, final result better -"  "No, not," Dumbledore said. "It not, Harry. To always fight darkness, never let evil pass unchallenged - heroism, simple pride. Even Godric Gryffindor think every war worth fighting, though went whole life one battle another." The old wizard's voice went quieter. "In truth, Harry, words speak - evil. No, evil, yet frightened me. You one might someday wield great power, wizardry, fellow wizards. And if, come day, still think evil must never pass unchallenged -" Now note real worry entered Headmaster's voice. "The world grown fragile since age Hogwarts raised; I fear cannot bear fury another Godric Gryffindor. And slower wrath you." The old wizard shook head. "You ready fight, Harry. Much ready fight, Hogwarts becoming violent place around you."  "Well," Harry said carefully, weighing words. "I know help say this, I think getting wrong impression I'm about. I like real fighting either. It's scary, violent, somebody might get hurt. But I fight today, Headmaster."  The Headmaster frowned. "You sent Defense Professor place -"  "Professor Quirrell fighting either," Harry said calmly. "There anyone strong enough fight him. What happened today fighting, winning."  It old wizard spoke. "That may may be," Headmaster said, "but conflicts must end. I hear strain air, clashes, rises. All must end, decisively soon; must stand way ending."  The old wizard gestured toward great oaken door office, Harry departed it.   It surprise Harry stepped huge grey gargoyles made way him, saw Quirinus Quirrell still slumped stone corridor wall, thick thread spittle drooling slack mouth onto Professorial robes, position he'd occupied Harry first gone Headmaster's office.  Harry waited, slumped man rise up; long awkward seconds, Harry began walk corridor again.  "Mr. Potter?" came soft call, Harry turned two corners; quiet voice carrying unnaturally halls.  When Harry returned found Professor Quirrell still slumped wall, pale eyes watched keen intelligence.  I'm sorry tired -  It something Harry say. He'd noticed correlation effort Professor Quirrell expended time spend 'resting'. But Harry reasoned effort painful detrimental, surely Professor Quirrell would say no. Now Harry wondering reasoning actually correct, not, apologize...  The Defense Professor spoke quiet voice, rest body unmoving. "How went meeting Headmaster, Mr. Potter?"  "I'm sure," Harry said. "Not way I predicted. He seems believe Light lose lot often I'd consider wise. Plus I'm sure understands difference trying fight trying win. It explains lot, actually..." Harry read much Wizarding War, he'd read enough know good guys probably acquired pretty accurate picture worst Death Eaters were, owled hand grenades course five minutes.  A soft, soft laugh pale lips. "Dumbledore comprehend enjoyment winning, comprehend enjoyment game. Tell me, Mr. Potter. Did suggest little plan deliberate intention relieving tedium?"  "That among many motives," Harry said, instinct warned say Yes.  "Do know," Defense Professor said soft reflective tones, "there tried soften darker moods, indeed participated brightening day, first person ever succeed deliberately?" The Defense Professor seemed straighten wall peculiar motion might included magic well muscle; Defense Professor began walk away without look back Harry's direction. Only single small gesture one finger indicated Harry follow.  "I particularly enjoyed chant composed Miss Davis," said Professor Quirrell walked short distance. "Though might wiser consult advance, giving to memorize." One hand bestirred within Defense Professor's robes drew forth wand, traced small gesture air, faraway sounds castle Hogwarts fell silent. "Tell honestly, Mr. Potter, somehow acquired familiarity theory Dark rituals? That confessing intent cast them; many wizards know principles."  "No..." Harry said slowly. He decided time ago trying sneak Restricted Section Hogwarts library, much reason he'd decided year earlier look make explosives common household materials. Harry prided least sense people thought did.  "Oh?" said Professor Quirrell. The man walking normally now, lips curved peculiar smile. "Why, perhaps possess natural talent field, then."  "Yes, well," Harry said wearily. "I suppose Dr. Seuss also natural talent Dark rituals, part shuffle, duffle, muzzle, muff came children's book called Bartholomew Oobleck -"  "No, part," said Professor Quirrell. His voice grew little stronger, took normal lecturing tone. "An ordinary Charm, Mr. Potter, cast merely speaking certain words, making precise motions wand, expending strength. Even powerful spells may invoked way, magic efficient well efficacious. But greatest magics, speech alone suffice give structure. You must perform specific actions, make significant choices. Nor temporary expenditure strength sufficient set motion; ritual requires permanent sacrifice. The power greater spell, compared ordinary Charms, like day compared night. But many rituals - indeed, - happen demand least one sacrifice might inspire squeamishness. And entire field ritual magic, containing furthest interesting reaches wizardry, widely regarded Dark. With exceptions carved tradition, course." Professor Quirrell's voice took sardonic tinge. "The Unbreakable Vow useful certain wealthy Houses outlawed entirely - even though bind man's days indeed dread terrible act, fearsome many lesser rituals wizards shun. A cynic might conclude rituals prohibited much matter morality, habit. But I digress..." Professor Quirrell made brief coughing sound, clearing throat. "The Unbreakable Vow requires three participants three sacrifices. The one receives Unbreakable Vow must one could come trust Vower, chooses instead demand Vow them, sacrifice possibility trust. The one makes Vow must someone could chosen Vow demands them, sacrifice capacity choice. And third wizard, binder, permanently sacrifices small portion magic, sustain Vow forever."  "Ah," Harry said. "I'd wondered spell used place, every time two people difficulty trusting other... although... wizards deathbeds charge money bind Unbreakable Vows, use leave inheritance children -"  "Because stupid," said Professor Quirrell. "There hundreds useful rituals could performed men much sense; I could name twenty without stopping draw breath. But case, Mr. Potter, thing rituals - whether choose term Dark - shaped magically efficacious, appear impressive performed. I suppose certain tendency powerful rituals require dreadful sacrifices. Even so, terrible ritual known demands rope hanged man sword slain woman; ritual promised summon Death - though truly meant I know care discover, since also said counterspell dismiss Death lost. The dread chant I encountered sound even hundredth fearsome chant composed Miss Davis. Those among bullies passing familiarity Dark rituals - I certain - must terrified beyond capacity words describe. If existed true ritual appeared impressive, Mr. Potter, would melt Earth."  "Um," said Harry.  Professor Quirrell's lips twisted further. "Ah, truly amusing thing this. You see, Mr. Potter, chant every ritual names sacrificed, gained. The chant gave Miss Davis spoke, first, darkness beyond darkness, buried beneath flow time, knows gate, gate. And second thing spoken of, Mr. Potter, manifestation presence. And always, element ritual, first named sacrificed, said use commanded it."  "I... see," said Harry, trod halls Hogwarts Professor Quirrell, following toward Defense Professor's office. "So chant, way I wrote it, implies Outer God, Yog-Sothoth -"  "Was permanently sacrificed ritual briefly manifested presence," said Professor Quirrell. "I suppose discover tomorrow whether anyone took seriously, read newspapers see whether magical nations world banding together desperate effort seal incursion reality."  They walked on, Defense Professor began chuckling, odd throaty sounds.  The two talk came Defense Professor's office, man halted hand upon door.  "It strange thing," Defense Professor said, voice soft again, almost inaudible. The man looking Harry, Harry saw back. "A strange thing... There time I would sacrificed finger wand hand, work upon bullies Hogwarts worked upon day. To make fear fear you, deference students adoration many, I would given finger that. You everything I wanted then. All I know human nature says I hate you. And yet I not. It strange thing."  It touching moment, instead Harry felt coldness traveling spine, though little fish sea, vast white shark looked decided visible hesitation eat him.  The man opened door Defense Professor's office, passed within, gone.   Aftermath:  Her fellow Slytherins looking Daphne like... like faintest idea look her.  The Gryffindors looking like faintest idea look her.  Showing fear, Daphne Greengrass strode Potions classroom, wrapped imperious dignity Noble Most Ancient House. Inside feeling much way everyone else probably did.  It two hours since What? What? happened Daphne's brain still going: What? What? What?  The classroom quiet waited Professor Snape arrive. Lavender Parvati sat near cluster Gryffindors, surrounded silent stares. The two looking other's homework class started, nobody else helping talking them. Even Lavender, Daphne would sworn could never fazed anything, seemed subdued.  Daphne sat desk, took Magical Draughts Potions bag, began looking homework, best act normal. People stared her, said nothing -  A gasp went whole classroom. Girls boys flinched back, leaning away door like stalks wheat touched gust wind.  In door stood Tracey Davis, wrapped black tattered cloak draped Hogwarts uniform.  Tracey walked slowly classroom, swaying slightly step, looking like trying drift. She sat accustomed desk, happened right next Daphne's.  Slowly Tracey's head turned stare Daphne.  "See?" Slytherin girl said low, sepulchral tone. "I told I'd get did."  "What?" blurted Daphne, immediately wished said anything.  "I got Harry Potter Granger did." Tracey's voice still low, eyes gleaming triumph. "See, Daphne, General Potter wants girl pretty face pretty dress. He wants girl willing channel dread powers, that's wants. Now I'm - he's mine!"  This announcement produced frozen silence whole classroom.  "Excuse me, Miss Davis," said cultured voice Draco Malfoy, seemed unconcerned shuffled Potions parchments. The scion Most Ancient House much glance desk, even everyone else turned look him. "Did Harry Potter actually tell that? Using words?"  "Well, no..." Tracey said, eyes flashed angrily. "But he'd better take in, I've sacrificed soul everything!"  "You sacrificed soul Harry Potter?" gasped Millicent. There clatter side room Ron Weasley dropped inkwell.  "Well, I'm pretty sure I did," said Tracey, sounding briefly uncertain rallied. "I mean, I looked mirror I look paler now, I always feel darkness surrounding me, I conduit dread powers everything... Daphne, also saw eyes go green, right? I see that's I heard afterward."  There pause, broken sounds Ron Weasley trying clean desk.  "Daphne?" said Tracey.  "I believe it," said angry voice. "There's way next Dark Lord would take bride!"  Slowly, considerable disbelief, heads turned stare Pansy Parkinson.  "Hush, you," said Tracey, "or I'll..." The Slytherin girl paused. Then Tracey's voice went even lower, said, "Hush, you, I'll devour soul."  "You can't that," said Pansy, confident tones hen worked perfectly good pecking order top, go updating belief based mere evidence.  Slowly, like trying float, Tracey got desk. There gasps. Daphne felt like she'd Petrified place within chair.  "Tracey?" said Lavender small voice. "Please again. Please?"  Now Pansy showing definite nervousness Tracey swayed toward desk. "What d'you think doing?" Pansy said, quite managing sound indignant.  "I told you," Tracey said menacingly. "I'm going devour soul."  Tracey bent Pansy, sat frozen desk; and, lips almost touching, made loud inhaling noise.  "There!" said Tracey straightened. "I ate soul."  "No didn't!" said Pansy.  "Did too!" said Tracey.  There slight pause -  "Merlin, did!" cried Theodore Nott. "You look pale now, eyes seem empty!"  "What?" screeched Pansy, turning pale. The girl leapt desk began frantically rummaging bookbag. After Pansy drew mirror looked herself, turned even paler.  Daphne abandoned pretense aristocratic poise let head fall desk dull thud, wondered whether going school important families really worth going school Chaos Legion.  "Ooh, trouble now, Pansy," said Seamus Finnigan. "I know exactly happens Dementor Kisses you, Tracey Davis kisses that's probably even worse."  "I've heard people without souls," Dean Thomas said gloomily. "They dress black, write awful poetry, nothing ever makes happy. They're angsty."  "I want angsty!" cried Pansy.  "Too bad," said Dean Thomas. "You've got be, soul's gone."  Pansy turned, stretched begging hand toward Draco Malfoy's desk. "Draco!" said pleadingly. "Mr. Malfoy! Please, make Tracey give back soul!"  "I can't," said Tracey. "I ate it."  "Make throw up!" yelled Pansy.  The heir Malfoy slumped forward, resting head hands, nobody could see face. "Why life like this?" said Draco Malfoy.  A wild babble whispers started Tracey returned desk, smiling satisfaction, Pansy stood midst classroom, wringing hands tears starting eyes -  "Be. Quiet."  The soft, lethal voice seemed fill whole classroom Professor Snape stalked door. His face angrier Daphne ever seen it, sending jolt genuine fear spine. Hastily looked homework.  "Sit down, Parkinson," Potions Master hissed, "and you, Davis, take ridiculous cloak -"  "Professor Snaaaaaape!" wailed Pansy Parkinson tears. "Tracey ate sooouuul!"   Chapter 75: Self Actualization Final, Responsibility  It looping, meandering alley midst Hogwarts, wandering like stray lock hair; sometimes crossing itself, seemed, ever get end gave temptation apparent shortcuts.  At end tangle, six students leaned rough stones, robes black grey walls trimmed green, eyes darting one other. Torches burned windowless sconce, casting light ward darkness heat ward chill Slytherin dungeons.  "I certain," Reese Belka snapped, "absolutely certain, true ritual. Little firstie witches can't kind magic, even could, who's ever heard Dark ritual sacrifices sealed horror - that?"  "Were -" said Lucian Bole. "I mean - girl snapped fingers -"  Belka's glare melted him. "No," spat, "I not."  "That is, naked," drawled Marcus Flint, broad shoulders leaning back apparent relaxation lumpy stone surface. "Covered chocolate frosting, yes, naked."  "This day Potter offered great insult Houses," said grim voice Jaime Astorga.  "Yes, well, I'm sorry blunt," Randolph Lee said evenly. The seventh-year duelist rubbed chin, faint fuzz beard allowed grow. "But someone sticks ceiling, message, Astorga. It's message says: I'm incredibly powerful Dark Wizard could've done anything I damn well pleased, I care House offended, either."  Robert Jugson III gave soft, low laugh this, chuckle sent chills several spines. "It makes wonder picked wrong side, it? I've heard tales messages like that, sent old Dark Lord's bidding..."  "I'm ready kneel Potter yet," said Astorga, staring hard Jugson's eyes.  "Neither I," said Belka.  Jugson holding wand, turned idly back forth fingers, pointing downward. "Are Gryffindor Slytherin?" said Jugson. "Everyone's got price. Everyone smart."  This statement produced moment silence.  "Shouldn't Malfoy here?" Bole said tentatively.  Flint gave dismissive flick fingers. "Whatever Malfoy's plotting, wants put air innocence. He can't seen missing time us."  "But everyone knows already," said Bole. "Even Houses."  "Yes, clumsy," said Belka. She snorted. "Malfoy no, he's little firstie need here."  "I owl father," Jugson said softly, "and speak Lord Malfoy -" Abruptly, Jugson stopped speaking.  "I know you, dearies," Belka said fake sweetness, "but I plan running scared false ritual, I'm done Potter pet mudblood."  Nobody answered. All gazes looking past her.  Slowly, Belka turned around see others staring at.  "You nothing," hissed Head House. Severus Snape's face enraged, spoke small spots spittle flew mouth, dotting already-dirtied robes. "You fools done enough! You embarrassed House - lost first-years - speak embroiling noble Lords Wizengamot pathetic childish squabbles? I shall deal matter. You embarrass House again, risk embarrassing House again! You done fighting witches, I hear otherwise -"   If thought they'd sitting next dinnertime, that, quite mistaken.  "What want me?" came plaintive cry boy who, extensive reading scientific literature, still bit naive certain things. "Did want get beaten up?"  The upper-year Ravenclaw boys who'd sat next dinner-table exchanged swift glances until, unspoken protocol, experienced number spoke.  "Look," said Arty Grey, seventh-year leading competition three witches Defense Professor, "the thing got understand is, angry mean lost points. Miss Granger angry got frightened blamed, understand? But time, even though admit it, she'll touched boyfriend went ridiculous frankly insane lengths protect her."  "This points," ground Harry Potter, words visibly escaping clenched teeth. Dinner sat ignored table front him. "This justice. And I. Am. Not. Her. Boyfriend!"  This met certain amount sniggering present.  "Yeah, well," said sixth-year Ravenclaw boy, "I think kisses bring Dementation stick forty-four bullies ceiling her, we've gone way past 'she's girlfriend, really' question kids like. Wow, that's scary thought..." The Ravenclaw trailed said, smaller voice, "Please look like that."  "Look," said Arty Grey, "I'm sorry blunt this, justice girls, can't time." He clapped companionable hand Harry Potter's shoulder. "You've got potential, kid, potential wizard I've ever seen, got learn use it, know? Be bit sweeter them, learn spells clean mess call hair. Above all, need hide evilness better - well, better. Nice well-groomed boys get girls, Dark Wizards also get girls, nice well-groomed boys suspected secretly Dark get girls imagine -"  "Not interested," Harry said flatly, picked boy's hand shoulder unceremoniously dropped it.  "But be," said Arty Grey, voice low foreboding. "Ah, be!"  Elsewhere along table -  "Romantic?" shrieked Hermione Granger, loudly girls next winced. "What part romantic? He ask! He never asks! He sends ghosts people glues ceilings whatever wants life!"  "But see?" said fourth-year witch. "It means even though he's evil, loves you!"  "You're helping," said Penelope Clearwater little table, ignored. Several older witches started toward Hermione, she'd sat extreme opposite end table Harry Potter, swifter cloud younger girls surrounded Hermione impenetrable barrier.  "Boys," said Hermione Granger, "should allowed love girls without asking first! This true number ways especially comes gluing people ceiling!"  This also ignored. "It's like play!" sighed third-year girl.  "A play?" said Hermione. "I'd like see play anything like happens!"  "Oh," said third-year girl, "I thinking really romantic one there's nice, sweet boy makes Floo call, mispronounces destination stumbles room full Dark Wizards performing forbidden ritual stayed forever lost time, they're sacrificing seven victims order unseal ancient horror supposed grant someone wish freed, course boy's presence interrupts ritual, horror eating Dark Wizards everyone dying boy's last thought wishes could've girlfriend, next thing know boy lying lap beautiful woman whose eyes burning dreadful light, understand anything human boy always stop eating people. This like play, boy Harry Potter girl!"  "That..." Hermione said, feeling quite surprised. "That actually sound something like -"  "It does?" blurted second-year girl sitting across table, leaning forward, looking horrified yet even fascinated.  "No!" said Hermione. "I mean - he's boyfriend!"  Two seconds later, Hermione's ears caught lips said.  The fourth-year witch put hand Hermione's shoulder gave comforting squeeze. "Miss Granger," said soothing voice, "I think really honest yourself, admit real reason angry dark master channeled unspeakable powers Tracey Davis instead you."  Hermione's mouth opened throat locked words came out, probably good thing, she'd actually yelled loudly would've broken something.  "How's possible, actually?" said third-year girl. "I mean Harry Potter work another girl even though he's bound you? Do three one those, know, arrangements?"  "Gaaaaack," said Hermione Granger, throat still locked, brain halted, vocal cords spontaneously making noise like coughing yak.   (Later.)  "I understand unreasonable," said another second-year witch, who'd replaced third-year-girl Hermione threatened ask Tracey eat soul. "I mean, really, someone like Harry Potter rescued me, I'd - sending thank-you cards, hugging him, and," girl's face bit red, "well, kissing him, I'd hope."  "Yeah!" said second-year witch. "I've never understood girls plays get angry main character goes way nice them. I act like hero liked me."  Hermione Granger dropped head dinner table, hands slowly pulling hair.  "You understand male psychology," fourth-year witch said authoritative voice. "Granger's got make look like mysteriously resist seductive charm."   (Even later.)  And long Hermione Granger turned person left could talk to, person guaranteed understand point view -  "They're mad," said Hermione Granger strode vigorously toward Ravenclaw tower, left dinner bit early. "Everyone except me, Harry, I mean everyone except us whole school Hogwarts, they're entirely mad. And Ravenclaw girls worst, I know Ravenclaw girls go reading get older, I'm certain ought reading it. One witch asked two us soul-bonded, I'm going look library tonight, I'm pretty sure never actually happened -"  "I even know name kind fallacious reasoning," said Harry Potter. The boy walking normally, meant often skip forward steps match indignation-fueled speed. "I seriously think them, they'd dragging us minute get names changed Potter-Evans-Verres-Granger... Ugh, saying loud makes realize awful sounds."  "You mean name would Potter-Evans-Verres-Granger mine would Granger-Potter-Evans-Verres," said Hermione. "It's horrible imagine."  "No," said boy, "House Potter Noble House, I think name stays front -"  "What?" said indignantly. "Who says -"  There sudden awful silence, broken thuds shoes.  "Anyhow," Hermione said hastily, "some crazy things said dinner got thinking, I want say, Harry, I really grateful saving everybody getting beat up, even though parts afternoon upset me, I'm sure talk calmly."  "Ah..." Harry said faint tentative smile, eyes showing mixture befuddlement apprehension, "that's... good, I guess?"  To specific, there'd fourth-year witch explaining that, since Harry evil wizard who'd fallen love Hermione, Hermione pure innocent girl would either redeem get seduced Dark Arts herself, followed Hermione perpetually indignant anything Harry did, even heroically saving certain doom, romance resolve end Act IV. And Penelope Clearwater, Hermione really thought smarter that, remarked loud voice identical reasons impossible Hermione go talk sensibly Harry feeling hurt, anyway Dark Wizards attracted passionate defiance woman, logic. This point Hermione shoved benches, stomped furiously Harry sitting, asked reasonable voice two could go walk sort things out.  "So words," Hermione said calmest voice ever, "you're really trouble me, I'm still talking you, we're still friends, we're still studying together. We're fight. Right?"  Somehow seemed increase Harry Potter's apprehension. "Right," said Boy-Who-Lived.  "Great!" said Hermione. "So, worked I upset, Mr. Potter?"  There pause. "You wanted keep affairs?" Harry said cautiously. "I mean - I know wanted things own. And I staying way, I'd heard gotten ambushed three junior Death Eaters and, honestly, I expecting that. Professor Quirrell expecting that. I started worry gotten head then, offense Hermione, forty-four bullies massed ambush way beyond anyone could handle without help. That's I thought really needed help -"  "No, part's fine," said Hermione. "We heads, honestly. Please guess again, Mr. Potter."  "Um," said Harry. "What Tracey did... startled you?"  "Startled me, Mr. Potter?" There might touch acidity voice. "No, Mr. Potter, I scared. I frightened. I want admit afraid dragons something, people might think I cowardly, hear distant voices crying 'Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li!' there's pools blood seeping doors, okay scared."  "I sorry," Harry said sounded like genuine regret. "I thought realize me."  "And reason got scared like that, Mr. Potter, ask first!" Despite intentions, Hermione found voice rising again. "You asked something like that, Harry! You said specifically, 'Hermione, I make blood come doors?' It's important specific asking sort thing!"  The boy rubbed back neck walked. "I... honestly, I thought say no."  "Yes, Mr. Potter, I could've said no. That's whole point asking first, Mr. Potter!"  "No, I mean say no, whether really wanted. And would've gotten beaten would've fault asking first."  Hermione's eyebrows went bit surprise, kept walking steps tried understand this. "What?" said.  "Well..." boy said bit slowly. "I mean... Sunshine General, you? You say yes scaring people, even bullies, even save friends getting beaten up. You would've say no, would've gotten hurt. This way, tell people honestly idea fault. That's I warn you."  Hermione stopped walking, turned face Harry full instead turning head. Her voice carefully even said, "Harry, got stop coming clever reasons stupid things."  Harry's eyebrows flew up. After moment said, "Look... I know mean, course, there's still question whether actually good idea, clever one -"  "I understand did today," Hermione said. "But I want promise on, ask first, always, even come reason shouldn't."  There pause stretched, Hermione could feel heart sinking.  "Hermione -" Harry started say.  "Why?" The frustration burst voice. "Why awful? All ask!"  Harry's eyes serious. "Who S.P.H.E.W. try hardest defend, Hermione? Who afraid for, fight?"  "Hannah Abbott," Hermione said without think it, felt little bad, Hannah trying hard improved lot -  "Would feel okay trusting someone else, like Tracey, final responsibility protecting Hannah? If knew Hannah walk ambush, came plan protecting her, would feel good letting Tracey say whether allowed it?"  "Well... no?" said Hermione, puzzled.  The green eyes Boy-Who-Lived steady hers. "Would trust Hannah final say whether needed protecting?"  "I -" said Hermione, paused. It strange, knew right answer also knew right answer actually true. Hannah trying hard prove afraid, even though was, easy see Hufflepuff girl might try hard -  Then Hermione realized implication. "You think I'm like Hannah?"  "Not... exactly..." Harry ran hands mess hair. "Listen, Hermione, would suggested doing, I'd warned ambush forty-four bullies?"  "I would've done responsible thing told Professor McGonagall let take care it," Hermione said promptly. "And darkness people screaming horrible blue light -"  But Harry shook head. "That's responsible thing do, Hermione. It's someone playing role responsible girl would do. Yes, I thought going Professor McGonagall. But would've stopped disaster once. Probably disturbance happened first place, like telling bullies knew. If bullies got punished plotting, would losing House points, worst day's detention, anything would really scare them. And bullies would tried again. Fewer them, better operational security I hear it. They would probably ambush one you, alone. Professor McGonagall authority something scary enough protect - overstepped authority, really responsible."  "Professor McGonagall responsible?" Hermione said incredulously. She jammed hands hips, openly glaring him. "Are nuts?"  The boy blink. "You could call heroic responsibility, maybe," Harry Potter said. "Not like usual sort. It means whatever happens, matter what, always fault. Even tell Professor McGonagall, responsible happens, are. Following school rules excuse, someone else charge excuse, even trying best excuse. There excuses, got get job done matter what." Harry's face tightened. "That's I say thinking responsibly, Hermione. Thinking job done tell Professor McGonagall - heroine thinking. Like Hannah beat okay then, fault anymore. Being heroine means job finished done whatever takes protect girls, permanently." In Harry's voice touch steel acquired since day Fawkes shoulder. "You can't think following rules means done duty."  "I think," Hermione said evenly, "that I might disagree things, Mr. Potter. Like whether Professor McGonagall responsible, whether responsible usually involves people running around screaming, much good idea follow school rules. And disagree, Mr. Potter, mean get final say."  "Well," said Harry, "you asked awful ask first, surprisingly good question, I examined mind that's I found. I think real fear Hannah trouble I come way save seems weird dark something, might weigh consequences Hannah. You might accept heroine's responsibility coming way save her, somehow, matter what. Instead carry role Hermione Granger, sensible Ravenclaw girl; role Hermione Granger automatically says no, whether better plan mind. And forty-four bullies take turns beating Hannah Abbott, it'll fault I knew, even I want reality way, I knew would go. I'm pretty sure secret, wordless, unutterable fear."  The frustration building inside again. "It's life!" Hermione burst out. She could imagine would like Harry messing time, constantly inventing justifications ask first listen objections. She win argument - "There'll always reason, always say I'm thinking right! I want life! Otherwise I'll walk away, I really will, I mean Harry."  Harry sighed. "This exactly I want things end up, are. You're afraid thing I am, you? Afraid let go steering wheel, we'll crash." The corners lips twisted, look like real smile. "That's something I understand."  "I think understand all!" Hermione said sharply. "You said we'd partners, Harry!"  That stopped him, could see stop him.  "How this?" Harry said last. "I'll promise ask first I anything could interpreted meddling affairs. Only got promise reasonable, Hermione. I mean really, genuinely, stop think twenty seconds first, treat real choice. The sort reasonableness realize I'm offering way protect girls, automatically say without considering properly, there's actual consequence Hannah Abbott ends hospital."  Hermione stared Harry, recitation wound down.  "Well?" said Harry.  "I make promises," said, "just consulted life." She turned Harry began walking toward Ravenclaw tower, looking him. "But I'll think it, anyway."  She heard Harry sigh, walked silence while, passing archway reddish metal like copper, corridor like one they'd left except tiled pentagons instead squares.  "Hermione..." said Harry. "I've watching thinking, since day said going hero. You've got courage. You'll fight what's right, even face enemies would scare people away. You've certainly got raw intelligence it, probably better person inside I am. But even so... well, honest, Hermione... I can't quite see filling Dumbledore's shoes, leading magical Britain's fight You-Know-Who. Not yet, anyway."  Hermione turned head stare Harry, went walking, though lost thought. Fill shoes? She'd never tried imagine way. She'd never imagined imagining way.  "And maybe I'm wrong," Harry said walked. "Maybe I've read many stories heroes never sensible thing follow rules tell Professor McGonagalls, brain think proper storybook hero. Maybe who's sane one, Hermione, who's silly. But every time talk following rules relying teachers, I get feeling, like bound one last thing that's stopping you, one last thing puts PC self sleep turns NPC again..." Harry let sigh. "Maybe that's Dumbledore said I wicked stepparents."  "He said what?"  Harry nodded. "I still know whether Headmaster joking or... thing is, right way. I loving parents, I never felt like I could trust decisions, sane enough. I always knew I think things myself, I might get hurt. Professor McGonagall whatever takes get job done I'm nag it, break rules without heroic supervision. Professor Quirrell really someone gets things done matter what, he's person I know notices stuff like Snitch ruining Quidditch. But I can't trust good. Even sad, I think that's part environment creates Dumbledore calls hero - people anyone else shove final responsibility onto, that's form mental habit tracking everything themselves."     Hermione say anything that, thinking back something Godric Gryffindor written near end short autobiography. Briefly without explanation, scroll meant copied hand, centuries Muggle printing press inspired wizards invent Reading-Writing Quill.  No rescuer hath rescuer, Godric Gryffindor written. No Lord hath champion, mother father, nothingness above.  If price hero, Hermione sure wanted pay it. Or maybe - though sort thing would thought, started hanging around Harry - maybe Godric Gryffindor gotten wrong.  "Do trust Dumbledore?" Hermione said. "I mean, he's right school he's legendary hero whole world -"  "He legendary hero," said Harry. "Now sets chickens fire. Honestly, Dumbledore seem reliable you?"  Hermione answer.  Side side, two began climb huge wide spiral stairs, steps alternating bronze metal blue stone; final approach Ravenclaw portrait waited guard dorm silly riddles.  "Oh, I thought something I tell you," Harry said halfway up. "Since affects life all. Think sort payment -"  "What it?" said Hermione.  "I predict S.P.H.E.W. retire."  "Retire?" Hermione said, almost stumbling one stairs.  "Yeah," Harry said. "I mean, I could wrong, I suspect teachers clamp hard fighting corridors." Harry grinning spoke, glint eyes behind glasses hinting secret knowledge. "Cast new wards detect offensive hexes, start verifying reports bullying using Veritaserum - I think several ways might shut down. But I'm right, something celebrate, Hermione, you. You kicked enough public ruckus got actually something bullying. All bullying."  Slowly, then, smile began creep lips, reached top stairs began walking toward Ravenclaw portrait riddle, Hermione felt rather lighter feet, wonderful lifting feeling spreading like she'd pumped full helium.  Somehow, despite effort eight put in, expected much, expected actually work.  They'd made difference...   It end breakfast-time next morning.  The students every year sat still benches, heads turned direction, toward Head Table, one lone first-year girl stood rigid motionless, head tilted back stare Head House Slytherin.  Professor Snape's face twisted fury triumph, vindictive painting Dark Wizard; behind Professors sat Head Table, watching faces though carved stone.  "- permanently disbanded," spat Potions Master. "Your self-proclaimed Society outlawed within Hogwarts, decision Professor! If Society member discovered fighting hallways again, Granger, personally held responsible expelled, me, Hogwarts School Witchcraft Wizardry!"  That first-year girl stood there, Head Table she'd called receive commendations smiles; stood spine held tall upright curve like centaur's bow, giving nothing enemy.  That first-year witch stood tears anger bottled, face still, nothing changing outward appearance, something slowly broke inside her, could feel breaking.  It broke Professor Snape gave two weeks detention crime violence school, sneering contemptuous face he'd shown first day Potions, little twist corner smile said Potions Master knew exactly unfair being.  Whatever-it-was inside cracked way through, top bottom, Professor Snape took one hundred points Ravenclaw.  It ended, then, Snape told dismissed.  She turned around saw Ravenclaw table, Harry Potter sitting still place, see expression here, saw fists table see clenched white like own. She whispered him, Professor Snape called her, anything without asking first.  Hermione wheeled back look Head Table, Snape turning away resume place.  "I said dismissed, girl," said sneering voice, pleased smile Snape's face, like waiting something -  Hermione strode forward another five steps toward Head Table said breaking voice, "Headmaster?"  Utter silence filled Great Hall.  Headmaster Dumbledore said nothing, move. It though he, too, carved stone.  Hermione turned gaze look Professor Flitwick, whose head, barely visible table, seemed staring lap. Beside him, Professor Sprout's face tight, seemed forcing watch, lips trembling, said nothing.  Professor McGonagall's chair empty, Deputy Headmistress shown breakfast morning.  "Why saying anything?" said Hermione Granger. Her voice trembling last hope, last desperate reach help place inside her. "You know he's wrong!"  "Two weeks' detention, insolence," Snape said silkily.  It shattered.  She looked Head Table seconds longer, Professor Flitwick Professor Sprout empty place Professor McGonagall been. Then Hermione Granger turned began walking toward Ravenclaw table.  There babble voices starting up, students came unfrozen they'd sat.  And then, almost Ravenclaw table -  The dry voice Professor Quirrell cut everything, voice said, "One hundred points Miss Granger right."  Hermione almost fell feet; continued forward, even Snape shouted something furious, even Professor Quirrell leaned back chair began laugh, even Dumbledore's voice saying something catch sitting Ravenclaw table next Harry Potter.  Harry Potter frozen beside her, looked like someone dare move.  "It's right," voice said him, automatically without choice thought involved, although really right all. "But see get Snape's detentions, like time?"  Harry Potter nodded, single jerky motion head. "I -" said Harry. "I - I'm sorry, - fault -"  "Don't ridiculous, Harry." It odd voice coming normal, without thinking say. Hermione looked breakfast plate, eating seemed clearly question, roiling churning stomach suggested already verge throwing up, odd could sworn whole body felt numb, like feeling anything, time.  "And," voice said, "if want break school rules something, ask it, I promise I say no."

She came empty rock cavern pierced many dark openings, lit torch ancient style fired entered.  There one else there, yet, long minutes nervous standing, began spell Transfigure cushioned sofa large enough two people sit, maybe even lie on. A simple wooden stool would easier, could done fifteen seconds, - well -  Even sofa fully conjured, Professor Snape still arrived, sat left side sofa pulse hammering throat. Somehow becoming nervous, less, delay stretched.  She knew last time.  The last time memories went away, Rianne Felthorne found mysterious cavern, wondering going on.  There something felt like dying.  The books said properly done Obliviation harmful, people forgot things time. People dreamed, woke without remembering dreams. Obliviation even involve much discontinuity, brief instant disorientation; like distracted loud noise losing track thought seem remember afterward.

When looked ahead future, nobody complete thoughts finished thinking. Even managed tie loose ends mind next minute, anything left afterward. Wasn't exactly would find reflecting on, going die next minute?  There came sound muffled steps...  Severus Snape emerged cavern.  His eyes moved sitting sofa, strange expression crossed face; strange sardonic, angry, cold.  "Thank you, Miss Felthorne," Snape said quietly, "that considerate you." The Potions Master took wand performed usual privacy Charms, moved toward her, sat heavily beside Transfigured sofa.  Her pulse pounding another reason entirely.  She slowly turned look Professor Snape, saw head leaning back sofa, eyes closed. Not sleeping, though. His face appeared tense, unrelaxed, bearing pain.  She knew - suddenly certain - allowed see sight remember afterward; nobody ever allowed see it.  The frantic conversation going inside Rianne Felthorne's mind sounded something like this: I could lean kiss him, completely tiny mind, eyes closed I bet stop time, I bet would years anyone found body -  But Professor Snape opened eyes (to inner disappointment relief), said, normal voice, "Your payment, Miss Felthorne." From robe took ruby, cut Gringotts standard, held toward her. "Fifty facets. I mind count them."  She held trembling hand, hoping Snape would press ruby fingers, would feel touch skin alive -  But instead Snape raised hand slightly dropped ruby hand, leaned back couch. "You remember finding lying ground cavern, came exploring," said Snape. "And since nobody except actually believe that, remember thinking would less troublesome deposited money separate box Gringotts."  For stretch faint crackling torch.  "Why -" Rianne Felthorne said. He knows I remember. "Why it? I mean - said tell bullies would be, would be, whether Granger would there. And I know, way Time-Turner works, want make Granger there, can't told whether already happened. So I work ones telling go. We were, we?"  Snape nodded without speaking. He closed eyes again.  "But," said Rianne, "I understand helping her. And - Granger Great Hall - I understand all." Rianne never thought particularly nice. She'd taken little notice controversy Sunshine General. But something helping Granger fight bullies had... well, she'd gotten used thinking good side, thinking good side. And she'd found actually liked it. It hard, let go. "Why'd that, Professor Snape?"  Snape shook head, face tightened.  "Is -" Rianne said falteringly. "I mean - long we're - anything want talk about?" There something wanted say, make words pass lips.  "I think one matter," Snape said pause. "If interested, Miss Felthorne."  Snape's eyes still shut, nod head. Her voice almost broke, forced say "Yes."  "There's certain boy class likes you, Miss Felthorne," Snape said behind closed eyes. "I say name. But watches every time walk across room, thinks looking. He dreams desires possess you, he's never asked much kiss."  Her heart started hammering even harder.  "Please tell honest truth, Miss Felthorne. What think boy?"  "Well -" said. She stumbling words. "I think - never even ask one kiss - would -"  Sad.  Just pitiful.  "Weakness," said, voice trembling.  "I agree," said Snape. "Suppose boy helped you, though. Would think owed kiss, asked?"  She inhaled sharply -  "Or would think," Snape continued, eyes still closed, "that bothersome?"  The words stabbed like knife help gasping loud.  Snape's eyes flew open, gaze met across sofa.  Then Potions Master began laugh, small sad chuckles.  "No, you, Miss Felthorne!" Snape said. "Not you! We really talking boy. One attends Potions class, fact."  "Oh," said. She tried remember Snape said before, feeling rather unnerved thought boy watching her, always silently watching. "Well, um, case. That's kind creepy, actually. Who it?"  The Potions Master shook head. "It matter," said Snape. "Out curiosity, would think boy still love years later?"  "Um," said, feeling bit confused, "that would totally pathetic?"  The torch crackled bit cavern.  "It's strange," Snape said quietly. "I two mentors, course days. Both extraordinarily perceptive, neither one ever told things I seeing. It's clear enough first said nothing, second..." Snape's face tightened. "I suppose I would naive, ask stayed silent."  The quiet stretched, Rianne tried frantically think something say.  "It odd thing," Snape said, voice still softer, "to look back thirty-two years, wonder life ruined past rescuing. Was determined Sorting Hat cried 'Slytherin!' me? It seems unfair, since I offered choice; Sorting Hat spoke moment touched upon head. Yet I cannot claim named untruly. I never treasured knowledge sake. I loyal one person I called friend. I never one righteous fury, now. Courage? There bravery risking life already ruined. My little fears always mastered me, I never turned aside paths I walked down, little fears. No, Sorting Hat could never put House. Perhaps final loss determined, even then. Is fair, I ask, even Sorting Hat speaks truly? Is fair children possess courage others, thus man's life judged?"  Rianne Felthorne starting realize she'd never tiniest inkling Potions Master inside, unfortunately dark hidden depths helping problem.  "But no," Snape said. "I know went wrong last time. I could point day hour I missed final chance. Miss Felthorne, Sorting Hat offer Ravenclaw?"  "Y-yes," said without thinking.  "Have ever good riddles?"  "Yes," said again, whatever Professor Snape say, hear said no.  "I terrible riddles," Snape said distant voice. "I given riddle solve, I understand even simplest part late. I even realize riddle meant late. I thought I merely happened overhear it, truth I overheard. So I sold riddle another, wreckage life passed beyond retrieval." Snape's voice still distant, sounding abstracted sorrowful. "And even now, I understand nothing importance. Tell me, Miss Felthorne, suppose man carrying knife, tripped baby stabbed himself. Would say baby had," Snape's voice lowered, though imitating still deeper voice, "THE POWER TO VANQUISH him?"  "Um... no?" said hesitantly.  "Then mean power vanquish someone?"  Rianne considered puzzle. (Wishing, first time life, chosen Ravenclaw perdition parents' disapproval; Sorting Hat never offered Gryffindor.) "Well..." Rianne said. She trouble putting thoughts words. "It means got power, it. It means could tried -"  "Choice," Potions Master said faraway voice, though really talking all. "There choice. That riddle seems imply. And choice foregone conclusion chooser, riddle say, vanquish, rather power vanquish. How would grown man mark baby equal?"  "What?" said Rianne. She understand all.  "Marking baby simple. Any strong Dark curse would produce lasting scar. But may done child. What mark would signify baby equal?"  She answered first thought came mind. "If signed betrothal contract, would mean equals someday, grew got married."  "That..." said Snape. "That's probably it, Miss Felthorne, thank trying." The long delicate fingers, honed stirring potions unimaginably fine tolerances, reached rubbed temples man's forehead. "It enough drive madness, much hinging fragile words. Power knows not... must unknown spell. Not something could acquire simply practice study. Some innate talent? No one learn Metamorphmagus... yet hardly seems like power knows not. Nor I see either could destroy remnant other; I see one direction, reverse..." The Potions Master sighed. "And none means anything you, it, Miss Felthorne? The words nothing. The words shadows. It intonation carries meaning something I've never able to..."  The Potions Master trailed off, Rianne stared him.  "A prophecy?" Rianne said high squeak. "You heard prophecy?" She'd taken Divination couple months dropping disgust, knew much worked.  "I try one last thing," said Snape. "Something I tried before. Miss Felthorne, listen sound voice, way I say it, words themselves, tell think means. Can that? Good," said Snape, nodded obediently, though sure supposed do.  And Severus Snape drew breath, intoned, "FOR THOSE TWO DIFFERENT SPELLETS CANNOT EXIST IN THE SAME VULD."  It sent shivers spine, worse knowing hollow words spoken imitation true prophecy. Unnerved, blurted first thing came mind, might influenced present company. "Those two different ingredients cannot exist cauldron?"  "But not, Miss Felthorne? What meaning statement like that? What really told?"  "Ah..." hazarded. "If two ingredients mix, they'll catch fire burn cauldron?"  Snape's face change expression slightest.  "Perhaps," Snape finally said, they'd sat sofa awful silence seemed like minutes. "It would explain word must. Thank you, Miss Felthorne. Once helpful."  "I -" said, "I glad -" words stuck throat. The Potions Master thanked tone finality, knew time Rianne Felthorne remembered moments drawing end. "I wish I forget this, Professor Snape!"  "I wish," Severus Snape said whisper low could hardly hear it, "that everything different..."  The Potions Master stood sofa, weight presence vanishing beside her. He turned drew wand robes, pointing her.  "Wait -" said. "Before -"  Somehow unbelievably hard take first step fantasy reality, imagining doing. Even one step would never go further. The gap stretched like distance two mountains.  The Sorting Hat never offered Gryffindor...  ...was fair thus woman's life judged?  If can't say now, even remember afterward - nothing continue moment, die - ever say it, anyone?  "Can I kiss first?" said Rianne Felthorne.  Snape's black eyes studied intensely blush started reach way chest, wondered knew perfectly well still weak, kiss she'd truly wanted.  "Why not," Potions Master said quietly, leaned head sofa kissed her.  It nothing like she'd imagined. In fantasies Snape's kisses fierce, seized her, - awkward, actually. Snape's lips pressed hard hers, forcing back teeth, angle right noses sort bending lips tight -  Only Potions Master straightened back again, raising wand more, realize.  "That -" said wondering voice, looking him. "That - - first -"  Rianne Felthorne blinked stone cavern she'd discovered, still holding extraordinary ruby she'd found embedded dirt one corner. It incredible windfall, know looking ruby made feel sad, like she'd forgotten something, something precious her.   Chapter 77: SA, Aftermaths: Surface Appearances  Aftermath: Albus Dumbledore -  The old wizard sat alone desk, unsilence Headmaster's office, amid innumerable unnoticed devices; robes gentle yellow, soft fabric, clothing ordinarily wore others. His wrinkled hand held quill scratching away official-looking parchment. If somehow watch lined face, would unable deduce anything man understood enigmatic devices. You might observed face looked little sad, little tired, Albus Dumbledore always looked like alone.  In Floo hearth scattered ashes without hint flame, magical door shut solidly stop existing. On material plane, great oaken door office closed locked; beyond door, Endless Stairs stayed motionless; bottom stairs, gargoyles blocked entrance flow, pseudo-life withdrawn leave solid rock.  Then, even quill middle penning word, even middle scratching letter -  The old wizard shot feet speed would shocked anyone watching, abandoning quill mid-letter fall onto parchment; like lightning spun oaken door, yellow robes whirling around wand dread power leaping hand -  And abruptly, old wizard paused, halting motion even wand came bear.  A hand struck upon oaken door, three times knocking.  More slowly, now, grim wand went back dueling holster strapped beneath old wizard's sleeve. The ancient man moved forward paces, drew formal stance, composed face. Nearby upon desk, quill moved side parchment, though carefully placed rather dropped haste; parchment flipped show blankness.  With silent twitch will, oaken door swung open.  Hard stones, green eyes glared him.  "I admit I impressed, Harry," old wizard said quietly. "The Cloak Invisibility would let evade lesser means vision; I sense golems step aside, stairs turning. How come here?"  The boy walked office, step deliberate step door closed smoothly behind him. "I go anywhere I choose, without permission," boy said. His voice seemed calm; calm, perhaps. "I office I decided here, hell passwords. You greatly mistaken, Headmaster Dumbledore, think I stay school I prisoner here. I simply chosen, yet, leave. Now keeping mind, command agent, Professor Snape, break agreement made office, would torment student fourth year below?"  The old wizard looked angry young hero long moment. Then, slowly enough alarm boy, wizened fingers drew open one manifold drawers desk, lifted sheet parchment, laid upon desk. "Fourteen," old wizard said. "It number owls sent last night. Only owls sent families seat Wizengamot, families great wealth, families already allied foes. Or, case Robert Jugson, three; father, Lord Jugson, Death Eater, grandfather Death Eater died Alastor Moody's wand. What letters said, I know, I guess. Do still understand, Harry Potter? Each time Hermione Granger won, put it, danger Slytherin grew again, yet again. But Slytherins triumphed her, easily safely, without violence lasting harm. They won, need fight more..." The old wizard sighed. "So I planned. So I hoped. So would been, Defense Professor taken upon intervene. Now dispute goes Board Governors, Severus seem conquer Defense Professor; feel Slytherins, finished moment, satisfaction."  The boy advanced room, head tilting back look half-moon glasses; somehow like boy looking Headmaster, rather up. "So Lord Jugson Death Eater?" boy said softly. "Good. His life already bought paid for, then, I anything I want without ethical problems -"  "Harry!"  The boy's voice clear ice, frozen purest water untouched spring. "You seem think Light live fear darkness. I say way around. I'd prefer kill Lord Jugson, even Death Eater. But one hour brainstorming Defense Professor would plenty time come creative way wreck financially, get exiled magical Britain. That would serve make point, I think."  "I confess," old wizard said slowly, "that thought ruining five-hundred-year-old House, challenging Death Eater war finish, scuffle Hogwarts hallway, occurred me, Harry." The old wizard lifted finger push back half-moon glasses slid little nose, sudden motion earlier. "I daresay would occur Miss Granger either, Professor McGonagall, Fred George."  The boy shrugged. "It hallways," boy said. "It would justice past crimes, I'd Jugson made first move. The point make people scared wild card, all. It's teach neutrals perfectly safe me, poking stick incredibly dangerous." The boy smiled way reach eyes. "Maybe I'll buy ad Daily Prophet, saying anyone wants carry dispute learn true meaning Chaos, anyone leaves alone fine."  "No," old wizard said. His voice deeper now, showing something true age power. "No, Harry, must be. You yet learned meaning fighting, truly happens foes meet battle. And dream, young boys do, teaching foes fear you. It frightens you, far young age, might already enough power make part dreams reality. There turning road lead darkness, Harry, none. That way Dark Lord, certain."  The boy hesitated, then, eyes flickered empty golden platform Fawkes sometimes rested wings. It gesture would caught, old wizard knew well.  "All right, forget part teaching fear me," boy said then. His voice less hard, cold gone it. "I still think let children get hurt fear someone like Lord Jugson might do. Protecting whole point job. If Lord Jugson really try get way, whatever takes stop him. Give full access vaults, I'll take personal responsibility dealing fallout banning bullies Hogwarts, whether Lord Jugson anyone else."  Slowly old wizard shook head. "You seem think, Harry, I need merely use full power, foes swept aside. You wrong. Lucius Malfoy controls Minister Fudge, Daily Prophet sways Britain, bare margins control enough Board Governors oust Hogwarts. Amelia Bones Bartemius Crouch allies, even would step aside saw us acting wantonly. The world surrounds fragile seem believe, must walk greater care. The old Wizarding War never ended, Harry, continued different form; black king slept, Lucius Malfoy moved chesspieces time. Do think Lucius Malfoy would lightly permit take pawn color?"  The boy smiled, touch coldness again. "Okay, I'll figure way set looks like Lord Jugson betrayed side."  "Harry -"  "Obstacles mean get creative, Headmaster. It mean abandon children supposed protect. Let Light win, trouble comes -" The boy shrugged. "Let Light win again."  "So might phoenixes speak, words," old wizard said. "But understand phoenix's price."  The last two words spoken peculiarly clear voice seemed echo around office, huge rumbling noise seemed come around them.  Between ancient shield wall Sorting Hat's hatrack, stone walls began flow move, pouring two framing columns revealing gap them, opening showed set stone stairs leading upward darkness.  The old wizard turned strode toward stairs, looked back Harry Potter stood. "Come!" said old wizard. There twinkle blue eyes. "Since already gone far force way uninvited, may well go further."   There railings stone steps, first steps Harry drew wand cast Lumos. The Headmaster look back, seem looking downward, though climbed steps often enough need vision.  The boy knew curious, frightened, spare brain capacity that. It taking control let fury simmering inside boil already had.  The stairs went short distance, one straight rising flight without turns curves.  At top door solid metal, looking black blue light cast Harry's wand, meaning metal either black perhaps red.  Albus Dumbledore lifted long wand like brandished symbol, spoke strange voice seemed echo Harry's ears, though burning memory: "Phoenix's fate."  That last door opened, Harry followed Dumbledore inside.  The room beyond seemed made black metal like door led it. The walls black, floor black. The ceiling black, single globe crystal hung ceiling white chain, shone brilliant silver light looked like cast imitation Patronus light, though could tell real thing.  Within room pedestals black metal, bearing moving picture, upright cylinder half-filled faintly shining silver liquid, lone small object; scorched silver necklace, crushed hat, untouched golden wedding ring. Many pedestals bore three, moving picture silver liquid item. There seemed good many wizards' wands upon pedestals, many wands broken, burned, looked like wood somehow melted.  It took long Harry realize seeing, throat suddenly choked; like rage inside hit hammerblow, maybe hardest hammerblow entire existence.  "These fallen wars," Albus Dumbledore said. His back Harry, grey locks yellowish robes showed. "Not even nearly them. Only closest friends, died worst decisions, something here. Those I regret all, place."  Harry count many pedestals room. It might around hundred. The room black metal small, clearly space left future pedestals.  Albus Dumbledore turned regarded Harry, deep blue eyes set like steel brow, voice, spoke, calm. "It seems know nothing phoenix's price," Albus Dumbledore said quietly. "It seems evil person, terribly ignorant, confident ignorance; I was, long time ago. Yet I never heard Fawkes clearly seemed to, day. Perhaps I already old full grief, phoenix came me. If something I understand, ready I fight, tell wisdom." There anger old wizard's voice; impact drove breath like falling broomstick scorched shattered wands, gleaming gently death beneath silver light. "Or else turn go place, I wish hear it."  Harry know say. There nothing life like this, words seemed fall away. He would find something say looked, believe, moment, words would meaningful. You able win possible argument, people died decisions, yet even knowing felt like nothing said. That nothing Harry right say.  And Harry almost turn go place, except understanding came then: probably part Albus Dumbledore always stood place, always, matter was. And stood place like could anything, lose anything, meant fight another time.  One pedestals caught Harry's eye; photograph move, smile wave, Muggle photograph woman looking seriously camera, brown hair twisted braids ordinary Muggle style Harry seen witch. There cylinder silvery liquid beside photograph, object; melted ring broken wand.  Harry walked forward, slowly, stood pedestal. "Who she?" Harry said, voice sounding strange ears.  "Her name Tricia Glasswell," said Dumbledore. "The mother Muggleborn daughter, Death Eaters killed. She detective Muggle government, fed information Muggle authorities Order Phoenix, - betrayed - hands Voldemort." There catch old wizard's voice. "She die well, Harry."  "Did save lives?" Harry said.  "Yes," wizard said quietly. "She did."  Harry lifted gaze pedestal look Dumbledore. "Would world better place fought?"  "No, would not," said old wizard. His voice tired, grieving. He seemed bent now, though folding himself. "I see still understand. I think understand day - oh, Harry. So long ago, I much older now, I learned true face violence, cost. To fill air deadly curses - reason - reason, Harry - ill thing, nature corrupted, terrible darkest rituals. Violence, begun, becomes like Lethifold strikes life near it. I... would spare lesson way I learned it, Harry."  Harry looked away blue eyes, cast gaze black metal floor. The Headmaster trying tell something important, clear; something Harry thought stupid, either.  "There Muggle named Mohandas Gandhi," Harry said floor. "He thought government Muggle Britain rule country. And refused fight. He convinced whole country fight. Instead told people walk British soldiers let struck down, without resisting, Britain stand more, freed country. I thought beautiful thing, I read it, I thought something higher wars anyone ever fought guns swords. That they'd really done that, actually worked." Harry drew another breath. "Only I found Gandhi told people, World War II, Nazis invaded use nonviolent resistance them, too. But Nazis would've shot everyone sight. And maybe Winston Churchill always felt better way, clever way win without hurt anyone; never found it, fight." Harry looked Headmaster, staring him. "Winston Churchill one tried convince British government give Czechoslovakia Hitler exchange peace treaty, fight right away -"  "I recognize name, Harry," said Dumbledore. The old wizard's lips twitched upward. "Although honesty compels say dear Winston never one pangs conscience, even dozen shots Firewhiskey."  "The point is," Harry said, brief pause remember exactly talking to, fight suddenly returning sense ignorant child gone insane audacity right room right question Albus Dumbledore anything, "the point is, saying violence evil answer. It say fight fight. It's hard question Gandhi refused deal it, that's I lost respect him."  "And answer, Harry?" Dumbledore said quietly.  "One answer ever use violence except stop violence," Harry said. "You risk anyone's life except save even lives. It sounds good say like that. Only problem police officer sees burglar robbing house, police officer try stop burglar, even though burglar might fight back someone might get hurt even killed. Even burglar trying steal jewelry, thing. Because nobody much inconveniences burglars, burglars, burglars. And even ever stole things time, would - fabric society -" Harry stopped. His thoughts ordered usually pretended be, room. He able give perfectly logical exposition terms game theory, least able see way, eluding him. Hawks doves - "Don't see, evil people willing risk violence get want, good people always back violence terrible risk, - good society live in, Headmaster! Don't realize bullying Hogwarts, Slytherin House all?"  "War terrible risk," old wizard said. "And yet come. Voldemort returning. The black chesspieces gathering. Severus one important pieces side possesses, war. But evil Potions Master must, saying goes, keep appearances. If Severus pay keep hurting feelings children, feelings, Harry," old wizard's voice soft, "you would terribly innocent ways war, think made poor bargain. Hard decisions look like that, Harry. They look - like this." The old wizard gesture. He simply stood was, among pedestals.  "You Headmaster," Harry said burning throat. "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, try school principal run war time. Hogwarts part this."  "The children survive," old wizard said tired old eyes. "They would survive Voldemort. Have wondered children Hogwarts speak much parents, Harry? It always, within earshot, someone lost mother father both. That Voldemort left behind, last time came. Nothing worth war beginning even one day earlier must, lasting one day longer must." The old wizard gesture now, though indicate shattered wands. "We fight seemed righteous so! We fought to, way left. That answer."  "Is waited long confront Grindelwald?"  Harry uttered question without quite thinking -  There slow time blue eyes searched him.  "Who talking to, Harry?" said old wizard. "No, answer. I already know." Dumbledore sighed. "Many asked question, always I turned aside. Yet time must learn full truth matter. Will swear never speak another, I give leave?"  Harry would liked allowed tell Draco, - "I swear," Harry said.  "Grindelwald possessed ancient terrible device," said Dumbledore. "While held it, I could break defense. In duel I could win, fight long hours fell exhaustion; I would died afterward, Fawkes. But Muggle allies yet made blood sacrifice sustain him, Grindelwald would fallen. He was, time, truly invincible. Of grim device Grindelwald held, none must know, none must suspect, must single hint. And therefore must speak it, I say now. That all, Harry. There moral it, wisdom. That is."  Harry slowly nodded. It entirely implausible, standards magic...  "And then," Dumbledore's voice went on, even quieter, almost though speaking himself, "since I felled him, obeyed I said die, though cried thousands blood. So imprisoned Nurmengard, prison built, abides day. I went duel without intent kill him, Harry. Because, see, I tried kill Grindelwald before, long time ago, that... was... proved be... mistake, Harry..." The old wizard staring long dark-grey wand held hands, though crystal ball Muggle fantasy, scrying pool within answers could found. "And I thought, then... I thought I never kill. And came Voldemort."  The old wizard looked back Harry, said, hoarse voice, "He like Grindelwald, Harry. There nothing human left him. Him must destroy. You must hesitate, time comes. To alone, creatures world, must show mercy; done must forget it, forget ever thing, go back living. Save fury that, alone."  In office silence.  It lasted many long seconds, finally broken single question.  "Are Dementors Nurmengard?"  "What?" said old wizard. "No! I would done even -"   The old wizard stared young boy, straightened, face changed.  "In words," boy said, though talking without people room, "it's already known keep powerful Dark Wizards prison, without using Dementors. People know know that."  "Harry...?"  "No," boy said. The boy looked up, eyes blazing like green fire. "I accept answer, Headmaster. Fawkes gave mission, I know Fawkes gave mission me, you. You willing accept balances power bad guys end winning. I not."  "That answer," old wizard said; face showed nothing hurt, long practice concealing pain. "Refusing accept something change it. I wonder simply young understand matter, Harry, despite outward airs; children's fantasies battles won, single evil tolerated."  "And that's I destroy Dementors can't," said boy. "Because I believe darkness broken."  The old wizard's breath stopped throat.  "The phoenix's price inevitable," boy said. "It's part deep balance built universe. It's parts problem figured yet cheat."  The old wizard's lips parted, words came forth.  Silver light falling shattered wands.  "Fawkes gave mission," boy repeated, "and I carry mission I must break entire Ministry it. That's part answer missing. You stop say, oh well, guess I can't possibly figure way stop bullying Hogwarts, leave that. You keep looking figure it. If requires breaking Lucius Malfoy's entire conspiracy, fine."  "And true fight, fight Voldemort?" old wizard said unsteady voice. "What win that, Harry? Will break whole world? Even someday gain power, yet beyond prices, perhaps never be! For act way nothing short madness!"  "I asked Professor Quirrell he'd laughed," boy said evenly, "after awarded Hermione hundred points. And Professor Quirrell said, exact words, pretty much said, he'd found tremendously amusing great good Albus Dumbledore sitting nothing poor innocent girl begged help, one defend her. And told time good moral people done tying knots, usually nothing; or, act, could hardly tell apart people called bad. Whereas could help innocent girls time felt like it, good person. And I ought remember that, time I considered growing good."  The old wizard show force blow. Only slight widening eyes would betrayed it, watching closely.  "Don't worry, Headmaster," said boy. "I gotten wires crossed. I know I'm supposed learn goodness Hermione Fawkes, Professor Quirrell you. Which brings actual reason I came here. Hermione's time valuable waste detentions. Professor Snape revoke it, claiming I blackmailed him."  After hesitation old wizard nodded head, silver beard swaying slowly beneath. "That would best her, Harry," old wizard said. "But detention put served Professor Binns, and study together classroom."  "Fine," boy said. "I think business together, end. You may expect, next time seem working side bad guys letting win, I whatever I think Fawkes would tell to, regardless much trouble comes it. I hope we're clear that."  Without another word, boy turned walked room, open door black metal, words "Lumos!" light wand following moment later.  The old wizard stood silent, silent amid ruins lives life left behind. His wrinkled hand rose, shaking, touch half-moon glasses -  The boy poked head back in. "Would mind switching stairs, Headmaster? I'd rather go work leave way I came."  "Go, Harry Potter," old wizard said. "The stairs receive you."  (Some time later, earlier version Harry, invisibly waited next gargoyles since 9PM, followed Deputy Headmistress opening parted her, stood quietly behind turning stairs came top, then, still Cloak, spun Time-Turner thrice.)   Aftermath: Professor Quirrell -  In shadowy clearing Defense Professor waited, back leaned negligently rough grey bark towering beech tree yet unleaved late March days, trunk crown seemed like pale arm reaching ground exploding hand thousand fingers. Around Defense Professor branches dense even earliest spring, trees much budding, could hardly seen sky ground. The strands wooden net crossed proliferated many times broomstick above, searching someone below, would found easier follow ears eyes. Nor would helped almost dark amid prohibited woods, unseen sun almost set, glows fading sunlight illuminated tops tallest trees.  Then came faintest sound footsteps, almost inaudible even forest ground; gait man accustomed passing unseen. No twig snapped, leaf rustled -  "Good afternoon," said Professor Quirrell. The Defense Professor trouble move eyes, hands rested negligently side.  A figure clad black cloak shimmered existence, head turning look left right. In figure's right hand, gripped low, wand wood grey almost silver.  "I know wished meet places," said Severus Snape, voice cool.  "Oh," Professor Quirrell said idly, though whole matter least importance, "I thought would prefer privacy. The walls Hogwarts ears, would wish Headmaster know role yesterday's affair, would you?"  The March chill seemed grow deeper, temperature fall. "I know talking about," Potions Master said icily.  "You know perfectly well we're talking about," said Professor Quirrell amused voice. "Really, good Professor, meddle affairs idiots unless ready defend upon instant violence." (The Defense Professor's hands still lay relaxed open side.) "And yet none idiots seem remember sight falling, young ladies recall presence. Which raises fascinating question would go extraordinary length, I dare say desperate length, casting fifty-two Memory Charms." Professor Quirrell tilted head. "Would fear much opinions mere students? I think not. Would dread matter becoming known good friend, Lord Malfoy? But fools, upon spot, invented quite satisfactory excuse presence. No, one person holds much power you, would perturbed find executing plot without knowledge. Your true hidden master, Albus Dumbledore."  "What?" hissed Potions Master, anger plain upon face.  "But now, seems, moving own; I find intrigued could possibly doing, why." The Defense Professor regarded black-clad silhouette Potions Master scrutiny man might give exceptionally interesting bug, even still ultimately bug.  "I servant Dumbledore's," Potions Master said coldly.  "Really? What astonishing news." The Defense Professor smiled slightly. "Do tell it."  There long pause. From tree owl hooted, sound huge silence; neither man startled flinched.  "You want enemy, Quirrell," Severus Snape said, voice soft.  "I don't?" said Professor Quirrell. "How would know?"  "On hand," Potions Master continued, voice still soft, "my friends enjoy many advantages."  The man leaning grey bark raised eyebrows. "Such as?"  "There much I know school," said Potions Master. "Things might think I knew."  There expectant pause.  "How incredibly fascinating," said Professor Quirrell. The man examining fingernails bored look. "Do go on."  "I know been... investigating... third-floor corridor -"  "You know nothing sort." The man's back straightened wood. "Do bluff me, Severus Snape; I find annoying, position annoy me. A single glance would tell competent wizard Headmaster laced corridor ridiculous quantity wards webs, triggers tripsigns. And more: Charms laid ancient power, magical constructs I heard even rumors, techniques must disgorged hoarded lore Flamel himself. Even He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named would trouble passing without notice." Professor Quirrell tapped thoughtful finger cheek. "And actual lock, Colloportus laid ordinary doorknob, cast weakly could kept Miss Granger day entered Hogwarts. Never existence I encountered blatant trap." Now Defense Professor narrowed eyes. "I know one left world fantastic feats detection would serve useful purpose. If wizard possessed ancient lore, I know nothing, trap set - may trade information much silence like, dear Professor, good serving favor left afterward."  You could sworn Professor Quirrell watching Severus Snape keen interest. Not faintest trace smile crossed man's lips.  There another long silence clearing.  "I know Dumbledore fears," Snape said. "But I know bait set out, somewhat truly guarded -"  "As that," said Professor Quirrell, sounding bored again, "I stole months ago, left fake place. But thank kindly asking."  "You're lying," said Severus Snape pause.  "Yes, I am." Professor Quirrell leaned back grey wood again, eyes drifting dense net branches, falling night scarcely visible complex crossings. "I simply wished learn whether would call it, since pretending know little." The Defense Professor smiled himself.  The Potions Master looked like choke fury. "What want?"  "Nothing, really," said Defense Professor, continuing gaze forest ceiling. "I curious. I suppose I shall watch see plotting goes, meanwhile I say nothing Headmaster - long willing favor then, course." A dry smile crossed face. "You dismissed now, Severus Snape. Though I mind another little chat soon, willing speak honestly loyalties lie. And I mean honestly, false faces shown today. You might find allies thought. Take time think over, friend."   Aftermath: Draco Malfoy -  A rainbow hemisphere, dome solid force little chromaticity sent back infringing light splintered reflections, iridescent many colors, fractured shine many-splendored chandeliers Slytherin common room.  Sheltered beneath rainbow hemisphere, terrified face young witch never fought bullies, joined Professor Quirrell's armies, getting Acceptable marks best Defense class, could cast Prismatic Barrier even save life.  "Oh, stop it," said Draco Malfoy, making voice sound bored despite sweat broken underneath robes, kept wand pointed barrier sheltering Millicent Bulstrode.  He remember making decision, there'd two older boys hex Millicent, common room silently staring, Draco's hand drawn wand cast barrier, leaving heart pump full shocked adrenaline poor sad brain frantically racked explanations -  The two older boys straightening they'd looming Millicent, turning Draco, looking mixture shock anger. Gregory Vincent beside already drawn wands, pointing them. All three together won, anyway.  But older boys hex him. Nobody could possibly stupid enough hex next Lord Malfoy.  It fear hexed making Draco sweat beneath robes, desperately hoped beads water visible forehead.  Draco sweating dawning sickening certainty even got away now, kept path, would come time would come crashing down; might next Lord Malfoy anymore.  "Mr. Malfoy," said oldest-looking boy. "Why protecting her?"  "So located mistress conspiracy," Draco said Number Two Sneer, "and it's, let get straight now, first-year girl named Millicent Bulstrode. She's conduit, niddlewit!"  "So?" demanded older boy. "She still helped them!"  Draco lifted wand Prismatic Sphere winked out. Still talking bored voice, Draco said, "Did know doing, Miss Bulstrode?"  "N-no," Millicent stammered still sitting desk.  "Did know Slytherin messages passing going to?"  "No!" said Millicent.  "Thank you," Draco said. "All please leave alone, pawn. Miss Bulstrode, may consider favor February repaid." And Draco turned back Potions homework, hoping Merlin back Millicent say anything incredibly stupid like 'What favor?' -  "Then why," voice said clearly across room, "did witches go note Millicent told go?"  Sweating even more, Draco lifted head look Randolph Lee spoken. "What fake note say exactly?" said Draco. "Was it, 'I command go forth name Dark Lady Bulstrode' 'Please meet here, sincerely Millicent?'"  Randolph Lee opened mouth, hesitated fractional second -  "I thought so," said Draco. "That good test, Mr. Lee, - -" A frantic, nerve-racking moment figured say without using Harry-words like false positive. "It get witches go friends Millicent."  As though matter entirely settled, Draco looked Potions homework, ignoring (except feeling sick dread stomach) whispers around room.  It corner eye caught Gregory staring him.   Draco's eyes rested Astronomy homework, make mind focus there. If trying think things Harry Potter said, pretty much worst possible thing could look textbook's pictures night sky, try remember supposed know planets wandered. Astronomy, noble prestigious art, sign learning knowledge; Muggles possessed secret modern artifacts could million billion times better using methods Harry tried explain Draco still begin understand except apparently even take magic make things Arithmancy.  Draco looked pictures constellations, wondered like Houses, people always threatening Ravenclaw.  Harry Potter told soldiers battlefield really fight country. Patriotism might get battlefield first place, there, fought protect other, friends they'd trained right front them. And Harry observed, Draco known true, use loyalty leader power Patronus Charm, quite right kind warm happy thought. But thinking protecting someone beside -  That, Harry Potter said thoughtfully, probably Death Eaters fallen apart moment Dark Lord departed. They warm enough other.  You could recruit group included Bellatrix Black Amycus Carrow alongside Lord Malfoy Mr. MacNair, keep line Cruciatus Curse. But instant master Dark Mark gone, army anymore, circle acquaintances. That Father failed. It even really fault. There'd nothing Father could done, inheriting Death Eaters really friends other.  And even though Slytherin House supposed defend - Slytherin House Harry formed pact save - sometimes Draco help think less wearisome leading army practices. When working students three Houses Slytherin. Once saw named problems, stop seeing them, got annoying every day.  "Mr. Malfoy?" said voice Gregory Goyle, lying floor beside Draco's desk, small private bedroom; Gregory Transfiguration homework, often needed help.  Any distraction welcome point. "Yes?" said Draco.  "You really plotting Granger all," said Gregory. "Were you?"  The sensation spreading Draco's stomach felt like Gregory's voice sounded, sickened afraid.  "You actually helping Granger, day picked floor," said Gregory. "And before, time kept falling roof. You helped mudblood -"  "Yeah, right," said Draco sarcastically, without slightest hesitation delay, looking back Astronomy homework like least bit nervous. It happening way Draco feared would, least meant he'd played conversation head over, coming right opening gambit. "Come on, Gregory, dueled General Granger, know strong spells are. Like real Muggle-spawn going powerful you, powerful Theodore, powerful every single pureblood whole school year except me? Don't actually believe anything Father says? She's adopted. Her parents died war someone stuck couple Muggles hide her. No way General Granger real mudblood."  A slow pulse silence Draco's bedroom. Draco wanted know, needed know look Gregory's face. But look desk, yet, Gregory spoke first.  And -  "Is Harry Potter said you?" said Gregory.  The voice wavered, broke. When Draco looked homework, saw tears leaking Gregory's eyes.  Apparently worked.  "I know do," Gregory said whisper. "I know now, Mr. Malfoy. Your father - finds - he's going like it, Mr. Malfoy!"  It's job decide Father like, Goyle -  Draco could hear words head; sounded Father's voice, sternness. It sort thing Father told say, Vincent Gregory ever questioned him; work hex them. They equal friends, Father said, ever forget it. Draco charge, servants, Draco keep way fit inherit House Malfoy...  "It's right, Gregory," Draco said, gently could. "All got worry protecting me. Nobody's going blame following orders, father, yours." Putting warmth could voice, like trying cast Patronus Charm. "And anyway, next war going last one. House Malfoy around long Dark Lord, every Lord Malfoy thing. Father knows that."  "Does he?" said Gregory trembling voice. "Does really?"  Draco nodded. "Professor Quirrell knows too," said Draco. "That's armies about. The Defense Professor's right, next war comes, Father able unite whole country, they'll remember last war. But anyone who's fought Professor Quirrell's armies remember strongest generals were, they'll know who's worthy lead them. They'll proclaim Harry Potter Lord, I'll right hand, House Malfoy come top, like always. People might even turn me, Potter there, long think I'm trustworthy. That's I'm setting now. Father understand."  Gregory reached wiped eyes, looking Transfiguration homework. "Okay," Gregory said shaky voice. "If say so, Mr. Malfoy."  Draco nodded again, ignoring hollow feeling inside lies he'd told friend, turned back stars.   Aftermath: Hermione Granger -  Being invisible interesting this, corridors Hogwarts outlined strange colors something. But actually, Hermione thought, Harry's invisibility cloak exactly like invisibility cloak, except cloak part. When pulled veil soft black cloth hood face, even see stretching front you, afterward seem impede breathing. And world looked same, except walked past things metal, see small reflections yourself. Portraits never looked you, whatever strange things alone. Hermione tried walking past mirror yet, sure wanted to. Most all, anymore walked around, hands, feet, changing point view. It unnerving feeling, much invisible existing.  Harry questioned all, she'd got word 'invisibility' Harry drawing invisibility cloak pouch. She even given chance explain extremely secret meeting Daphne Millicent Bulstrode, thought would help protect girls, Harry handed probably Deathly Hallow. If fair, try fair, admit sometimes Harry could true, true friend.  The secret meeting great big failure.  Millicent claimed seer.  Hermione carefully explained Millicent Daphne considerable length could possibly true.  She Harry looked Divination early research; Harry insisted read everything could find prophecies Restricted Section. As Harry observed, would save lot effort could get seer prophesy everything would figure thirty-five years later. (Or put Harry's terms, means obtaining information transmitted distant future potentially instant global victory condition.)  But, Hermione explained Millicent, prophesying controllable, way ask prophecy anything particular. Instead (the books said) sort pressure built Time, huge event trying happen, stop happening. And seers like weak points let pressure, right listener nearby. So prophecies big, important things, generated enough pressure; almost never got one seer saying thing, afterward pressure gone. And, Hermione explained Millicent, seers remember prophecies, message them. And messages would come riddles, someone heard prophecy seer's original voice would hear meaning riddle. There possible way Millicent could give prophecy time wanted, school bullies, remember it, would've come 'the skeleton key' 'Susan Bones there'.  Millicent looking rather frightened point, Hermione relaxed fists they'd jammed hips, calmed down, stated carefully glad Millicent helped them, sometimes walked traps following Millicent said, Hermione really want know messages actually come from.  And Millicent said small voice:  But, told seer...  Hermione told Daphne press it, Millicent refused give source. It Hermione felt awful scared look Millicent's face. It Hermione strong feeling find person who'd telling Millicent things, why, would turn finding envelopes pillow morning.  She getting despairing feeling she'd gotten battle Christmas, looking Zabini's charts colored lines boxes and... realized meant Zabini one showing chart.  Even Ravenclaw, felt, thing life get overly complicated.  Hermione began ascending short spiral yellow marble steps protruding central spine, poorly-kept "secret" staircase actually one fastest ways Slytherin dungeons Ravenclaw tower, witches could traverse. (Why girls particular needed quick way move Ravenclaw Slytherin back something Hermione found bit puzzling.) At top staircase, away Slytherin places back main parts Hogwarts, Hermione stopped took Harry's invisibility cloak.  After pouch swallowed cloak, Hermione turned right started walk short passageway, automatically keeping eye directions without really thinking it, constantly-scanning eyes glanced shadowy alcove -  (fleeting disorientation)  - rush shock fear hit like Stunning Hex whole body, found without thought conscious decision wand leaped hand already pointed at...  ...a black cloak wide billowing impossible determine whether figure beneath male female, atop cloak broad-brimmed black hat; black mist seemed gather beneath obscure face whoever whatever might lie beneath.  "Hello again, Hermione," whispered sibilant voice beneath black hat, behind black mist.  Hermione's heart already pounding hugely inside chest, witch's robes felt already sweat-dampened skin, taste fear already mouth; know suddenly filled adrenaline hand gripped harder wand. "Who you?" Hermione demanded.  The hat tilted slightly; whispery voice, came forth black mist, sounded dry dust. "The last ally," spoke sibilant whisper. "The one finally answers, answer you. I perhaps true friend Hogwarts, Hermione. For seen others stayed silent need -"  "What's name?"  The black cloak rotated slightly, back forth, look like shoulders shrugging, conveyed shrug. "That riddle, young Ravenclaw. Until solve it, may call whatever wish."  She could feel palm already sweaty thankful spiral grooves wand helped hand keep steady grip wood. "Well, Mister Incredibly Suspicious Person," Hermione said, "what want me?"  "That wrong question," came whisper black mist. "You ask, rather, I offer you."  "No," young girl said quite steadily, "I think I asking that, actually."  A high-pitched chuckle behind black mist. "Not power," whispered voice, "not wealth, care little things, you, young Ravenclaw? Knowledge. That I possess. I know unfolding within school, hidden plans players, answers riddle. I know true reason coldness see Harry Potter's eyes. I know true nature Professor Quirrell's mysterious illness. I know Dumbledore truly fears."  "Good you," said Hermione Granger. "But know many licks takes get Tootsie Roll center Tootsie Pop?"  The black mist seemed darken slightly, voice sounded lower spoke, disappointed. "So even curious, young Ravenclaw, truths behind lies?"  "One hundred eighty-seven," said. "I tried that's many came to." Her hand almost slipping wand, sense fatigue fingers like she'd holding wand hours instead minutes -  The voice hissed, "Professor Snape hidden Death Eater."  Hermione almost dropped wand.  "Ah," voice whispered satisfaction. "I thought might interest you. So, Hermione. Is anything else would like know enemies, call friends?"  She stared black mist topped towering black cloak, frantically trying order thoughts. Professor Snape Death Eater? Who would tell something like that, why, going on? "That's -" Hermione said. Her voice quavering. "That's extremely serious business, really true. Why telling something like me, Headmaster Dumbledore?"  "Dumbledore nothing stop Snape," black mist whispered. "You saw it, Hermione. The rot Hogwarts begins top. Everything wrong school, begins mad Headmaster. You alone dared call - therefore I speak you."  "And also spoken Harry Potter, then?" Hermoine said, keeping voice even could. If helpful ghost -  The black mist darkened lightened, like shake head. "I frightened Harry Potter," whispered. "Of coldness eyes, darkness grows behind them. Harry Potter killer, anyone obstacle die. Even you, Hermione Granger, dare truly oppose him, darkness behind eyes reach destroy you. This I know."  "Then know half pretend know," Hermione said, voice little firmer. "I'm scared Harry too. But might ever me. I'm scared might protect -"  "Wrong." The whisper flat, hard, brook possibility denial. "Harry Potter turn time, Hermione, darkness takes fully. He shed tear, even notice, day footsteps finally crush underneath."  "Double wrong!" said back rising voice, even though chills going spine. One Harry's phrases came her. "Just think know, think know it, anyway?"  "Time -" The voice seemed catch itself. "Time enough later. For now, today, indeed Harry Potter enemy. And yet gravest danger."  "I believe that," said Hermione Granger. She desperately wanted shift wand hand, felt like needed grab right arm keep up, head ached like she'd staring black mist days; know she'd gotten tired quickly.  "Lucius Malfoy taken notice you, Hermione." The whisper risen, departed tonelessness, taken note audible concern. "You humiliated Slytherin House, defeated son battle. Even embarrassment stand Death Eaters; Muggleborn yet possess power wizardry greater pureblood. And becoming known, eyes world you. Lucius Malfoy seeks crush you, Hermione, hurt perhaps even kill you, means it!" The whisper grown urgent.  There pause.  "Is all?" Hermione said. If ex-Colonel Zabini Harry Potter, she'd probably asking clever questions gather information; mind felt slow fatigued. She really needed get go lie while.  "You believe me," whisper said, softer sadder now. "Why not, Hermione? I trying help you."  Hermione took step backward, away shadowy alcove.  "Why not, Hermione?" demanded voice, rising hiss. "You owe much! Tell me, -" The voice caught, came back quieter. "And go, I suppose. Only tell - -"  Maybe shouldn't've answered; maybe turned fled, better yet, cast Prismatic Wall first screamed top lungs ran; note real pain voice caught her, answered.  "Because look incredibly dark scary suspicious," Hermione said, keeping voice polite, wand stayed level towering black cloak faceless black mist.  "That's all?" whispered voice incredulously. Sadness seemed infuse it. "I hoped better you, Hermione. Surely Ravenclaw you, intelligent Ravenclaw grace Hogwarts generation, knows appearances misleading."  "Oh, I know it," said Hermione. She took another step back, tired fingers tightening wand. "But thing people forget sometimes, even though appearances misleading, they're usually not."  There pause.  "You clever one," said voice, black mist evaporated away, longer obscuring; saw face beneath, recognition sent jolt terrified adrenaline bursting -  (fleeting disorientation)  - rush shock fear hit like Stunning Hex whole body, found without thought conscious decision wand leaped hand already pointed at...  ...a shining lady, long white dress billowing though invisible winds; neither hands feet visible, face hidden beneath white veil; glowing over, like ghost, transparent, surrounded soft white light.  Hermione stared open-mouthed gentle sight, wondering heart already hammering, felt scared.  "Hello again, Hermione," kindly whisper emanated white glow behind veil. "I've sent help you, please afraid. I servant things; you, Lady, bearer marvelous destiny -"  ...  ...  ...   Chapter 78: Taboo Tradeoffs Prelude: Cheating  It Saturday, 4th April, year 1992.  Mr. Mrs. Davis looked rather nervous, sat certain special section Hogwarts Quidditch stands - though today cushioned benches look upon flying broomsticks, rather viewed gigantic square something like parchment; great white blankness soon flicker windows grass soldiers. For showed reflected dull gray color surrounding overcast skies. (Looking rather stormy, though weather-wizards promised rain break nightfall.)  Ordinarily ancient tradition Hogwarts mere parents Stay Out - much reason impatient children told get kitchen meddle cook's affairs. The reason parent-teacher conference teacher felt parent shaping properly. It took exceptional circumstance make Hogwarts administration feel justify you. On given occasion, generally speaking, Hogwarts administration backed eight hundred years distinguished history not.  Thus trepidation Mr. Mrs. Davis insisted audience Deputy Headmistress McGonagall. It hard muster proper sense indignation confronting dignified witch who, twelve years four months earlier, given two weeks' detention catching act conceiving Tracey.  On hand, Mr. Mrs. Davis's courage helped angrily waving copy TheQuibbler whose headline showed, bright bold text world see:  PACTS WITH POTTER?   BONES, DAVIS, GRANGER   IN LOVE RECTANGLE OF FEAR  And Mr. Mrs. Davis argued way Faculty Box Hogwarts Quidditch stands, ensconced excellent view Professor Quirrell's enchanted screens, two could see "Just Fiddly-Snocks going school, pardon expression, Deputy Headmistress McGonagall!"  Seated left Mr. Davis another concerned parent, white-haired man elegant black robes unmatchable quality, one Lucius Malfoy, political leader strongest faction Wizengamot.  To left Lord Malfoy, sneeringly aristocratic man scarred face introduced Lord Jugson.  Then elderly sharp-eyed fellow named Charles Nott, rumored nearly wealthy Lord Malfoy, seated Lord Jugson's left.  On right Mrs. Davis, one would find comely Lady yet handsomer Lord Noble Most Ancient House Greengrass. Young wizards counted age, garbed grey silken robes set tiny dark emeralds embroidered shape grass blades. The Lady Greengrass considered key swing vote Wizengamot, mother retired body surprising speed. Her charming husband, though family noble wealthy itself, taken seat Hogwarts Board Governors.  To right, square-jawed incredibly tough-looking old witch, shaken hands Mr. Mrs. Davis without slightest hint condescension. This Amelia Bones, Director Department Magical Law Enforcement.  To Amelia's right seniorish woman set fashion scene magical Britain ear integrating live vulture hat, one Augusta Longbottom. Though addressed Lady, Madam Longbottom would exercise full rights Longbottom family long last scion yet attain majority, considered prominent figure minority faction Wizengamot.  At side Madam Longbottom seated none Chief Warlock Supreme Mugwump Headmaster Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore, legendary defeater Grindelwald, protector Britain, rediscoverer fabled twelve uses dragon's blood, powerful wizard world &c.  And finally, far right, one would find enigmatic Defense Professor Hogwarts, Quirinus Quirrell, leaning back cushioned benches though resting; seeming entirely naturally ease rarefied company voting quorum Hogwarts Board Governors, dropped fine Saturday learn Fiddly-Snocks going Hogwarts general Draco Malfoy, Theodore Nott, Daphne Greengrass, Susan Bones, Neville Longbottom particular. The name Harry Potter also much discussed.  Oh, one forget Tracey Davis, course. Director Bones's eyebrows climbed interest upon hearing young couple introduced parents. Lord Jugson given brief, incredulous stare dismissing snort. Lucius Malfoy greeted politely, smile containing hint grim amusement mixed pity.  Mr. Mrs. Davis, whose last vote anything significance touching wands name Minister Fudge, three hundred Galleons stored Gringotts vault, respectively worked selling cauldrons Potions shop enchanting Omnioculars, pressed tightly other, sitting rigidly erect upon cushioned benches, desperately wishing they'd worn nicer robes.  The sky solid mass cloud dispersed darker lighter grays, grim promise future storms; though lightning flickered yet, distant rumbles thunder echoed; threatening droplets fallen.   To designated starting place certain forest, Sunshine Regiment marched, though really like slow walk; want tire battle even started, breezes April annoyingly humid, though cool. Ahead them, yellow flame wandered slowly air, guiding according pace.  Susan Bones kept throwing worried glances toward Sunshine General marched grayly illuminated forest. Professor Snape's going Hermione seemed really shaken her. Hermione even missed Sunshine Regiment Official Planning Meeting, seemed understandable enough; Susan offered sympathy afterward, Hermione stammered she'd lost track time, usual thing say, girl looked exhausted frightened like she'd spent three days locked bathroom stall Dementor. Even now, Sunshine General's focus coming battle, Ravenclaw girl's gaze constantly darting directions, though expected Dark Wizards jump bushes sacrifice her.  "The ban Muggle artifacts cuts options lot," Anthony Goldstein saying dour tones boy used denote deliberate pessimism. "I idea trying Transfigure nets throw people, -"  "No good," said Ernie Macmillan. The Hufflepuff boy shook head, looking even serious Anthony. "I mean, like throwing hex, they'd dodge."  Anthony nodded. "That's I figured, too. Do ideas, Seamus?"  The former Chaotic Lieutenant still looked bit nervous out-of-place, marching along new comrades Sunshine Regiment. "Sorry," said newly minted Captain Finnigan. "I'm strategic master type."  "I'm strategic master type," said Ron Weasley, sounding put-off.  "There three armies," Sunshine General said acerbically, "which means fight two armies once, means need one strategist, means shut up, Ron!"  Ron gave General surprised worried look. "Hey," Gryffindor boy said calming tone, "you let Snape get much -"  "What think ought do, General?" Susan said loudly quickly. "I mean, really plan point." Their official planning session failed amazingly Hermione gone Ron Anthony thinking charge.  "Do really need plan?" Sunshine General said, sounding little distracted. "We've got and Lavender Parvati Hannah Daphne Ron Ernie Anthony Captain Finnigan."  "That -" began Anthony.  "Sounds like pretty good strategy," Ron said approving nod. "We've got many strong soldiers armies put together. Chaos's got Potter Longbottom Nott left - well, Zabini too, I suppose -"  "And Tracey," said Hermione.  Several people swallowed nervously.  "Oh, stop it," Susan said sharply. "She's battle-hardened member S.P.H.E.W., that's General Sunshine means."  "Still," Ernie said, turning look seriously Susan, "I think better go whatever group fights Chaos, Captain Bones. I know can't use double magical powers except innocents danger, I mean - case Miss Davis does, know, go control try eat someone's soul -"  "I handle her," Susan told him, keeping voice reassuring. Admittedly, Susan replaced Metamorphmagus moment, Tracey probably Polyjuiced Dumbledore whoever.  Captain Finnigan intoned deep, sort-of-rumbling voice, "I find lack skepticism disturbing." He raised hand thumb forefinger almost touching, pointed Ernie.  For reason Anthony Goldstein seemed sudden choking fit. "What's supposed mean?" said Ernie.  "It's something General Potter says sometimes," said Captain Finnigan. "Funny, first join Chaos Legion seems crazy, couple months realize actually everyone Chaos Legion crazy -"  "I said," Ron said loudly, "it sounds like good strategy. We Transfigure anything, tire out, handle whatever throw us, overrun them."  "Okay," said Hermione. "Let's that."  "But -" said Anthony, shooting glare Ron. "But General, Harry Potter's got sixteen people left army. Dragon us twenty-eight. Harry knows that, knows he's got come something incredible -"  "Like what?" demanded Hermione, sounding stressed. "If know he's planning, might well save magic massed Finites. Like done last time!"  Susan touched Hermione gently shoulder. "General Granger?" said Susan. "I think take break bit battle."  She'd expecting Hermione argue, Hermione nodded walked little faster, pulling away Sunshine Regiment Official Officer Group, eyes still watching forest, sometimes sky.  Susan followed her. It do, look like Sunshine General ejected Official Officer Group.  "Hermione?" Susan said softly, they'd walked bit away. "You've got focus. Professor Quirrell's charge here, Snape, let anything bad happen anyone."  "You're helping," Hermione said, sounding shaky. "You're helping all, Captain Bones."  The two walked faster, circling around soldiers, inspecting marching perimeter glancing surrounding trees.  "Susan?" Hermione said small voice, they'd gotten away others. "Do think Daphne's right Draco Malfoy plotting something?"  "Yes," Susan said once, even thinking it. "You tell, name's got letters M-A-L-F-O Y it."  Hermione looked around, make sure nobody watching, although course wonderful way get people pay attention you. "Could Malfoy behind Snape did?"  "Snape could behind Malfoy," Susan said thoughtfully, remembering dinner-table conversations she'd heard Auntie's, "or Lucius Malfoy could behind them." A slight chill went Susan's spine last thought occurred her. Suddenly, telling Hermione focus coming battle seemed lot less reasonable. "Why, find sort clue that?"  Hermione shook head. "No," Ravenclaw girl said, voice sounded almost like cry. "I - thinking - that's all."   In designated place forest near Hogwarts, Dragon General warriors Dragon Army waited red flame led them, beneath grey skies.  At Draco's right side stood Padma Patil, second-in-command, led Dragon Army Draco stunned. At Draco's back Vincent, son Crabbe, family served Malfoys distance forgotten memory; muscular boy watchful always watchful, whether battle declared no. Further back, Gregory Goyles stood waiting beside one two broomsticks Dragon Army given; Goyles served Malfoys long Crabbes, yet served less well.  And Draco's left side, now, stood one Dean Thomas Gryffindor, mudblood possible half-blood knew nothing father.  Sending Dean Thomas Dragon Army quite deliberate move Harry's part, Draco certain. Three former Chaotics also transferred Dragon Army, watching Draco hawklike see offered former Lieutenant slightest insult.  Some might called sabotage, Draco knew better. Harry also sent Lieutenant Finnigan Sunshine Regiment, even though Professor Quirrell's mandate required Harry give one Lieutenant. That deliberate move, making crystal clear everyone Harry dumping least-favored soldiers.  In one sense, might easier Draco win true loyalties new soldiers they'd thought Harry wanted them. In another sense... well, easy put words. Harry given good soldiers pride intact, that. Harry showed kindliness toward soldiers, that. It Harry playing fair, something that... help contrast way game played Slytherin House.  So Draco offered slightest insult Mr. Thomas, brought straight side, subordinate Padma one else. It test, Draco told Mr. Thomas everyone, promotion. Mr. Thomas would show worthy rank within Dragon Army - would given chance, chance would fair. Mr. Thomas looked surprised ceremony (the Chaos Legion, Draco heard, stand formality) Gryffindor boy stood little straighter, nodded.  And then, Mr. Thomas done well enough one Dragon Army's training sessions, he'd brought strategy session Dragon Army's huge military office. And minutes session, Padma happened ask - though perfectly normal question - whether Mr. Thomas ideas defeat Chaos Legion.  The Gryffindor boy said cheerfully Harry predicted General Malfoy would get one soldiers ask that, Harry given message General Malfoy ask relative advantage lay - Draco Malfoy could do, Dragon Army could do, Chaos Legion match - try exploit worth. Dean Thomas think advantage might be, come ideas beating Chaos, he'd share them. Harry ordered to, all.  Sigh, Draco thought, since actually sigh loud. But good advice, Draco followed it, sitting bedroom desk quill parchment listing everything might relative advantage.  And, almost Draco's surprise, he'd idea, real one. In fact he'd two.  The hollow bell sounded forest, somehow sounding ominous ever before. On instant, two pilots cried "Up!" leapt onto broomsticks, heading gray sky.   Mr. Mrs. Davis slumped slightly other, sheer muscle exhaustion decrease tension. Before them, vast blank white parchment flickered three great windows, though holes cut forest, showing three armies march. Lesser windows showed six riders upon broomsticks, corner parchment showed view entire forest, glowing dots indicate armies scouts.  The window Sunshine showed General Granger Captains marching center Sunshine Regiment, protected Contego screens along number young witches. The Sunshine Regiment, Defense Professor remarked, knew well acquired strong advantage experienced soldiers, meant protect soldiers surprise attack. Aside that, Sunshine Soldiers moving forward steady march, conserving strength.  The soldiers General Malfoy's army, least higher Transfiguration scores, picking leaves Transfiguring into... well, looked Padma Patil, almost done hers, looked like leaf becoming left-handed glove bearing dangling strap. (The window zoomed show this.)  Lord Jugson watching screen flat expression; voice, spoke, seemed ooze drip disdain. "What son doing, Lucius?"  The foreign-born witch stood Draco Malfoy's right side finished Transfiguring glove, bringing Dragon General like sacrifice.  "I know," said Lucius Malfoy, tone calm though less aristocratic, "but I must trust good reason it."  All Dragon Army stopped moment Padma slid glove left hand, strapped place, presented Draco Malfoy; also stopped place, took several deep breaths, raised wand, executed precise set eight movements bellowed "Colloportus!"  The Dragon Warrior raised gloved hand, flexed it, gave small bow Draco Malfoy, returned shallowly, though Dragon General staggering slightly. Padma returned place Draco's side, Dragons began marching more.  "Well," remarked Augusta Longbottom. "I suppose someone would care explain?" Amelia Bones frowning slightly gazed screen.  "For reason other," said amused voice Professor Quirrell, "it seems scion Malfoy able cast surprisingly strong magic first-year student. Due purity blood, course. Certainly good Lord Malfoy would openly flouted underage magic laws arranging son receive wand acceptance Hogwarts."  "I suggest careful implications, Quirrell," Lucius Malfoy said coldly.  "Oh, I am," Professor Quirrell said. "A Colloportus cannot dispelled Finite Incantatem; requires Alohomora equal strength. Until then, glove Charmed resist lesser material forces, deflect Sleep Hex Stunning Hex. And neither Mr. Potter Miss Granger cast counterspell powerful enough, Charm invincible upon battlefield. It original intent Charm, intent whoever taught Mr. Malfoy emergency spell evading enemies. But would seem Mr. Malfoy learning creativity."  Lucius Malfoy straightened Defense Professor spoke; sat erect upon cushioned bench, head held perceptibly higher before, spoke quiet pride. "He greatest Lord Malfoy yet lived."  "Faint praise," Augusta Longbottom said breath; Amelia Bones chuckled, Mr. Davis tiny, fatal fraction second stopped strangled gargle.  "I quite agree," said Professor Quirrell, though clear spoke. "Unfortunately Mr. Malfoy, still new art creativity, committed classic error Ravenclaw."  "And might be?" said Lucius Malfoy, voice turned chill more.  Professor Quirrell leaned back seat, pale blue eyes briefly unfocusing one windows shifted viewpoint within greater screen, zooming show sweat Draco Malfoy's forehead. "It beautiful idea Mr. Malfoy quite overlooked pragmatic difficulties."  "Would someone care explain that?" said Lady Greengrass. "Not us present experts such... affairs."  Amelia Bones spoke, old witch's voice somewhat dry. "It tempt try catch hexes would wiser simply dodge. The so, little practice catching them. And casting many Charms tire strongest warrior."  Professor Quirrell gave DMLE Director half-nod acknowledgment. "As say, Madam Bones. Mr. Malfoy new business ideas, one, becomes proud it. He yet enough ideas unflinchingly discard beautiful aspects impractical others; yet acquired confidence ability think better ideas requires them. What seeing Mr. Malfoy's best idea, I fear, rather idea."  Lord Malfoy simply turned watch screens again, though Defense Professor used right exist.  "But -" said Lord Greengrass. "But Merlin's name Harry Potter -"   Sixteen remaining soldiers Chaos Legion - fifteen plus Blaise Zabini, rather - marched confidently forest, shoes thudding still-dry ground. Their camouflage uniforms blended forest even usual, colors washed tints overcast day.  Sixteen Chaos Legionnaires, twenty-eight Dragon Warriors twenty-eight Sunshine Soldiers.  The common consensus that, odds bad, practically impossible lose. After all, General Chaos bound come something really spectacular, facing odds like that.  There something almost nightmarish everyone seemed expect Harry pull miracles hat, demand, time one needed. It meant impossible, disappointing friends failing live potential...  Harry bothered complaining Professor Quirrell 'too much pressure'. Harry's mental model Defense Professor predicted looking severely annoyed, saying things along lines You perfectly capable solving problem, Mr. Potter; even try? deducting several hundred Quirrell points.  From above, two broomsticks watched march, high young voice Tess Walsh cried "Friend!" another moment, "Gingersnap!"  A handful seconds later, soldier who'd code-named Gingersnap returned bearing double handful acorns, sweating slightly cool humid air jog taken oak tree Neville spotted. Gingersnap approached Shannon holding uniform-shirt neck tied off, lieu anyone Transfigure bag. When Gingersnap brought hands forward try dump acorns holding-shirt, Chaotic Shannon, giggling, jerked shirt right, left Gingersnap made another effort dump acorns, sharp "Miss Friedman!" Lieutenant Nott caused Shannon sigh hold shirt still. Gingersnap dumped acorns accumulated, headed more.  Somewhere background, Ellie Knight singing version Chaos Legion's marching song, around half soldiers trying step along despite knowing tune advance. Nearby, Nita Berdine, high Transfiguration score, finished creating yet another pair green sunglasses, handed Adam Beringer, folded sunglasses tucking uniform pocket. Other soldiers already wearing green sunglasses, despite cloudy day.  You might guess sort incredibly complicated fascinating explanation behind this, would right.  Two days earlier Harry sitting amid bookcases comfy rocking-chair he'd obtained trunk's cavern level, pondering silently quiet span classes dinnertime, thinking power.  For sixteen Chaotics defeat twenty-eight Sunnies twenty-eight Dragons would need force amplifier. There limits could maneuver. There secret weapon invincible, least moderately unstoppable.  Muggle artifacts illegal Hogwarts's mock battles, banned Ministry edict. And trouble finding clever unusual spell army twice size could brute-force Finite almost anything tried. The Sunshine Regiment might missed tactic Transfigured chainmail, nobody would miss Professor Quirrell spelled out. And Finite Incantatem brute-force counterspell required least much magic spell canceled... which, severely outnumbered, made whole new order military challenge. The enemy could Finite anything tried, still enough magic left shields volleys Sleep Hexes.  Unless, somehow, could invoke potencies beyond ordinary strength first-year Hogwarts students, something powerful enemy Finite.  So Harry asked Neville he'd ever heard small, safe sacrificial rituals -  And then, screaming shouting subsided, Harry stopped trying argue Unbreakable Vows given whole thing clearly impossible public relations standpoint, Harry realized even needed go there. They taught invoke potencies far beyond strength ordinary Hogwarts classes.  Sometimes, even though looking straight something, realize looking happened ask exactly right question.  Defense. Charms. Transfiguration. Potions. History Magic. Astronomy. Broomstick Flying. Herbology...  "Foe!" screamed voice above.   It good thing Neville Longbottom tiniest idea grandmother watching; would've self-conscious screaming scary battlecries top lungs casting Luminos every three seconds rocketed dense forest trees, hot tail Gregory Goyle.  ("But -" Augusta Longbottom said, expression showing almost much astonishment worry. "But Neville afraid heights!")  ("Not fears last," said Amelia Bones. The old witch favoring great screen measuring gaze. "Or perhaps found courage. It much same, end.")  A glimmer red -  Neville dodged, nearly tree dodge; Neville somehow also managed dodge almost branches smacked face.  Now Mr. Goyle's broomstick pulling further away - even though two riding exactly broomstick Mr. Goyle weighed more, somehow Neville still falling behind. So Neville slowed down, pulled back, angled forest began accelerate back toward Chaos Legion still marched.  Twenty seconds later - long chase, exciting one - Neville back among fellow Chaotics, dismounted broom walk ground little bit.  "Neville -" said General Potter. Harry's voice little distant, walked carefully steadily forest, wand still applied almost-finished Form object slowly Transfiguring. Beside him, Blaise Zabini, working smaller version Transfiguration, looked like shambling Inferi stumbled forward. "I told - Neville - -"  "Yes, I do," said Neville. He looked fingers grasped broomstick, saw hands, whole arms shaking. But unless anyone else Chaos practicing dueling hour day Mr. Diggory, practicing aim private another hour afterward, Neville probably best shot broomstick even taking account good flyer.  "Good show, Neville," Theodore said walking ahead all, leading Chaos Legion forward forest wearing undershirt.  (Augusta Longbottom Charles Nott exchanged brief astonished glances wrenched gazes away one another though stung.)  Neville took deep breaths, trying steady hands, trying think; Harry might good deep strategic thinking middle extended Transfiguration. "Lieutenant Nott, idea Dragon Army that? They lost broom -" The Dragons started combat feint provide distraction Mr. Goyle's approach forest; Neville realized two brooms attacking almost late. But Chaos Legion gotten pilot. That broomsticks usually attack armies met, meant whole army would concentrate fire broomstick. "And Dragons even get anyone, they?"  "Nope!" Tracey Davis said proudly. She marching General Potter's side, wand gripped low watchful eyes scanned surrounding forest. "I threw Prismatic Sphere like split second Mr. Goyle's hex got Zabini, way Mr. Goyle arm stretched I think planned knock General, too." The Slytherin witch smiled vicious confidence. "Mr. Goyle tried Breaking Drill Hex, learned dismay weak magic match newfound dark powers, hahahaha!"  Some Chaotics laughed her, queasy sensation starting Neville's stomach realized close Chaos Legion come complete disaster. If Mr. Goyle managed disrupt Transfigurations -   "Report!" snapped Dragon General, best conceal fatigue felt casting seventeen Locking Charms, yet come.  Beads sweat dotted Gregory's forehead. "The enemy got Dylan Vaughan," Gregory said formally. "Harry Potter Blaise Zabini Transfiguring something dark-grey roundish, I think finished looked like would big hollow, sort cauldron-shaped. Zabini's smaller Potter's. I get either disrupt Transfigurations, Tracey Davis blocked me. Neville Longbottom broomstick he's still terrible flyer aim really good."  Draco listened, frowning, glanced Padma Dean Thomas, shook heads, indicating also think might big grey shaped like cauldron.  "Anything else?" said Draco. If it, they'd lost broom nothing -  "The weird thing I saw," Gregory said, sounding puzzled, "was Chaotics wearing... sort like goggles?"  Draco thought this, noticing he'd stopped marching Dragon Army automatically stopped him.  "Was anything special goggles?" Draco said.  "Um..." Gregory said. "They were... greenish, maybe?"  "Okay," said Draco. Again without thinking, began walking Dragons followed. "Here's new strategy. We're going send eleven Dragons Chaos Legion, fourteen. That enough beat them, neutralize special advantage." It gamble, take gambles sometimes, wanted come first three-way battle.  "You figured Chaos's plan, General Malfoy?" said Mr. Thomas considerable surprise.  "What doing?" said Padma.  "I faintest idea," said Draco, smirk refined smugness. "We'll obvious thing."   Harry, finished cauldron, carefully scooping acorns container scouts searched nearby source water could used liquid base. They'd come across frequent sinkholes miniature creeks forest before, ought take long. Another scout brought straight stick would serve stirrer, Harry Transfigure one.  Sometimes, even though looking straight something, realize looking happened ask exactly right question...  How I invoke magical powers ought beyond reach first-year students?  There cautionary tale Potions Master told (with much sneers laughter make stupidity seem low-status instead daring romantic) second-year witch Beauxbatons who'd stolen extremely restricted expensive ingredients, tried brew Polyjuice could borrow form another girl purposes better left unmentioned. Only she'd managed contaminate potion cat hairs, instead seeking healer immediately, witch hidden bathroom, hoping effects would wear off; she'd finally found, late reverse transformation completely, condemning life despair sort cat-girl hybrid.  Harry realized meant instant thinking right question - implied young wizard witch could things Potions-Making even come close Charms. Polyjuice one potent potions known... made Polyjuice N.E.W.T.-level potion, apparently, required age enough magical power; difficult potion brew precisely happened screwed up.  Nobody army tried brewing potions then. But Professor Quirrell would let get away nearly anything, something could done real war. Cheating technique, Defense Professor lectured them. Or rather, cheating losers call technique, worth extra Quirrell points executed successfully. In principle, nothing unrealistic Transfiguring couple cauldrons brewing potions whatever came hand, enough time armies met.  So Harry retrieved copy Magical Drafts Potions, begun looking safe useful potion could brew minutes battle started - potion would win battle fast counterspells, produce spell effects strong first-years Finite.  Sometimes, even though looking straight something, realize looking happened ask exactly right question...  What potion I brew using components gathered ordinary forest?  Every recipe Magical Drafts Potions used least one ingredient magical plant animal. Which unfortunate, magical plants animals Forbidden Forest, safer lesser woods battles held.  Someone else might given point.  Harry turned pages one recipe another, skimming faster faster dawning realization, confirming already read seeing first time.  Every single Potions recipe seemed demand least one magical ingredient, true?  Charms required material components all; said words waved wand. Harry thinking Potions-Making essentially analogous: Instead spoken syllables triggering spell effect comprehensible reason, collected batch disgusting ingredients stirred four times clockwise, arbitrarily triggered spell effect.  In case, given potions used ordinary components like porcupine quills stewed slugs, expect see potions using ordinary components.  But instead every single recipe Magical Drafts Potions demanded least one component magical plant animal - ingredient like silk Acromantula petals Venus Fire Trap.  Sometimes, even though looking straight something, realize looking happened ask exactly right question...  If making potion like casting Charm, I fall exhaustion brewing draught powerful boil-curing?  The Friday last, Harry's double Potions class brewed potion boil-curing... although even trivial healing Charms, tried cast wand incantation, least fourth-year spells. And afterward, they'd felt way usually felt Potions class, namely, magically exhausted discernible degree.  Harry shut copy Magical Drafts Potions snap, rushed Ravenclaw common room. Harry found seventh-year Ravenclaw N.E.W.T. potions homework paid older boy Sickle borrow Moste Potente Potions five minutes; Harry wanted run way library find confirmation.  After skimming five recipes seventh-year book, Harry read sixth recipe, potion fire breathing, required Ashwinder eggs... book warned resulting fire could hotter magical fire spawned Ashwinder laid eggs.  Harry shouted "Eureka!" right middle Ravenclaw common room, severely rebuked nearby prefect, who'd thought Mr. Potter trying cast spell. Nobody wizarding world knew cared ancient Muggle named Archimedes, ur-physicist's realization water displaced bathtub would equal volume object entering bathtub...  Conservation laws. They'd critical insight Muggle discoveries Harry could easily count. In Muggle technology raise feather one meter ground without power coming somewhere. If looked molten lava spilling volcano asked heat came from, physicist would tell radioactive heavy metals center Earth's molten core. If asked energy power radioactivity came from, physicist would point era Earth formed, primordial supernova early days galaxy baked atomic nuclei heavier natural limit, supernova compressing protons neutrons tight unstable package yielded back supernova's energy split. A light bulb fueled electricity, fueled nuclear power plant, fueled supernova... You could play game way back Big Bang.  Magic appear work like this, put mildly. Magic's attitude toward laws like Conservation Energy somewhere giant extended middle finger, shrug total indifference. Aguamenti created water nothingness, far anyone knew; known lake whose water level went time. That simple fifth-year spell, considered impressive wizards, creating mere glass water seem amazing them. They wacky notion mass ought conserved, creating gram mass somehow equivalent creating 90,000,000,000,000 joules energy. There upper-year spell Harry run across whose literal incantation 'Arresto Momentum!' Harry asked momentum went anywhere else he'd gotten puzzled look. So Harry kept desperate eye kind conservation principle magic, anywhere...  ...and whole time right front every Potions class. Potions-Making create magic, preserved magic, every potion needed least one magical ingredient. And following instructions like 'stir four times counterclockwise clockwise' - Harry hypothesized - something like casting small spell reshaped magic ingredients. (And unbound physical form ingredients like porcupine quills dissolved smoothly drinkable liquid; Harry strongly suspected Muggle following exactly recipe would end nothing spiny mess.) That Potions-Making really was, art transforming existing magical essences. So little tired Potions class, much, empowering potions yourself, reshaping magic already there. And second-year witch could brew Polyjuice, least get close.  Harry kept scanning Moste Potente Potions, looking something might disprove shiny new theory. After five minutes he'd flipped older boy another Sickle, protests, kept going.  The potion giant strength required Re'em trample mashed Dugbogs stirred potion. It odd, Harry realized moment, crushed Dugbogs strong themselves, just... very, crushed Re'em got them.  Another recipe said 'touch forged bronze', i.e., grasp Knut pliers could skim potion's surface; dropped Knut way in, book warned, potion would instantly superheat boil cauldron.  Harry stared recipes warnings, forming second stranger hypothesis. Of course simple Potions-Making using magical potentials imbued ingredients, like Muggle cars fueled combustion potential gasoline. Magic would never sensible that...  And Harry gone Professor Flitwick - since want approach Professor Snape outside class - Harry told Professor Flitwick wanted invent new potion, knew ingredients ought potion do, know deduce required stirring pattern -  After Professor Flitwick stopped screaming horror running little circles, Professor McGonagall called ensuing fierce interrogation promise Harry case acceptable important reveal underlying theory, developed Harry made original magical discovery, rediscovered law ancient nobody knew first formulated it:  A potion spends invested creation ingredients.  The heat goblin forges cast bronze Knut, Re'em's strength crushed Dugbogs, magical fire spawned Ashwinder: potencies could recalled, unlocked, restructured spell-like process stirring ingredients exact patterns.  (From Muggle standpoint odd, deranged version thermodynamics invented someone thought life ought fair. From Muggle standpoint, heat expended forging Knut gone bronze, heat left dissipated environment, becoming permanently less available. Energy conserved, could neither created destroyed; entropy always increased. But wizards think way: perspective, put amount work making Knut, stood reason could get exactly work back out. Harry tried explain sounded bit odd raised Muggles, Professor McGonagall asked bemusedly Muggle perspective better wizarding one.)  The fundamental principle Potions-Making name standard phrasing, since might tempted write down.  And someone wise enough figure principle might read it.  And would start sorts bright ideas inventing new Potions.  And would turned catgirls.  It made clear Harry going sharing particular discovery Neville, Hermione either next armies' battle. Harry tried say something Hermione seeming really lately sort thing might cheer up. Professor McGonagall said flatly even think it, Professor Flitwick raised little hands made gesture snapping wand half.  Although two Professors kind enough suggest Mr. Potter thought knew potion's ingredients be, might able find already-existing recipe thing; Professor Flitwick mentioned several volumes Hogwarts library might useful...   The vast parchment-like screen showed aerial view forest, could barely make camouflaged forms three armies, split two groups each, converging fight three-way battle.  The benches Quidditch stadium rapidly filling easily bored sort spectator wanted final battle skip boring points along way. (If anything wrong Professor Quirrell's battles, widely agreed, spectacles last nearly long Quidditch matches, actually started. To Professor Quirrell replied only, Such real life, that.)  Within huge window - one window now, observing great height - vague collections tiny camouflaged forms grew closer.  Closer.  Almost touching -   The vast white parchment window showed first touch battle Sunshine Chaos, screaming mass running children smiley-faces upon breasts, charging forward Contego shields held high others shouting "Somnium!" -  Until one number shrieked "Prismatis!" terrified voice entire charge came sudden halt sparkling wall force appeared front them.  Tracey Davis walked behind trees.  "That's right," said Tracey, voice low grim leveled wand barrier. "You fear me. For I Tracey Davis, Darke Lady! That's Darke Lady spelled D-A-R-K-E, E!"  (Amelia Bones, Director Department Magical Law Enforcement, sending inquiring look Mr. Mrs. Davis, looked like would dearly preferred die spot.)  Behind Prismatic Barrier, kind hushed argument taking place among Sunshine Soldiers, one particular seemed getting scolded several others.  Then, moment later, Tracey flinched.  Susan Bones come front Sunshine contingent.  ("Goodness," said Augusta Longbottom. "What suppose grand-niece learning Hogwarts?")  ("I know," Amelia Bones said calmly, "but I shall owl Chocolate Frog instructions learn it.")  The Prismatic Barrier vanished.  The Sunshine Soldiers resumed charge forward.  Tracey yelled, voice high strain, "Inflammare!" Sunshine charge came another sudden halt line fire blazed half-dry grass, extending follow path Tracey's wand pointed it; instant later Susan Bones cried "Finite Incantatem!" flames dimmed, brightened, dimmed contest wills, soldiers raising wards aim Tracey; Neville Longbottom plunged shrieking sky.   One Dragon Warriors, Raymond Arnold, made hand-sign, pointing forward oblique left; sudden hushed hiss whispers among Dragon Army contingent quietly reoriented direction enemy. The Sunnies knew there, course armies knew; somehow, moment, become instinctively quiet.  The Dragons crept forward further, further, dull camouflaged forms Sunnies beginning appear among distant trees, still nobody spoke, nobody bellowed call charge.  Draco forefront soldiers, Vincent behind Padma shade back; three could take shock Sunshine's best, rest Dragon Army might stand chance.  Then Draco saw one Sunnie staring distance, vanguard army; staring look fury -  Across forest battleground, eyes met.  Draco fraction second wonder, back mind, Hermione Granger angry about, shout went armies; running forward charge, Granger direct collision course other.   The Chaotics appeared among trees, dropped trees, battle full force now, everyone firing every direction anything looked like enemy. Plus number Sunnies crying "Luminos!" Neville Longbottom Chaos Hufflepuff twisted rocketed air courses could described as, indeed, "chaotic" -  And happened, way happened one time twenty mock aerial combat, Neville Longbottom's broomstick glowed bright red beneath clenched hands.  It meant Longbottom game.  Then, Hogwarts stands, among watching crowds students, scream went -  Combat realism. It Professor Quirrell's one master rule. You could get away anything realistic, real life, soldier vanish broomstick got hit curse.  Neville falling toward ground screaming "Chaotic landing!" Chaotics wrenching attention away fights cast Hover Charm (and run time sitting ducks), almost everyone else stopping gape -  And Neville Longbottom slammed leaf-laden forest ground, landing one knee, one foot, hands, though kneeling knighted.  Everything stopped. Even Tracey Susan paused duel.  In stadium, crowd noises vanished.  There universal silence composed astonishment, concern, sheer dumbstruck gaping awe, everyone waited see would happen next.  And Neville Longbottom slowly rose feet, leveled wand, still hand, Sunshine Soldiers.  Though nobody battlefield heard it, large segment stadium audience begun chanting, steadily rising notes time word uttered, "DOOM DOOM DOOM DOOM DOOM", see think required musical accompaniment.  "The crowd cheering grandson," said Amelia Bones. The old witch favoring screen measuring look.  "So are," said Augusta Longbottom. "Some, I hear correctly, cheering, Our blood Neville! Our souls Neville!"  "Quite," said Amelia, taking sip teacup moments earlier. "It shows lad leadership potential."  "These cheers," continued Augusta, voice taking even stunned quality, "seem coming Hufflepuff benches."  "It House loyal, dear," said Amelia.  "Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore! What Merlin's name happening school?"  Lucius Malfoy watching screens ironic smile, fingers tapping armrest discernible pattern. "I know frightening, thought hidden plan behind this, thought not."  "Look!" cried Lord Greengrass. The dapper young man risen half chair, pointing finger screen. "There goes!"   "We'll take once," Daphne whispered. She knew fear-filled minutes real combat experience, handful times week, might enough match Neville's regular dueling practice Harry Cedric Diggory period. "He's much one us, us together - I'll use Charm, try stun -"  Hannah, beside her, nodded, screamed top lungs charged forward, Hover Charms two supporting Sunshine Soldiers moving faster making light feet, Daphne already crying "Tonare!" even Hannah kept huge Contego shield moving front them, brief extra lift leapt heads front screen soldiers landed front Neville hair billowing high around -  (Photographs strictly prohibited Hogwarts games, somehow moment still ended front page next day's Quibbler.)  - instant, fighting older bullies burned away slightest traces hesitation, Hannah fired first Sleep Hex Neville (she'd started incantation still air) even Daphne, concentrating speed force, slashed Ancient Blade thought Neville's thighs would dodged -  But Neville leapt up, sideways, leapt higher able go, glowing sword cut air beneath feet. Somehow Daphne realized meant, Neville still Chaotics Hovering him, time raise Blade head, Neville fell fast Blade smashed like hit Bludger. It knocked Daphne feet sent sprawling backward onto grass, hitting ground hard back. It might her, then, Neville landed hard gone knees pained gasp. And Neville could bring glowing Blade down, Hannah shouted "Somnium!" Neville lurched frantically backward - though course spell actually come Hannah's wand, Hufflepuff girl really fired fast - gave Daphne second scramble feet get hands around wand -   "Dear Merlin," said Lady Greengrass. Her voice seemed unsteady, aristocratic poise well-punctured. "My daughter fighting Charm Most Ancient Blade, first year. I never knew - possessed extraordinary talent -"  "Excellent blood," Charles Nott said approvingly, causing Augusta snort.  "My good Lady," said Professor Quirrell, sounding grave. "Do wrong daughter so. That mere talent see." His voice grew little dryer. "That happens young wizards witches put competitive efforts game which, unlike Quidditch Exploding Snap, involves - put bluntly - actual spellcasting."   "Expelliarmus!" shouted Draco, trying let voice crack simultaneously dodged blazing red stunbolt Hermione Granger fired him, muscles twisting need dodge wrong direction - she'd pointed left, mysterious twitch fired right -  Hermione dodged fast-moving dueling hex, cried hardly another moment's pause, "Steleus!", wide-angle Hex Draco avoid, managed point wand face cry "Quiescus!" sudden urge inhale could devolve sneezing fit would've ended battle.  Draco Malfoy already half-exhausted Locking Charms Transfigurations earlier, confusion beginning give way sense blood boiling, know Granger attacking angrily sudden, wanted fight he'd give one -  (The Dragons Sunnies stopping watch duel Generals, Dragons disciplined stop watch meant Sunnies go fighting too; gaping audience Hogwarts Quidditch stands distracted even Neville Daphne's spectacle, shifting eyes duel two Generals Malfoy Granger fired hex hex jinx jinx other, casting rapidly student year could managed, Dragon General's trained dueling dance matched Sunshine General's frantic energy, combat beginning resemble adult duel two magically powerful first-years resorted spells exotic usual Sleep Hex.)  - although, Draco beginning realize, Harry Professor Quirrell dismissed Miss Granger as much intent kill bowl wet grapes, they'd never seen angry.   Daphne lashed Ancient Blade, trying hit hard moving Blade fast possible, time Hannah cried "Somnium!" Neville leapt back again, another bluff Hannah moving fire real spell almost point-blank -  - Neville Longbottom exactly - would explain afterward - Cedric Diggory trained fighting Bellatrix Black, spin around kick Hannah really hard pit stomach.  The Hufflepuff girl made sad little sound, gasping cry pain, knocked feet hard shoe sinking abdomen force Neville's whole body behind it.  For instant battlefield stood still, everything halted except Hannah's falling form.  Then Neville's face turned absolute dismay lowered wand, Chaotic Lieutenant starting instinctively toward House-mate reached hand -  Even Hannah turned fall roll came wand raised shot him.  A fractional second later, Daphne, hesitated either, sank Most Ancient Blade squarely Neville's back, causing Chaotic Lieutenant's muscles jerk convulsively stunning magic discharging even Hannah's Sleep Hex took effect, last scion Longbottom sprawled still ground look total surprise frozen face.   "Today Mr. Longbottom learned valuable lesson feelings pity remorse," said Professor Quirrell.  "And chivalry," said Amelia, sipping tea again.   "Are right?" whispered Daphne, stood protectively Hannah lay ground clutching stomach. The girl give anything back reply except retching sounds sounded like Hannah trying throw trying cry.  Somehow, even though might good tactics - would've better Hannah hexed outright, soldiers tied protecting - number Sunnies seemed standing front Hannah wands clutched tightly, staring angrily Chaotics. Someone thrown Prismatic barrier two groups, Daphne see who.  And reason Chaotics seem pressing attack. Even Tracey completely dropped grim look face shifting weight nervously one foot another, though trouble remembering side -  "Hold!" shouted voice. "Hold battle!"  There much battle going anyway, held.  General Potter, looking every inch Boy-Who-Lived, strode trees something large camouflage-cloth-covered held one arm.  "Is Miss Abbott breathing right?" General Potter yelled.  Daphne look back. She trust trap - absolutely certain Chaotics took opportunity attack, Professor Quirrell would rule legal also award extra points afterward. But Daphne could hear answer well enough ears, like Hannah trying breathe quietly, said, "Sort of."  "She get someone use healing Charms," Harry said. "Just case broke something."  From behind Daphne, small gasping voice said, "I - - still - fight -"  "Miss Abbott, -" Harry said, sound behind Daphne someone collapsing back grass trying failing get feet. Everyone winced, Daphne turn back Harry.  "Why teachers stopped battle?" said Susan, voice angry.  "I expect Miss Abbott danger permanent damage Professor Quirrell thinks we're learning valuable lessons," Harry said hard voice. "Look, Miss Abbott, go, Tracey also retire battle. You already outnumber us, that's good deal side. Please take it."  "Hannah, go!" said Daphne. "I mean, say out!"  When Daphne glanced back saw Hannah shaking head, still curled ball grass.  "Oh, screw this," said Harry. "Chaotics! The faster stun them, faster here! We're going quickly, even take casualties! End truce! TUNAFISH!"  Daphne's political hindbrain instant admire Harry's words made Chaotics good guys, almost perfect unison, Chaotics plunging hands pockets uniforms drawing green sunglasses unfamiliar style. Not like anything would wear beach, like goggles advanced Potions -  Then Daphne realized happen snapped hand shield eyes, Harry ripped cloth cauldron.  The fluid spilled forth Harry Potter threw cauldron's contents air bright seen, brilliant imagined, incandescent like Sun magnified dozen times -  (which exactly was)  (the sunlight invested create acorns, bright energy fueled tree rising bare dirt)  (blazing searing purple, color mixed blue red wavelengths chlorophyll absorbed)  (with almost none green wavelengths chlorophyll reflected create green color leaves)  (which color Chaos Legion's sunglasses, made pass green wavelengths, blocking red blue, reducing even incandescent purple glare something bearable)  - violet light blazed on, Daphne tried dropping arm eyes found look directly anything, even secondhand purple glare bright squint; time cry one Finite Incantatem, work, Sleep Hex took her.  What left battle take long that.   "NOW!" bellowed Blaise Zabini, formerly Sunshine, commanding detachment Chaos Legionnaires. "I mean, TUNAFISH!" The Slytherin boy's hand grasped cloth shielding cauldron triggering touch daylight, already beginning move aside.  "NOW!" bellowed Dean Thomas, formerly Chaos, commanding consignment Dragon Warriors. "DO WHATEVER THEY DO!"  The Chaotics Zabini's detachment plunged hands uniform pockets, came forth bearing green sunglasses -  - action almost perfectly mirrored Dean Dragon Warriors, drew forth green-colored Potions goggles, quickly drew straps heads, even Chaotics put sunglasses violet incandescence blasted forth.  (As General Malfoy explained, Mr. Goyle reported Chaos Legion wearing green-colored Potions goggles, know Transfigure copies.)  "THAT'S CHEATING!" shrieked Blaise Zabini.  "THAT'S TECHNIQUE!" Dean yelled back. "DRAGONS, CHARGE!"  ("Pardon me," Lady Greengrass said. "Could stop laughing like that, Mr. Quirrell? It's unnerving.")  "FINITE THEIR GOGGLES!" shouted Blaise Zabini, two armies ran headlong toward omnipresent eye-searing purple glare. "WE CAN STILL WIN!"  "YOU HEARD HIM!" bellowed Dean. "GET THEIR GLASSES!"  Blaise Zabini's reply anything articulate.  That battle went lot longer.   "Stupefy!" shrieked Sunshine General.  Draco dodge, counter, enough energy left either, could whip left hand position hope -  The red stunbolt dissipated Draco's Colloportused glove, he'd Transfigured spell-locked hand rest Dragon Army. It saving now, shield.  It time counterattack, Draco could catch breath, two danced backward forward beneath trees never-ending movements duel. Across him, General Granger panting hard, young girl's face glistening sweat like dew, chestnut hair wetted brown plaits. Her camouflage uniform stained damp spots, shoulders visibly trembling exhaustion, wand still steel-steady stayed level Draco motion. Her eyes glaring, cheeks flushed rage.  So, little girl, why're pretending fight like grownup today?  The taunt came mind, really think needed Granger angrier; instead Draco said - though could hear voice cracking - "Any reason feeling mad me, Granger?"  The girl gasping breath herself, voice wobbling spoke. "I know to," said Hermione Granger, voice rising. "I know Snape to, Malfoy, I know who's behind it!"  "Huh?" Draco said without even thinking it.  That seemed increase Granger's fury, fingers whitened wand held leveled him.  And Draco got it, boiled blood veins. Even thought secretly plotting -  "You too?" Draco yelled. "I helped you, bucktoothed bint! You, you, you," - stuttering past Dark curses came mind found something could actually cast - "DENSAUGEO!"  But Granger flashed whirled around Tooth-Lengthening Hex, wand came around leveled almost point-blank range, even Draco brought left hand like shield, placing magic-locked glove whatever fire, Sunshine General's voice rose shriek audible across whole battleground -  "ALOHOMORA!"  Time paused.  But didn't.  Instead padlocked glove Draco's hand flashed briefly grey, padlock clicked fell off.  Just like that.  Just like that.  The screens showed clearly, entire watching Hogwarts stadium.  And bone-dead-silent hush fell every bench every bleacher said everyone understood quite clearly meant, scion House Malfoy magic overcome Muggleborn.  Hermione Granger pause fight, gave sign even knew she'd done; instead foot snapped Muggle-style kick knocked Draco's wand cleanly hand, shocked mind body moving little slowly. Draco dove wand, scrabbling frantically ground, behind girl's cracking voice said "Somnium!" Draco Malfoy fell rise again.  There another moment frozen silence. The Sunshine General wobbling feet, looking like might faint.  Then Dragon Warriors screamed top lungs charged forward avenge fallen commander.   Mr. Mrs. Davis shaking stood comfortable chairs faculty Quidditch box; quite clutch walking, held hands tightly, pretending hard invisible. If they'd children young enough accidental magic probably would've spontaneously Disillusioned themselves.  The elderly Charles Nott said nothing stood chair. The scarred Lord Jugson said nothing, stood chair.  Lucius Malfoy said nothing stood.  All three turned without pause strode toward stairwell elevated bleachers, moving eerie unison like Auror trio -  "Lord Malfoy," Defense Professor said mild tones. That man still seated chair, looking upon parchment-like screens, arms limp side, though reason feel like moving.  The white-haired man halted reaching exit archway, elderly man scarred man halted well, flanking him. Lord Malfoy's head turned, slightly form acknowledgement, Defense Professor's direction.  "Your son performed exceptionally well today," said Professor Quirrell. "I must confess I underestimated him. And earned army's loyalty, witnessed." Still mild, Defense Professor's voice. "Speaking son's teacher, opinion benefit interfere -"  Lord Malfoy compatriots vanished stairs.  "A fine try, Quirinus," Dumbledore said quietly. The old wizard's face showed small lines worry; risen seat either, staring parchment screens though still active. "Do think listen?"  The Defense Professor's shoulders twitched slight shrug, movement they'd shown since battle ended.  "Well," said Lady Greengrass, rose cracked knuckles, stretching, husband silent beside her. "I must say, quite... interesting..."  Amelia Bones risen cushioned seat without fuss. "Interesting indeed," said Director Bones. "I confess, I find disturbed skill children fighting one another."  "The skill?" Lord Greengrass said. "Their spells seem impressive me. Except Daphne's, course."  The old witch move eyes gazing Defense Professor's balding head. "The Stunning Hex first-year spell, Lord Greengrass, skill I mind. They supported simple spells, reacted speed surprises..." The Director DMLE paused, though searching words mere civilian could understand. "In midst battle," said finally, "with spells flying every direction... children seemed quite home."  "Indeed, Director Bones," said Defense Professor. "Some arts best begun youth."  The old witch's eyes narrowed. "You readying become military force, Professor. To end?"  "Now hold on!" interjected Lord Greengrass. "There's plenty schools teach dueling first year!"  "Dueling?" said Defense Professor. From behind visible pale face smiling. "That nothing, Lord Greengrass, students learned. They learned hesitate face ambushes greater foes. They learned adapt combat conditions change change again. They learned protect allies, protect more valuable, abandon pieces cannot rescued. They learned survive must follow orders. Some even learned little creativity. Oh, no, Lord Greengrass, wizards hide manors wait protected, next threat comes. They know know fight."  Augusta Longbottom loudly clapped hands together three times.   We won.  It first thing Draco heard woke battlefield, Padma telling soldiers rallied fell. How, thanks Dragon General's foresight, Mr. Thomas led detachment victory Chaos. How General Potter defeated portion Sunshine Regiment clashed him. How Mr. Thomas's Dragon Warriors rejoined main body soldiers bearing goggles sunglasses defeated Chaotics. How, moments later, General Potter's remaining contingent attacked armies potion emitted searing purple light. But Dragon held numerical advantage Sunshine Chaos both, enough sunglasses warriors; Padma managed lead inherited army victory.  From light Padma's eyes arrogant smile would done proud Malfoy, expecting congratulations. Draco managed grit form praise clenched teeth, said afterward was. The foreign-born witch, appeared, idea what'd happened, meant.  I lost.  The Dragons trudged back Hogwarts beneath gray skies, cold droplets landing heavy Draco's skin, one one. While he'd stunned, begun, long-promised rain finally beginning fall. There one option left Draco now. A forced move, Mr. MacNair, who'd taught Draco chess, would termed it. Harry Potter probably like it, really love Granger way everyone said. But forced move, Mr. MacNair defined it, one needed make wanted game continue all.  It kept playing Draco's mind, over again, even walked like automaton massive portals Hogwarts, sent away Vincent Gregory two sharp words, became alone within private bedroom, sitting bed, staring wall desk. Filling mind like Dementor locked memory.  The grey flash coming glove, lock clicking falling away -  Draco knew, knew he'd done wrong. He'd tired casting twenty-seven Locking Charms Dragon Warriors. Less minute enough time recover spell. And he'd cast Colloportus padlocked glove, cast spell, put strength bind stronger Harry Potter Hermione Granger could undo.  But nobody going believe that, even true. Even Slytherin, nobody would believe that. It sounded like excuse, excuse anyone would hear.  Granger whirled spun screamed 'ALOHOMORA!' -  Draco's mind kept playing over resentment built. He'd helped Granger - cooperated banning traitors - held hand she'd dangled roof - stopped riot breaking around Great Hall - idea he'd risked, he'd probably already lost, meant heir House Malfoy mudblood -  And one move left, thing forced move make it, even meant getting detention losing House points. Professor Snape would certainly understand limits (Father warned him) Snape would overlook.  Challenge Granger wizard's duel, open defiance Hogwarts regulations. Attack outright, tried refuse. Defeat one-on-one, public, clever dueling technique, overpowering magic. Beat solidly, completely, crush utterly Dark Lord crushed enemies. Make absolutely clear everyone, nobody could possibly doubt, Draco exhausted casting spell many times. Prove Malfoy blood stronger mudblood's -  Only not, Harry Potter's voice whispered inside Draco's mind. It's easy forget what's really true, Draco, start trying win politics. But reality there's one thing makes wizard, remember?  Draco knew, then, knew reason disquiet back mind, stared blank wall desk contemplating forced move. It simple - one move, thing make - -  Granger whirling, spinning, sweat-dampened hair flying around her, bolts flying wand fast own, jinx counter-jinx, glowing bats flying face, look fury Granger's eyes -  There'd part admiring that, gone wrong, admiring Granger's fury power; part exulted first real fight he'd ever in, against...  ...his first equal opponent.  If challenged Granger, lost...  It ought possible, Draco gotten wand two full years anyone else Hogwarts class.  Only reason usually bother giving wands nine-year-olds. Age counted too, long held wand. Granger's birthday days year, Harry bought pouch. That meant twelve now, she'd twelve almost since start Hogwarts. And truth was, Draco practicing much outside class, probably nearly much Hermione Granger Ravenclaw. Draco thought needed practice stay ahead...  And Granger exhausted too, whispered Voice Contrary Evidence inside him. Granger must exhausted Stunning Hexes, even state she'd able undo Locking Charm.  And Draco could afford challenge Granger publicly, one-on-one excuses, lose.  Draco knew supposed sort situation. You supposed cheat. But anyone discovered Draco cheating, would disastrous, perfect blackmail material even never got publicly, Slytherins watching would know that, they'd looking...  And then, watching, would seen Draco Malfoy get bed, go desk, take sheet finest sheepskin parchment, pearl-carven inkwell, filled greenish-silver ink made true silver crushed emeralds. From great trunk bed's foot, Slytherin drew forth book bound also silver emeralds, entitled The Etiquette Houses Britain. And new, clean quill, Draco Malfoy began write, frequently looking book lay open reference. There grim smile boy's face, making young Malfoy look much like father, carefully drew letter though separate artwork.  From Draco, son Lucius son Abraxis Lords Noble Most Ancient House Malfoy, son also Narcissa daughter Druella Lady Noble Most Ancient House Black, scion heir Noble Most Ancient House Malfoy:  To Hermione, first Granger:  (That form might meant sound polite, long ago invented; nowadays, centuries used address mudbloods, carried lovely tinge refined venom.)

Draco flipped book page standard formulae, found one seemed appropriate.

That night dinnertime, Susan Bones came Harry Potter told thought Draco Malfoy going carry plot Hermione soon. She warning members S.P.H.E.W., she'd warned Professor Sprout, she'd warned Professor Flitwick, going send letter Aunt tonight, warning Harry Potter, too. Only quite talk Padma - Susan said, looking serious - Padma feeling torn loyalty Hermione loyalty General.  Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres, point feeling frustrated entire situation anything really productive, snapped yes, knew something done.  After Susan Bones left, Harry looked end Ravenclaw table, Hermione sat away Padma Anthony friends.  But Hermione look like mood somebody going bothering would taken well.  Later, looking backward, Harry would think how, SF fantasy novels, people always made big, important choices big, important reasons. Hari Seldon built Foundation rebuild ashes Galactic Empire, rather would look important could charge research group. Raistlin Majere severed ties brother wanted become god, incompetent personal relationships unwilling take advice better. Frodo Baggins taken Ring hero wanted save Middle-Earth, would've awkward to. If anyone ever wrote true history world - anyone ever could would - probably 97% key moments Fate would turn constructed lies tissue paper trivial little thoughts somebody could've easily thought differently.  Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres looked Hermione Granger, she'd sat end table, felt sense reluctance bother looked like already bad mood.  So Harry thought probably made sense talk Draco Malfoy first, could absolutely positively definitely assure Hermione Draco really plotting her.  And later dinner, Harry went Slytherin basement told Vincent boss ain't disturbed... Harry thought maybe see Hermione would talk right away. That get started unraveling whole mess raveled further. Harry wondered might procrastinating, mind found clever excuse put something unenjoyable-but-necessary.  He actually thought that.  And Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres decided he'd talk Draco Malfoy next morning instead, Sunday breakfast, talk Hermione.  Human beings sort thing time.   It Sunday morning, 5th April, 1992, simulated sky Great Hall Hogwarts showed great torrents rain pouring density lightning flashes diminished scattered small pulses white light sometimes transformed House tables, paling faces making students appear briefly ghosts.  Harry sat Ravenclaw table, wearily eating waffle, waiting Draco make appearance could get started sorting whole thing out. There Quibbler passed around somehow ended Hannah Daphne front page, gotten place yet.  A minutes later Harry finished eating waffle, looked around see Draco arrived yet breakfast Slytherin table.  It odd.  Draco Malfoy almost never late.  Since Harry looking direction Slytherin table, see Hermione Granger entering huge doors Great Hall. Thus rather startled turned back discovered Hermione sitting directly beside Ravenclaw table, not-done week.  "Hi, Harry," Hermione said, voice sounding almost exactly normal. She started put toast plate selection healthy fruits vegetables. "How you?"  "Within one standard deviation peculiar little average," Harry automatically replied. "How doing? Did sleep okay?"  There dark bags Hermione Granger's eyes.  "Why, yes, I'm fine," said Hermione Granger.  "Um," Harry said. He took slice pie onto plate (as brain occupied things, Harry's hand simply took tastiest thing within range, without evaluating complex concepts like whether ready eat dessert). "Um, Hermione, I'm going need talk later today, okay?"  "Sure," said Hermione. "Why be?"  "Because -" Harry said. "I mean - I - last days -"  Shut up, suggested internal part Harry seemed recently allocated governing Hermione-related issues.  Hermione Granger look like paying much attention case. She stared plate, then, ten seconds awkward silence, began eat tomato slices, one another, without pause.  Harry looked away began eat slice pie which, discovered, somehow materialized plate.  "So!" Hermione Granger suddenly said she'd polished plate silence. "Anything happening today?"  "Um..." Harry said. He looked around frantically, though find something-happening could use conversational fodder.  And Harry one first see it, wordlessly point, although sudden swell whispers swept Great Hall showed number people seen too.  The distinctive crimson tinge robes would recognizable anywhere, still took Harry's brain moments place faces. An Asianish-looking man, solemn, today looking rather grim. A man piercing gaze swept room, long black hair waving behind ponytail. A man thin pale unshaven, face blank like stone. It took Harry moment place faces, remember names, long-ago day January Dementor come Hogwarts: Komodo, Butnaru, Goryanof.  "An Auror trio?" Hermione said strange bright voice. "Why, I wonder they'd here."  Dumbledore company well, looking worried Harry ever seen him; moment's pause old wizard's eyes scanned Great Hall students whispering breakfasts, pointed -  - straight Harry.  "Oh, what," Harry said breath. His inward thoughts lot panicked that, wondered frantically anyone connected Azkaban breakout somehow. He looked Head Table, trying make glance casual, realized Professor Quirrell nowhere seen, morning -  The Aurors swept toward swift strides, Auror Goryanof approaching side Ravenclaw table though block escape direction, Auror Komodo Auror Butnaru approaching Harry's side, Headmaster following straight Komodo's heels.  All conversation everywhere ground utter silence.  The Aurors reached Harry's place table, surrounding three angles.  "Yes?" Harry said, normally could. "What it?"  "Hermione Granger," Auror Komodo said toneless voice, "you arrest attempted murder Draco Malfoy."   Chapter 79: Taboo Tradeoffs, Pt 1  "Hermione Granger," Auror Komodo said toneless voice, "you arrest attempted murder Draco Malfoy."  The words dropped Harry's consciousness shattered thoughts hundred shards incredulity, shock adrenaline running much confusion -  "She -" Harry said. "She - - WHAT?"  The Aurors paying attention him. Komodo spoke again, still colorless voice. "Mr. Malfoy regained consciousness St. Mungo's named you, Hermione Granger, assaulter. He repeated accusations two drops Veritaserum. The Blood-Cooling Charm cast upon Mr. Malfoy would killed found treated, must presumed known fatal curse. I therefore arrest upon serious charge attempted murder taken Ministry custody interrogated three drops Veritaserum -"  "Are mad?" words burst Harry's mouth, shoved Ravenclaw table, instant Auror Butnaru's hand clamped hard upon shoulder. Harry ignored it. "That's Hermione Granger trying arrest, nicest girl Ravenclaw, helps Hufflepuffs homework, she'd die tried kill anyone -"  Hermione Granger's face crumpled. "I it," whispered tiny voice. "It me."  Another huge rock fell Harry's thoughts crushed fragile order, bursting fragments comprehension dust.  Dumbledore's face seemed aged decades course seconds. "Why, Miss Granger?" Dumbledore said, voice barely whisper. "Why would thing?"  "I'm," Hermione said, "I'm, I'm - sorry - I know I -" She seemed collapse herself, voice formed nothing sobs, words could made were, "I thought - killed - sorry -"  And Harry said something, done something, jumped seat stunned three Aurors gone incredibly clever next move, twice-shattered fragments thought processes could yield output. Butnaru's hand pushed Harry gently firmly back seat Harry found stuck like he'd glued, tried grab wand Finite come pocket, three Aurors Dumbledore escorted Hermione Great Hall amid rising storm outcries doors began swing shut behind - nothing made sense, surreal beyond reckoning, like he'd transported alternate universe, Harry's mind flashed back another day confusion moment desperate inspiration finally realized Weasley twins done Rita Skeeter, voice rose scream, "HERMIONE YOU DIDN'T DO IT YOU'VE BEEN FALSE-MEMORY-CHARMED!"  But doors already shut.   Minerva possibly stood still, paced back forth Headmaster's office, back mind half-expecting Severus Harry tell shut sit down, neither Potions Master Boy-Who-Lived seemed much concerned her, gazes focused Albus Dumbledore emerged Floo. There sounds background nobody heard. Severus seemed passionless ever, sitting small cushioned chair beside Headmaster's desk. The old wizard stood terrible upright still-burning fireplace, robed black like starless night, radiating power dismay. All thoughts utter confusion horror. Harry Potter sat wooden stool fingers gripping seat, eyes fury freezing ice.  At 6:33am, Quirinus Quirrell Flooed St. Mungo's office immediate pickup Draco Malfoy. Professor Quirrell found Mr. Malfoy trophy room Hogwarts, verge death continuing effects Blood-Cooling Charm slowly lowering body temperature. Professor Quirrell immediately dispelled Charm, cast stabilizing spells Mr. Malfoy, levitated office Floo St. Mungo's treatment. After this, Professor Quirrell informed Headmaster, stating facts briefly vanishing Floo; Aurors, notified St. Mungo's, demanded presence questioning.  The clear intent Blood-Cooling Charm kill Draco Malfoy slowly wards Hogwarts, set detect sudden injury, would trigger. Under interrogation, Professor Quirrell told Aurors cast several tracking Charms upon Mr. Malfoy's person January, shortly Mr. Malfoy's return Hogwarts Yuletime break. Professor Quirrell cast tracking Charms learned person motive harm Mr. Malfoy. Professor Quirrell refused identify person. The tracking Charms Professor Quirrell cast triggered Mr. Malfoy's health falling absolute level, rather sudden changes, therefore alerted Professor Quirrell Mr. Malfoy died.  Two drops Veritaserum, sufficient prevent Mr. Malfoy withholding meliorating moderating information statements, shown Mr. Malfoy - legally laws Noble Houses, illegally regulations Hogwarts - challenged Hermione Granger duel. Mr. Malfoy duel then, left, attacked behind Miss Granger Stunning Hex. After Mr. Malfoy knew nothing.  Three drops Veritaserum, requiring volunteer relevant information, caused Hermione Granger confess stunned Draco Malfoy behind, then, fit anger, cast Blood-Cooling Charm him, deliberate intention killing slowly enough evade identification Hogwarts wards, whose workings read Hogwarts: A History. She horrified upon awakening next morning, told anyone she'd done, believing Draco Malfoy already dead - certainly would seven hours, body's magic resisting effects Blood-Cooling Charm.  "Her trial," said Albus Dumbledore, "is set tomorrow noon."  "What?" word burst Harry Potter. The Boy-Who-Lived rise chair, Minerva saw fingers whiten gripped wooden seat beneath him. "That's insane! You can't police investigation one day -"  The Potions Master raised voice. "This Muggle Britain, Mr. Potter!" Severus's face expressionless ever, bite voice sharp. "The Aurors accusation Veritaserum confession Veritaserum. So far concerned, investigation done."  "Not quite," said Dumbledore, Harry seemed ready explode. "I insisted Amelia matter given utmost scrutiny. Unfortunately, ill-fated duel midnight -"  "Supposed duel," Harry said sharply.  "As supposed duel midnight - yes, quite right, Harry - beyond range Time-Turner -"  "Also supposedly," Boy-Who-Lived said coldly. "And rather suspiciously, since alleged murder suspect know Time-Turners. I hope invisible Auror immediately sent back time far possible observe -"  Dumbledore inclined head. "I went myself, Harry, moment I heard. But time I reached trophy room, Mr. Malfoy already unconscious Miss Granger gone -"  "No," said Harry Potter. "You reached trophy room saw Draco unconscious. That observed, Headmaster. You observe Hermione there, watch leave. Let us distinguish observation inference." The boy's head turned look her. "Imperius, Obliviation, False Memory Charm, Legilimency. Professor McGonagall, I leaving mind-affecting spell could made Hermione make believe she'd done it?"  "The Confundus Charm," said. And Dark Arts never study, knew - "And certain Dark rituals. But none could performed Hogwarts without alarm."  The boy nodded, eyes still directly addressing her. "Which spells detected? Which would Aurors try detect?"  "The Confundus Charm would wear hours," said, moment gather thoughts. "Miss Granger would remember Imperius. Obliviation cannot detected known means, Professor could cast spell upon student without alarm Hogwarts wards. Legilimency - detected another Legilimens, I think -"  "I requested Miss Granger examined court Legilimens," said Dumbledore. "The examination showed -"  "Do trust him?" said Harry.  "Her," said Dumbledore. "Sophie McJorgenson, I remember honest student Ravenclaw, bound Unbreakable Vow tell truth sees -"  "Could someone else Polyjuiced her?" Harry Potter interrupted again. "What observe, Headmaster?"  Albus said heavily, "A person looked like Madam McJorgenson told us single Legilimens lightly touched Miss Granger's mind months ago. That January, Harry, I communicated Miss Granger matter certain Dementor. That expected; I expect rest Sophie found." The old wizard turned gaze Floo fire, letting orange flames reflect face. "As say, Harry, False Memory Charm one possibility; are, cast perfectly, indistinguishable true memory -"  "That surprise me," Harry interrupted. "Studies show human memories less rewritten every time remember -"  "Harry," Minerva said softly, boy's mouth clamped shut.  The old wizard continued. "- False Memory Charm quality requires much time create true memory. Creating detailed memory ten minutes would ten minutes' work. And according court Legilimens," Albus's face seemed tired lined before, "Miss Granger obsessing Mr. Malfoy since day Severus... yelled her. She thinking Mr. Malfoy might league Professor Snape, might planning harm harm Harry - imagining hours every day - would impossible create false memories much time."  "The appearance insanity..." Severus murmured softly, though speaking himself. "Could natural? No, disastrous pure accident; convenient someone, I doubt. A Muggle drug, perhaps? But would enough - Miss Granger's madness would guided -"  "Ah!" Harry said suddenly. "I get now. The first False Memory Charm cast Hermione Professor Snape yelled her, showed, say, Draco Professor Snape plotting kill her. Then last night False Memory removed Obliviation, leaving behind memories obsessing Draco apparent reason, time Draco given false memories duel."  Minerva blinked startlement. It would thousand years thought possibility.  The Potions Master frowning thoughtfully, eyes intent. "The reaction False Memory Charm hard predict advance, Mr. Potter, without Legilimency. The subjects always act expected, first remember false memories. It would risky ploy. But I suppose one way Professor Quirrell could done it."  "Professor Quirrell?" said Harry. "What motive -"  The Potions Master said dryly, "The Defense Professor always suspect, Mr. Potter. You notice trend, given time."  Albus raised hand, silencing gesture, heads turned look him. "But case another suspect," Albus said quietly. "Voldemort."  That deadliest unspeakable words seemed echo around room, canceling heat orange flames fireplace.  "I know," old wizard said slowly, "I know little, methods Voldemort's immortality. He searched books I did, I think. All I could find ancient tales, scattered across many volumes remove. But find truth among many stories also wizard's mastery, I endeavored do. There human sacrifice, murder, I certain; committed coldest blood, victim dying horror. And old, old tales wizards possessed, mad deeds, claiming names Dark Lords thought defeated; usually device, Dark Lord, wield..." Albus looked Harry, ancient eyes searching younger. "I think, Harry - though call inference - act murder splits soul. That ritual blackest horror, torn fragment soul chained world. To material thing world. Which must be, becomes, device power."  Horcrux. The terrible name echoed Minerva's mind, though seemed - reason know - Albus would speak word front Harry.  "And therefore," old wizard finished quietly, "the remainder soul bound chained part, lingering body destroyed. A sad painful existence, I think would be; less spirit, less meanest ghost..." The old wizard's eyes locked Harry, gazed back eyes narrowed. "It would take time mutilated soul regain mockery life. That ten-year reprieve, I believe; Voldemort return once. But time... revenant would become capable rising again." The old wizard spoke grim precision. "It clear, stories, Dark Lords return possessing another's form, wield lesser magics knew. I think Voldemort would satisfied that. He would take avenue life. But Voldemort Slytherin Salazar, grasping every opportunity. He would use pitiful state, use power possession, reason. If could benefit another's... inexplicable fury." Albus's voice fallen almost whisper. "That I suspect happened Miss Granger."  Minerva's throat dry. "He's here," gasped. "Here, Hogwarts -"  Then stopped, reason Voldemort come Hogwarts -  The old wizard glanced briefly, said, still whisper, "I sorry, Minerva, right."  Harry's voice edged. "Right what?"  "Voldemort's strongest avenue life," Dumbledore said heavily. "The desirable road him, would rise greater terrible ever before. It guarded here, within castle -"  "Excuse me," Harry said politely. "Are stupid?"  "Harry," said, force voice.  "I mean, maybe noticed this, Headmaster Dumbledore, castle full CHILDREN -"  "I choice!" bellowed Dumbledore. The blue eyes blazing now, beneath half-moon spectacles. "I it, thing Voldemort desires. It belongs another, held consent! I asked could kept Department Mysteries. But would permit - said must within wards Hogwarts, place Founders' protection -" Dumbledore passed hand across forehead. "No," old wizard said quieter voice. "I cannot pass blame him. He right. There much power thing, much men desire. I agreed trap laid behind wards Hogwarts, place power." The old wizard bowed head. "I knew Voldemort would worm way somehow, planned trap him. I think - I dream - would tarry enemy fortress one minute longer must."  "But," said Severus puzzlement, "what would Dark Lord possibly gain killing Lucius's heir?"  "Point order," Harry Potter said, hard edge voice. "The motives whoever's behind primary issue. Our top priority point innocent Hogwarts student trouble!"  The green eyes locked blue, Albus Dumbledore gazed back Boy-Who-Lived -  "Quite right, Mr. Potter," Minerva said, even thought it, words seemed pop lips. "Albus, watching Miss Granger now?"  "Professor Flitwick gone her," Headmaster said.  "She needs lawyer," Harry said. "Anyone blurts 'I it' police -"  "Unfortunately," Minerva said, tone taking Professor McGonagall's sternness without thinking, "I doubt lawyer use Miss Granger point, Mr. Potter. She face judgment Wizengamot, would exceedingly unlikely free technicality."  Harry looking utterly incredulous expression, though suggesting Hermione Granger need lawyer akin suggesting set fire.  "She correct, Mr. Potter," Severus said quietly. "Few court processes country involve lawyers."  Harry lifted glasses rubbed eyes, briefly. "Fine. How get Hermione hook, exactly? I suppose much hope lawyers gone, judges understand concept 'common sense' 'prior probability' well enough realize twelve-year-old girls basically never commit cold-blooded murders?"  "It Wizengamot faces," said Severus. "The oldest Noble Houses, certain wizards influence." Severus's face twisted something approaching customary sarcasm. "As showing common sense - might well expect make bacon sandwich, Potter."  Harry nodded, mouth set. "Exactly sort penalty Hermione facing? Snapped wand expulsion -"  "No," Severus said. "Nothing light. Are willfully misunderstanding, Potter? She facing Wizengamot. There set penalty. There vote."  Harry Potter murmured, "The rule law, complex times, proved deficient; much prefer rule men, vastly efficient... There's constraining legal rules all, then?"  Light glinted old wizard's half-moon glasses; spoke carefully, without anger. "Legally, Harry, dealing blood debt Hermione Granger House Malfoy. The Lord Malfoy proposes repayment debt, Wizengamot votes proposal. That all."  "But..." Harry said slowly. "Lucius Sorted Slytherin, he's got realize Hermione pawn. Not one actually angry at. Right?"  "No, Harry Potter," Albus Dumbledore said heavily. "That wish Lucius Malfoy would think. Lucius Malfoy himself... share desire think way."  Harry gazed Headmaster, eyes growing colder, time Minerva clamp harder emotions, stop pacing try breathe. She'd trying think it, trying turn thoughts away it, knew. She'd known since instant she'd heard. She could see Albus's eyes -  "Is facing capital punishment?" Harry said quietly, chills went way Minerva's spine undertones voice.  "No!" Albus said. "No, Kiss, Azkaban, first-year Hogwarts. Our country lost, yet."  "But Lucius Malfoy," Severus said tonelessly, "certainly satisfied snapping wand."  "All right," Harry said commandingly. "As I see it, we've got two essential lines attack. Line one, find real culprit. Line two, leverage Lucius. Professor Quirrell saved Draco's life, create blood debt House Malfoy could redeem cancel Hermione's?"  Minerva blinked startlement again.  "No," Dumbledore said. The old wizard shook head. "It clever thought - no, Harry, I'm afraid not. Even unlikely event Defense Professor reveals Noble House, exception Wizengamot suspects life-debt may created deliberately, purpose. And Defense Professor hardly suspicion. Thus Lucius would argue."  Harry nodded once, face set. "So commoner blood debt Noble House, vice versa. Somehow I'm surprised. But House Potter count Noble House, I've heard. Headmaster, I know I said I - circumstances - time Draco cast torture hex me, debt enough -"  "No," old wizard said (even blurted "What?" Severus lifted eyebrow). "It would enough, debt all. You Occlumens cannot testify Veritaserum. Draco Malfoy could Obliviated memory could testify -" Albus hesitated. "Harry... whatever done Draco, must assume Lucius Malfoy soon know it."  Harry's head sank hands. "He'll give Draco Veritaserum."  "Yes," Albus said quietly.  The Boy-Who-Lived say anything, sat head hands.  The Potions Master looked genuinely shocked. "Draco really trying help Miss Granger," Severus said. "You - Potter, actually -"  "Turned him?" Harry said hands. "I three-quarters done. Taught Patronus Charm everything. I know happen now, though."  "Voldemort struck grave blow us, day," Albus said. The sound old wizard's voice like look boy head hands. "He taken two pieces, one... No. I seen earlier. He taken two Harry's pieces one move. Voldemort begun game again, myself, Harry. Voldemort knows prophecy, knows last foe shall be. He waiting face Hermione Granger Draco Malfoy Harry's side grown. He striking now."  "Maybe You-Know-Who maybe isn't," Harry said, voice sounding little unsteady. "Let's narrow hypothesis space prematurely." Harry took breath lowered hands. "The thing try nail real culprit trial - least find solid evidence someone else it."  "Mr. Potter," said Minerva, "Professor Quirrell told Aurors knew someone motive harm Mr. Malfoy. Do know talking about?"  "Yes," Harry said, hesitation. "But I think I shall conduct part investigation Defense Professor - I would Professor Quirrell room discussing investigate him."  "He suspects me?" Severus said, gave short laugh. "Why, course does."  "My plan," said Harry, "is go look trophy room supposed duel took place see I discover anything anomalous. If tell investigating Aurors let -"  "What investigating Aurors?" Severus said tonelessly.  Harry Potter took deep breath, slowly let out, spoke again. "In mystery books usually takes longer one day solve crime, twenty-four hours - no, thirty hours eighteen hundred minutes. And I think least one important place look clues - though it'll someone get Ravenclaw girls' dorm. Back Hermione fighting bullies, finding notes pillow morning, telling go -"  "Albus..." ground Minerva.  "I send them," said old wizard. His white eyebrows lifted surprise. "I knew nothing this. You think played, Harry?"  "It's possibility," Harry said. "More so, there's part puzzle know yet." Harry's voice lowered, grew intense. "Headmaster, already know I got father's invisibility cloak someone left note pillow, saying early Christmas present. I think assume that's person left notes Hermione -"  "Harry," old wizard said, hesitated momentarily. "Returning father's cloak you, seem like act villain -"  "Listen," Harry Potter said urgently. "The part know Bellatrix Black escaped Azkaban, I found another note pillow, signed 'Santa Claus', saying they'd heard shutting inside Hogwarts, giving escape route Salem Witches' Institute America. That note came deck cards, King Hearts supposedly portkey -"  "Mr. Potter!" cried Professor McGonagall, even thought spoke. "That could well kidnapping attempt! You told - "  "Yes, Professor, I sensible thing," boy said levelly. "As adapted circumstances, I sensible thing. I told Professor Quirrell. And according Professor Quirrell, portkey goes somewhere London - definitely strong enough international portkey. Now possible person sent note honest, point London way station." The boy reached robes took deck cards, along folded paper note. "I trust go guns blazing - I mean wands blazing - case sender ally mine, yours. But trap, I say spring now. And whoever is, take alive exhibit Wizengamot, I cannot overemphasize part."  Severus rose chair, eyes intent, moved toward Harry. "I'll need hair Polyjuice, Mr. Potter -"  "Let us hasty!" said Albus. "We yet examined notes sent Miss Granger; may resemblance all. Severus, would enter dorm room see find those?"  Harry Potter's eyebrows raised, even stood offer Potions Master better access mess hair. "You think two different people running around Hogwarts leaving notes beneath pillows?"  Severus gave brief sardonic laugh, hand moved forward plucked hair, soon carefully wrapped silk. "Quite possibly. If I learned anything tenure Head Slytherin, I learned ridiculous messes arise one plotter one plan. But Headmaster - I think Mr. Potter correct I follow portkey see leads."  Albus hesitated, nodded reluctantly. "I speak go, then."   Even Harry Potter left room investigations, Severus spun heel strode swiftly toward jar Floo powder, cloak rising behind speed. "I'll get raw Polyjuice, add hair, go. Headmaster, stand -"  "Albus," Minerva said, surprised steady voice was, "did leave notes Mr. Potter's pillow?"  Severus's hand halted instant casting Floo powder fire.  Dumbledore nodded her, though accompanying smile seemed bit hollow. "You know far well, dear."  "And I suppose portkey goes friendly home Mr. Potter would kept safe sound arrived pick return Hogwarts?" Her voice tight - sensible, could deny sensible, somehow seemed little cruel.  "It would depend circumstances," old wizard said quietly. "If Harry gone far - I might let make good escape, time. Better know going, ensure somewhere safe, friends -"  "And think," said Professor McGonagall, "that I thought reprimand Mr. Potter telling us important matter! Upbraid sense trust us!" Her voice risen volume. "I shall skip lecture, I suppose!"  Severus gazing Headmaster narrowed eyes. "And notes Miss Granger -"  "The Defense Professor, likely," old wizard said. "Still - guess."  "I shall go look them," Severus said. "And then, I suppose, start looking You-Know-Who." A frown crossed Potions Master's face. "A task I faintest idea start. Do know magics find soul, Headmaster?"   The Divination classroom lit dim red light hundred small fires burned hundred kinds incense, ask one word room looked like, answer would 'smoke'. (Assuming bothered look anything, nose threatening overload die.) If gaze could pierce dank mists, would see tiny, cluttered room forty stuffed armchairs, unused, crammed around small open space center room, circular trapdoor waited escape.  "The grim!" Professor Trelawney said quavering voice, peered George Weasley's teacup. "The grim! It sign death! One know, George - someone know die! And soon - yes, shall quite soon, I think - unless course later -"  It would good deal scarier, thought Fred George, said thing every single student Divination class. They hardly even thinking point; thoughts today's disaster -  The trapdoor floor flew open bang caused Professor Trelawney shriek spill George's tea robes, instant later Dumbledore whooshing floor bird fire upon shoulder.  "Fred!" old wizard said commandingly. His robes black moonless night, eyes hard like blue diamonds. "George! With me, now!"  There collective gasp time Fred George climbing ladder Headmaster, entire class already speculating role they'd played attempted murder Draco Malfoy.  The trapdoor hardly slammed shut nearby sounds muted old wizard spun held hand commanded, "Give map!"  "M-map?" said Fred George total shock. They'd never even suspected Dumbledore suspected. "Why, w-we know -"  "Hermione Granger trouble," said old wizard.  "The Map dorm," George Fred said immediately. "Just give us minutes get we'll -"  The wizard's arms swept hugging-pillows, piercing cry flash fire three third-year Gryffindor's boys' dorm.  A moments later, Fred George handing Map Headmaster, wincing slightly sacrilege giving precious piece Hogwarts security system person actually owned it, old wizard frowning apparent blankness.  "You've got say," explained, "I solemnly swear I good -"  "I decline lie," said old wizard. He held Map high bellowed, "Hear me, Hogwarts! Deligitor prodi!" An instant later Headmaster wearing Sorting Hat, looked scarily right upon head, though Dumbledore always waiting patchwork pointed hat complete existence.  (Fred George immediately memorized phrase, case would work somebody besides Headmaster, began trying think pranks would involve Sorting Hat.)  The old wizard wasted moment sweeping Sorting Hat head turning upside-down - hard tell Hat upside-down, looked bit cross treatment - plunged hand drew crystal rod. With instrument began tracing rune-like patterns Map, muttering strange incantations sounded quite like Latin echoed ears unusually creepy fashion. In midst tracing one rune looked them, fixing sharp glare. "I return later, sons Weasley. Go back class."  "Yes, Headmaster," said, hesitated. "Ah - Hermione Granger, really going bound serve Draco Malfoy forever -"  "Go," said old wizard.  They went.  When alone room, old wizard looked map, written upon fine line drawing Gryffindor dorms stood, small handwritten Albus P.W.B. Dumbledore name left therein.  The old wizard smoothed map, bent it, whispered, "Find Tom Riddle."   The interrogation room Department Magical Law Enforcement usually lit small orange light, Auror interrogating would leaning toward uncomfortable metal chair face shadow, preventing reading expression, even read yours.  As soon Mr. Quirrell entered room, small orange light dimmed begun flickering like candle blown wind. The room lit sourceless ice-colored glow illuminated Mr. Quirrell's pale skin like alabaster, except, somehow, eyes, stayed darkness.  The Auror duty outside surreptitiously tried dispel effect four times without slightest success, despite fact Mr. Quirrell politely surrendered wand upon detained interrogation, shown sign speaking incantations exerting power.  "Quirinus... Quirrell," drawled man sitting across Defense Professor waited courteously. The interrogator tawny hair swept back like lion's mane, yellowish eyes set sternly lined face man late tenth decade. The man was, moment, leafing large folder parchments taken black solid-looking briefcase limped room sat down, seeming look face man interrogating. He introduced himself.  After leafing parchments, carried silence, Auror spoke again. "Born 26th September, 1955, Quondia Quirrell, acknowledged tryst Lirinus Lumblung..." intoned Auror. "Sorted Ravenclaw... O.W.L.S. quite good... N.E.W.T.S. Charms, Transfiguration... Outstanding Muggle Studies, impressive... Ancient Runes, ah yes, Defense. An Outstanding well. Went become quite tourist, visiting sorts places. Portkey visas Transylvania, Forbidden Empire, City Endless Night... my, Texas." The man looked portfolio, eyes narrowed. "What there, Mr. Quirrell?"  "Sightseeing, mostly Muggle areas," Defense Professor said easily. "As say, I quite tourist."  The man listened frown, looked back down, again. "I also see visited Fuyuki City 1983."  The Defense Professor lifted eyebrow mild puzzlement. "What it?"  "What Fuyuki City?" The question snapped razor-sharp.  The Defense Professor frowned slightly. "Nothing account. I visited better-known sights, less-known sights, aside that, kept myself."  "Really?" Auror said softly. "I find reply rather interesting."  "How so?" said Defense Professor.  "Because visa listed Fuyuki City." The man slammed folder shut. "You're Quirinus Quirrell. Who hell you?"   The Potions Master walked quietly Ravenclaw girls' dorm, first-year dorm room, festive place bronze blue competed color stuffed animals, scarves dresses, small bits inexpensive jewelry, posters famous people. Hermione Granger's bed easy identify; one attacked book monster.  Nobody else seemed around, time day, number spells verified this.  The Potions Master searched Hermione Granger's pillow, beneath bed, began going trunk, sorting mentionable unmentionable items without change expression, finally succeeded drawing forth set papers describing places times bullies would found, papers signed elaborate 'S'.  A brief burst fire later, papers gone, Potions Master left report failure mission.   The Defense Professor sitting calmly hands still folded lap. "If consult Headmaster Dumbledore," said Defense Professor, "you find well aware matter, I agreed teach Defense class explicit condition inquiry made -"  In lightning motion, interrogator whipped wand spat "Polyfluis Reverso!" time Defense Professor sneezed, somehow caused mirror-silvered ray disrupt shower white sparks.  "Pardon me," Defense Professor said politely.  The smile Auror gave absolutely mirth it. "So where's real Quirinus Quirrell, eh? Under Imperius bottom trunk somewhere, take hair illegal Polyjuice?"  "You making highly questionable assumptions," Defense Professor said edged voice. "What makes think I steal body outright using incredibly Dark magic?"  This followed certain pause.  "I suggest," Auror said, "that take seriously, Mr. Whoever-You-Are."  "I'm sorry," said Defense Professor, leaning back chair, "but I see little reason humble particular occasion. What going do, kill me?"  "I appreciate humor," Auror said softly.  "How unfortunate you, Rufus Scrimgeour," said Defense Professor. "You deepest sympathy." He tilted head, seeming study interrogator; even within shadow ice-light, eyes glinted.   Padma stared plate.  "Hermione that!" yelled Mandy Brocklehurst, practically tears, fact tears, voice would loud enough silence Great Hall students also screaming other. "I - I bet Malfoy tried - things -"  "Our General would never that!" Kevin Entwhistle yelled even louder Mandy.  "Of course would!" shouted Anthony Goldstein. "Malfoy's son Death Eater!"  Padma stared plate.  Draco General army.  Hermione founder S.P.H.E.W.  Draco trusted second-in-command.  Hermione fellow Ravenclaw.  Both friends, maybe two best friends had.  Padma stared plate. She glad Sorting Hat offered Hufflepuff. If she'd Sorted Hufflepuff would probably much painful, trying decide divided loyalties lay...  She blinked realized vision gotten blurry again, raised trembling hand wipe eyes.  Morag MacDougal snorted loudly audible even amid pandemonium lunch, said loud voice, "I bet Granger cheated battle yesterday, I bet that's Malfoy challenged -"  "All SHUT UP!" roared Harry Potter, hit table fists hard plates rattled way along it.  At time would gotten Professors reprimanding him, time got nearby students look.  "I'd wanted eat lunch," Harry Potter said, "and get back investigating, I going talk. But silly, truth comes going regret said innocent people. Draco anything, Hermione anything, False-Memory-Charmed!" Harry Potter's voice rising last words. "How BLOODY OBVIOUS?"  "You think we'll believe that?" Kevin Entwhistle yelled right back him. "That's everyone says! 'I it, False Memory Charm!' You think we're stupid?"  And Morag nodded right along him, condescending look.  The look came Harry Potter's face made Padma flinch.  "I see," Harry Potter said, shout Padma strain hear it. "Professor Quirrell explain stupid people are, I bet time I get own. People something dumb get caught given Veritaserum. Not romantic master criminals, get caught, would learned Occlumency. Sad, pathetic, incompetent criminals get caught, confess Veritaserum, they're desperate stay Azkaban say False-Memory-Charmed. Right? So brain, sheer Pavlovian association, links idea False Memory Charms pathetic criminals unbelievable excuses. You consider specific details, brain pattern-matches hypothesis bucket things believe, done. Just like father thought magical hypotheses could never believed, he'd heard many stupid people talking magic. Believing hypothesis involves False Memory Charms low-status."  "What blithering about?" said Morag, looking nose Boy-Who-Lived.  "You think we'd believe anything say?" yelled slightly older-looking Ravenclaw witch Padma recognize. "When turned Granger Dark?"  "And I'm going complain," Harry Potter said eerily calm voice, "about wizards logic believing craziest things. Because I said Professor Quirrell once, gave look said I blinded upbringing I could think hundred ridiculous things lots Muggles believe. What human normal make unusually bad people, I'm going complain." The Boy-Who-Lived rose bench. "I'll see later."  And Harry Potter walked away them, walked away them.  "You're thinking he's right, you?" said Su Li beside her, tone made clear thought.  "I -" said Padma. Her words seemed caught throat, thoughts seemed caught head. "I - I mean - I -"   If think hard enough impossible.  (It always article faith Harry. There'd time he'd acknowledged laws physics ultimate limitations, suspected true limits all.)  If think fast enough sometimes impossible quickly...  ...sometimes.  Only sometimes.  Not always.  Not reliably.  The Boy-Who-Lived stared around trophy room, surrounded awards cups plates shields statues medals kept behind thousands, perhaps tens thousands, crystal glass displays. For many centuries Hogwarts existed, room accumulating details. A week, month, maybe even year, sufficed take 'examine' option every item room. With Professor Flitwick gone, Harry asked Professor Vector way detect damage wards around crystal cases, verify residue real duel left behind. Harry raced Hogwarts library looking spells tell difference old fingerprints new fingerprints, detect lingering exhalations room. And attempts playing detective failed.  There clues, none smart enough find.  Professor Snape said portkey led empty house London, sign anyone anything else.  Professor Snape found notes Hermione's dorm.  Headmaster Dumbledore said Voldemort's spirit probably hiding Chamber Secrets Hogwarts security system find him. Harry snuck Slytherin dungeons Cloak Invisibility spent rest afternoon looking obvious places, found anything snaky answered back spoken to. The entrance Chamber Secrets, seemed, meant found day.  Harry talked Hermione's friends would still talk him, none remembered Hermione saying anything specific she'd believed Draco plotting her.  Professor Quirrell come back Ministry dinnertime. The older students seemed think year's Defense Professor would probably end blamed incident, fired teaching Hogwarts students violent. They'd talked Defense Professor though already gone.  Harry used six hours Time-Turner, still clues, go sleep wanted functional Hermione's trial next day.  The Boy-Who-Destroyed-A-Dementor standing middle Hogwarts trophy room, wand dropped feet.  He crying.  Sometimes call brain answer.  The trial Hermione Granger started schedule next day.   Chapter 80: Taboo Tradeoffs, Pt 2, The Horns Effect  The Most Ancient Hall Wizengamot cool dark, concentric half-circles stone rising lowest center, simple wooden benches set upon elevated half-circles. There source light, chamber well-lit, without apparent cause reason; simply brute fact hall well-lit. The walls like floor stone, dark stone, elegant mysterious conjugation rock fine gaze upon, smooth texture seems flow shift beneath surface. This Most Ancient Hall, oldest place wizardry lasted modern day; every place power destroyed one war another. This Hall Wizengamot, ancient wars ended building place.  This Hall Wizengamot; older places, hidden. Legend holds walls dark stone conjured, created, willed existence Merlin, gathered powerful wizards left world awed accepting chief. And (the legend continues) Seers continued foretell enough yet done prevent end world magic, (the story goes) Merlin sacrificed life, wizardry, time, lay force Interdict Merlin. It act without cost, place like one could raised power still known wizardkind. Nor yet destroyed, walls dark stone would pass unharmed, perhaps unwarmed, heart nuclear explosion. It pity nobody knows make anymore.  In highest rising half-circles Wizengamot, topmost level dark stone, podium. At podium stands old man, care-lined face silver beard stretches waist; Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore. His right hand bears wand power, upon shoulder perches bird fire. His left hand holds short rod, thin featureless forged dark stone walls, Line Merlin Unbroken, device Chief Warlock. Karen Dutton bequeathed Line Albus Dumbledore last day life, scant hours returned half-dead defeat Grindelwald phoenix flaming brightly side. She turn received Line perfectionist Nicodemus Capernaum, wizard passing chosen successor, back back unbroken chain day Merlin laid life. That (if wondering) country magical Britain managed elect Cornelius Fudge Minister, yet end Albus Dumbledore Chief Warlock. Not law (for written law rewritten) ancient tradition, Wizengamot choose shall preside follies. Since day Merlin's sacrifice, important duty Chief Warlock exercise highest caution choice people good able discern good successors. You would expect chain light miss step, sometime centuries; would go astray least once, never return. But not. The Line Merlin continues, unbroken.  (Or say Dumbledore's faction. Lord Malfoy would tell otherwise. And Asia tell tales entirely, may make Britain's version wrong.)  Upon bottommost platform Ancient Hall high-backed chair, legged armed without cushions, dark metal rather dark stone, Merlin place there.  The Ministry building grew around place wood-paneled gold-washed, bright fire-lit, filled bustling foolishness. This place different. It stone heart magical Britain, neither gold-washed wood-paneled, neither fire-lit bright.  Filing solemnly room witches wizards plum-colored robes embroidered silver W. They carry air seriousness showing well aware terribly, terribly important. They meeting Most Ancient Hall, all. They Lords Ladies Wizengamot, consider greatest folk world's greatest magical country. Lesser folk fallen bended knee supplication; powerful, wealthy, noble; great?  Albus Dumbledore knows everyone room name. He taught many them, though learned. Some allies, opponents, rest courts within careful dance neutrality. All them, him, people.  The current Defense Professor Hogwarts, asked opinion Lords Ladies, would say many ambitious, ambition. He would observe Wizengamot exactly someone like would end - exactly sort opportunity would grasp, nothing better do. Such folk rarely interesting, often useful; pieces manipulated, points scored, true players game.  Not among rising half-circles, one side among raised arc spectators, next witch pointed hat whose face lined apprehension, sits boy dressed formal black robes owns. His eyes green ice abstraction, hardly glances Lords Ladies bustle in. To collection murmuring plum-colored robes decorate wooden benches, visual background scene Most Ancient Hall. If enemy here, something manipulated, merely "the Wizengamot". The wealthy elites magical Britain collective force, individual agency; goals alien trivial personal roles tale. As now, present time, boy neither likes dislikes plum-colored robes, brain assign enough agenthood subjects moral judgment. He PC, wallpaper.  This view change.   Harry gazed unseeing around hall Wizengamot; looked quite old historic doubt Hermione could lectured place hours end. The plum-colored robes stopped arriving, Harry's pocketwatch, advancing rate three minutes every half-hour, said trial almost due start.  Professor McGonagall sitting beside him, eyes never left twenty consecutive seconds.  Harry read Daily Prophet morning. The headline "MAD MUGGLEBORN TRIES TO END ANCIENT LINE" rest paper same. When Harry nine years old IRA blown British barracks, he'd watched TV politicians contested see could loudly outraged. And thought occurred Harry - even then, he'd known much psychology - looked like everyone competing see could angry, nobody would've allowed suggest anyone angry, even they'd proposed saturation nuclear bombing Ireland. He'd struck, even then, essential emptiness indignation politicians - though words describe it, age - sense trying score cheap points hitting safe target everyone else.  Harry always possessed sense hollowness political indignation, strange much obvious seemed, reading dozen articles Daily Prophet beating Hermione Granger.  The leading article, written name Harry recognize, called minimum age Azkaban lowered, twisted mudblood defaced honor Scotland savage, unprovoked attack upon last heir Most Ancient House within sacred refuge Hogwarts could sent Dementors punishment commensurate severity unspeakable crime. Only would enough discourage foreign, subhuman brutes similarly believed twisted insanity could evade majesty Wizengamot's inevitable merciless scourging threatened honorable nobility etcetera etcetera etcetera.  The next article said thing less eloquent words.  Earlier, Albus Dumbledore told him,  "I try keep trial." The old wizard's voice quiet unyielding. "I well foresee would go. But I would treat equal courtesy return. The politics Wizengamot delicate, know nothing. Dare folly shall Hermione Granger's cost; remember folly rest days, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres."  "I understand," Harry said. "I know. Just - planning pull rabbit hat save day last minute everything seems lost, please tell instead letting sit worry -"  "I would you," old wizard said, terrible weariness seeming suffuse turned go. "Still less Hermione. But I rabbits hat, Harry. We see Lucius Malfoy wants."  There small sharp rap, single brief sound somehow silenced entire room caused Harry's head jerk around upward. High above, Dumbledore tapped podium dark rod held left hand.  "The ninetieth session two-hundred-and-eighth Wizengamot convened request Lord Lucius Malfoy," old wizard said tonelessly.  At once, far side podium also highest circle, rose tall man mane long white spilling head shoulders plum-colored robes. "I present witness questioning Veritaserum," Lucius Malfoy said, cool tone clear throughout room, smoothly controlled slight undertone righteous fury. "Let Hermione, first Granger, brought forth."  "I ask remember first-year Hogwarts," Dumbledore said. "I brook abuse witness -"  Someone benches quite audibly said "Pfah!" spread disgusted snorts, even one two jeers.  Harry stared plum-colored robes, eyes narrowing.  And growing anger came something else, rising sense disquiet, something horribly skewed, like reality disrupted. Harry knew that, somehow, figure awry, mind thought getting worse...  "Order!" Dumbledore bellowed. He rapped stone rod twice podium, producing two small clicks overrode noise. "I order here!"  The door witness brought forth set directly beneath Harry's seat, entire group emerged fully stone hall Harry saw -  - Auror trio -  - Hermione's back Harry brought out, see face -  - followed shining silver sparrow running moonlit squirrel -  - source horrible wrongness, half-hidden beneath tattered cloak.  Harry shot feet could even think, Professor McGonagall's sudden frantic grab wrist stopped hand going wand; Transfiguration Professor whispered desperately, "Harry right there's Patronus -"  It took seconds Harry remember himself. For part understood Hermione directly exposed Dementor, argue parts something like sanity -  But animal Patronuses perfect, said another voice inside mind. Or Dumbledore see form naked man painful look upon. You felt approaching, animal Patronus no...  Slowly, Harry Potter sat back Professor McGonagall pulled grip wrist.  But he'd already declared war country magical Britain, idea people calling Dark Lord longer seemed important one way another.  Hermione's face became visible him, sat chair. She upright defiant like she'd front Snape, crying like she'd Aurors arrested her. She sat look vacant horror dark metal chains snaked chair bound arms legs.  Harry take it. Without even thinking trying flee inside himself, flee dark side, pull cold rage like shield. It took long, tried go fully dark side since Azkaban. And blood something like cold, looked again, saw Hermione chair again, discovered dark side knew nothing deal type pain, pierced coldness like knife hurt less slightest.  "Why, Harry Potter!" came high, light female voice, sickly sweet indulgent.  Slowly, Harry turned head away chair saw smiling woman wearing much makeup skin looked almost pink, sitting next man Harry recognized photographs Minister Cornelius Fudge.  "Did something say, Mr. Potter?" inquired woman, cheerfully trial.  Other people also looking now.  Harry speak, words mind would stupid speak aloud. He find anything say Neville could also said. Dumbledore warned Harry anyone else wanted Boy-Who-Lived speak, must pretend age -  "The Headmaster said I ought talk," boy said, quite able keep edge voice.  "Oh, permission talk!" woman said brightly. "I'm sure Wizengamot always happy hear Boy-Who-Lived!" Beside her, Minister Cornelius Fudge nodding.  The woman's face puffy overweight, visibly pale beneath makeup. Almost inevitably, certain word came mind, word toad. Which, said Harry's logical part, correlate morality way. Only Disney movies ugly people likely evil vice versa; movies probably scripted writers who'd never ugly. He'd give chance, everyone room deserved one chance...  "Because I got rid Dark Lord?" boy said, pointed Dementor hovering behind Hermione's chair. "There's something room that's Darker."  The woman's face narrowed, growing little stern. "I realize young boy like may scared them, Mr. Potter, Dementors quite obedient Ministry Magic. And would, course, necessary guard -"  "A twelve-year-old girl?" boy yelled. "Those Darkest creatures whole world, I could feel coming even Patronus - wrongness coming nearer - horribly evil - it'd eat everyone room, could! It let near child, ever! Not me, her, anyone! You ought vote send away!"  "We'll certainly vote -" toad-woman snapped.  "That's enough, Madam Umbridge, Mr. Potter," came Dumbledore's stern voice high above. And short pause, old wizard went on, "Although, course, boy correct every count."  Some members Wizengamot looking abashed Boy-Who-Lived's admonition, others nodding violently old wizard's words. But few. Harry could see it. They few.  The Veritaserum brought then, Hermione looked brief moment like sob, looking Harry - no, Professor McGonagall - Professor McGonagall mouthing words Harry make angle. Then Hermione swallowed three drops Veritaserum face grew slack.  "Gawain Robards," said smooth voice Lucius Malfoy. "Your probity known us. If would honors?"  One three Aurors stepped forward.  After first questions Harry looked away stared one side fingers ears, Hermione's brain played back contents False Memory Charm. He handle drug-dulled anguish Hermione's voice recounted false memories, dark side handle either, he'd already heard contents summarized.  Harry's mind flashed back another day horror, even though Harry verge writing Lord Voldemort's continued existence senility old wizard, suddenly seemed horribly uniquely plausible entity who'd Memory-Charmed Hermione mind - made use - Bellatrix Black. The two events certain signature common. To choose happen, plan happen - would take evil, would take emptiness.  Harry looked moment, then, saw plum-colored robes watching, watching.  Some time later, stars night sky gone cold dark last light Universe sputtered embers gone black, questioning Hermione ended.  "If pleases Lords," said voice Lord Malfoy, "I like testimony son Draco, witnessed two drops Veritaserum, read aloud time."  Until went battle, I plotting anything Granger. But day I really feeling insulted, I'd helped times -  The sound came Hermione's throat like she'd crushed falling stone, huge cry breathe, small sad gasp.  "Pardon me," said one witch seemed Malfoy-aligned side room. "But Lord Malfoy, would son help mudblood girl?"  "My son," Lucius Malfoy said heavy voice, "seems listening certain misguided ideas. He young - learned, now, seen country, folly brings repayment."  A steps along visitor's benches, man wearing newsman's cap badge identifying belonging Daily Prophet avidly scribbling long quill.  The people who'd nodded along Dumbledore earlier rather sick looks faces. One witch plum-colored robes quite deliberately stood seemed like Dumbledore's side room, made way toward Malfoy side.  The Auror went reading, voice monotone.  I'd tired casting locking wards, I weak I cast last one. I thought I stronger Granger I certain, I tested empirically challenging duel, that's I d-d-did also I'd I planning beat next day everyone could see. Stupid Veritaserum. But know tried kill me! And I really insulted she'd done, I really helped I planning anything then, went front everyone!"  When witness testimony done, deliberations Wizengamot began.  If could call that.  It seemed many members Wizengamot strong opinion murder bad.  The plum-colored robes Dumbledore's side room silent, supposed forces good saving political capital winnable battles. And Harry could hear, though Professor Quirrell standing next him, dry voice mind; explaining would hardly politicians' advantage speak, then.  But one wizard room whose status high enough had, seemed, transcended caution losing face; one wizard alone whose status high enough could speak word sanity escape unscathed. He alone spoke defend Hermione, man phoenix flaming bright upon shoulder.  Only Albus Dumbledore spoke.  The Chief Warlock raise possibility Hermione Granger entirely innocent. That, Headmaster explained Harry, would believed, would make worse.  But Albus Dumbledore said, one gentle reminder another, perpetrator first-year girl Hogwarts; many done foolish things youth; first-year Hogwarts simply young comprehend consequences acts. He (the Chief Warlock said quietly) attempted certain foolish things childhood, well older she.  Albus Dumbledore said Hermione Granger beloved Hogwarts faculty, helped four Hufflepuff girls Charms homework, scored one hundred three points Ravenclaw course school year.  Albus Dumbledore said nobody knew Hermione Granger would anything shocked events. That had, them, heard horror voice recounted testimony. And unusual madness temporarily possessed her, - voice rising stern command - deserved nothing except sympathy healer's attentions.  And last, Albus Dumbledore reminded Wizengamot, cries protest, charge attempted murder murder. Albus Dumbledore said, rising storm objections, lasting harm come anyone. And Albus Dumbledore begged worse anything yet done -  "Enough!" bellowed Lucius Malfoy, show hands ended deliberations. The white-maned man stood tall terrible, silver cane held high one hand like gavel fall. "For mad woman tried to son - blood debt owes trying end line Noble Most Ancient House - I say -"  "Azkaban!" roared man scarred face, seated Lord Malfoy's right hand. "Send mad mudblood Azkaban!"  "Azkaban!" cried another plum-colored robe, another, another -  A click rod Dumbledore's hand silenced room. "You order," old wizard said sternly. "And proposal barbaric, beneath dignity assembly. There things do. Lord Malfoy?"  Lucius Malfoy listened impassive face. "Well," Lord Malfoy said moments. A cold gleam lit eyes. "I planned ask it. But Wizengamot - let pay place would pay. Let Azkaban."  A great cheer rage went -  "Are lost?" cried Albus Dumbledore. "She young! Her mind would withstand it! Not three centuries thing done Britain!"  "What countries think us?" said sharp voice woman Harry recognized Neville's grandmother.  "Will guard Azkaban goes there, Lord Malfoy?" said stern old witch Harry know. "For Aurors may decline guard it, I fear, small children kept within."  "The deliberations ended," Lucius Malfoy said coldly. "But incapable finding Aurors obey vote Wizengamot, Madam Bones, may relinquish position; easily find another serve place. The Hall clear. For monstrosity crimes, girl tried adult punished accordingly; ten years Azkaban, justice attempted murder."  When old wizard spoke again, voice lower. "Is alternative this, Lucius? We may retire chambers discuss it, need be."  The tall man long white hair turned, then, regard old wizard stood podium; two stared long moment.  When Lucius Malfoy spoke voice seemed tremble ever slightly, though stern control failing. "Blood calls repayment, blood family. Not price I sell blood debt owed son. You would understand that, never love child own. Still, one debt owed House Malfoy, I think son, stood among us, would rather repaid mother's blood own. Confess crime Wizengamot, confessed me, I shall -"  "Don't even think it, Albus," said stern old witch spoken before.  The old wizard stood podium.  The old wizard stood podium, face twisting, untwisting -  "Stop it," said old witch. "You know answer must give, Albus. It change agonizing it."  The old wizard spoke.  "No," said Albus Dumbledore.  "And you, Malfoy," continued stern old witch, "I suppose really wanted whole time ruin -"  "Hardly," said Lucius Malfoy, lips twisting bitter smile. "No, I purpose son's vengeance. I wished show Wizengamot truth behind old man's pretended heroism praise girl - would hardly think sacrificing save her."  "Cruelty worthy Death Eater indeed," said Augusta Longbottom. "Not I'm implying anything, course."  "Cruelty?" said Lucius Malfoy, bitter smile still face. "I think not. I knew answer would be. I ever warned plays pretended part. If believe hesitation, fool you. Remember answer same." The man raised voice. "Let us vote, friends. I think show hands suffice it. I imagine many choose align murderers." The voice went cold, last note, promise clear.  "Look girl," said Albus Dumbledore. "See her, see horror committing! She -" The old wizard's voice broke. "She afraid -"  The Veritaserum must wearing off, Hermione Granger's face twisting beneath slackness, limbs trembling visibly beneath chains, though trying run, run chair, pressed weights larger enchanted metal links bound her. Then convulsive effort Hermione's neck moved, head twisted, enough bring eyes line -  She looked Harry Potter though speak, absolutely clear saying.  Harry  help  please -  And Most Ancient Hall Wizengamot icy voice rang out, speech color liquid nitrogen, pitched high came young throat, voice said, "Lucius Malfoy."   In ancient hallowed halls Wizengamot, people looked around took eyes long find sought. It might high pitch, might under-loud words spoken; yet even so, expected hear voice child.  It Lord Malfoy spoke return people even realized looking.  "Harry Potter," said Lucius Malfoy. He incline head.  Heads spun, eyes moved, people focused messy-haired young boy standing near weeping older witch. The boy stood merely chest-high shoes on, dressed short robes formal black. Though unless eyes keen indeed, seen, way across Hall, famous deadly scar beneath messy hair.  "This folly become you, Lucius," said boy. "Twelve-year-old girls go around committing murders. You Slytherin intelligent one. You know plot. Hermione Granger placed gameboard force, whatever hand lies behind plot. You surely intended act acting - except Draco Malfoy meant dead, meant beyond reason. But alive sane. Why cooperating intended role, plot meant take life son?"  A storm seemed raging inside Lucius, face beneath flowing white hair threatening crack open spill something unguessable. The Lord Malfoy seemed almost speak twice again, swallowing three unheard sentences lips parted true. "A plot, say?" Lord Malfoy said last. His face twitching, hardly controlled. "And whose plot would be, then?"  "If I knew," said boy, "I would said good deal earlier. But anyone ever Hermione Granger's classmate could tell unlikely murderess. She does, fact, help Hufflepuffs homework. This natural event, Lord Malfoy."  "Plot - plot -" Lucius's voice trembling. "This mudblood filth touched son I end her. You know full well, Harry Potter."  "It questionable," boy said, "to put mildly, whether Hermione Granger actually cast Blood-Cooling Charm. I know exact circumstances spells involved, simple trickery would sufficed make it. She act will, perhaps act all. Your vengeance misdirected, Lord Malfoy, deliberately so. It twelve-year-old girl deserves ire."  "And care fate?" Lucius Malfoy's voice rising. "What stake this?"  "She friend," boy said, "as Draco friend. It possible blow aimed me, House Malfoy all."  Again muscles jumped Lucius's face. "And lying - lied son!"  "Believe not," boy said quietly, "I never willed anything Draco know truth -"  "Enough!" cried Lord Malfoy. "Enough lies! Enough games! You understand - would never understand - means son! I denied vengeance! No more! Never again! For blood girl owes House Malfoy, shall go Azkaban. And I ever find another hand work - even - hand shall cut well!" Lucius Malfoy raised deadly silver cane though command, teeth clenched lips drawn back snarl, like wolf facing dragon. "And nothing better say - silent, Harry Potter!"   Harry's blood hammering even beneath ice dark side, fear Hermione, part wanted lash Lucius destroy stood insolence stupidity - Harry power, even single vote Wizengamot -  Draco said Lucius scared him, unknown reason. And Harry could see rictus Lord Malfoy's face become, drawn tight, taking courage tell Harry shut up.  So Harry said, voice cool deadly, hoping hell meant something, "You earn enmity thing, Lucius..."  Someone lower rows evidently blood-purist side Wizengamot, looking young boy rather Lord Malfoy, laughed outright incredulity. Other plum-colored robes began laugh well.  Lord Malfoy gazed hard dignity, laughter spread. "If want enmity House Malfoy, shall it, child."  "Now really," said woman much pink makeup, "I think gone quite long enough, say, Lord Malfoy? The boy miss classes."  "Indeed will," said Lucius Malfoy, raised voice again. "I call vote! By show hands, let Wizengamot acknowledge blood debt owed Noble Most Ancient House Malfoy, attempted murder last scion ending line, Hermione, first Granger!"  Hands shot one another, secretary sat bottom circle began make marks parchment tally them, obvious way majority gone.  And Harry screamed inside mind, frantic call help part would offer way out, strategy, idea. But nothing, nothing, he'd played last cards lost. And last convulsive desperation Harry plunged dark side, pushed dark side, seizing deadly clarity, offering dark side anything would solve problem him; last lethal calm came him, true ice finally answering call. Beyond panic despair mind began search every fact possession, recall everything knew Lucius Malfoy, Wizengamot, laws magical Britain; eyes looked rows chairs, every person every thing within range vision, searching opportunity could grasp -   Chapter 81: Taboo Tradeoffs, Pt 3  In rising half-circles dark stone, great sea upraised hands.  The Lords Ladies Wizengamot, plum-colored robes marked silver 'W', stared stern rebuke young girl trembling chains. If had, particular ethical system, damned themselves, clearly thought quite highly done so.  Harry's breath trembling chest. His dark side come plan - rotated back speaking icily would Hermione's advantage; fact only-half-cold Harry somehow realized...  "The vote carries, favor," intoned secretary, tallying done, upraised hands fell back down. "The Wizengamot recognizes blood debt owed Hermione Granger House Malfoy attempted murder scion ending line."  Lucius Malfoy smiling grim satisfaction. "And now," said white-maned wizard, "I say debt shall paid -"  Harry clenched fists beneath bench shouted, "By debt owed House Malfoy House Potter!"  "Silence!" snapped woman much pink makeup sitting next Minister Fudge. "You've disrupted proceedings quite enough already! Aurors, escort out!"  "Wait," said Augusta Longbottom top tier seats. "What debt this?"  Lucius's hands whitened cane. "House Malfoy owes debt you!"  It world's solid hope, based one newspaper article woman who'd False-Memory-Charmed, Rita Skeeter seemed find plausible, Mr. Weasley allegedly owed James Potter debt because...  "I'm surprised forgotten," Harry said evenly. "Surely cruel painful period life, laboring Imperius curse He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, freed efforts House Potter. By mother, Lily Potter, died it, father, James Potter, died it, me, course."  There brief silence within Most Ancient Hall.  "Why, excellent point, Mr. Potter," said old witch who'd identified Madam Bones. "I, too, quite surprised Lord Malfoy would forget significant event. It must happy day him."  "Yes," said Augusta Longbottom. "He must grateful."  Madam Bones nodded. "House Malfoy could possibly deny debt - unless, perhaps, Lord Malfoy tell us misremembered something? I take quite professional interest that. We always trying improve picture dark days."  Lucius Malfoy's hands gripped silver snake-handle cane like strike it, unleash whatever power kept -  Then Lord Malfoy seemed relax, chill smile came face. "Of course," said easily. "I confess I understood, child quite correct. But I quite think two debts cancel - House Potter trying save itself, -"  "Not so," Dumbledore said above.  "- therefore," intoned Lucius Malfoy, "I demand monetary compensation well, redemption blood debt owed son. That, too, law."  Harry felt strange inward flinch. That also newspaper article, Mr. Weasley demanded additional ten thousand Galleons -  "How much?" said Boy-Who-Lived.  Lucius still wearing cold smile. "One hundred thousand Galleons. If much vault, I suppose I must accept promissory note remainder."  A roar protest went Dumbledore's side room, even plum-colored robes middle looked shocked.  "Shall put vote Wizengamot?" said Lucius Malfoy. "I think us would like see little murderess go free. By show hands, additional compensation one hundred thousand Galleons would required cancel debt!"  The clerk began tallying, vote also clear.  Harry stood there, breathing deeply.  You'd better even think this, Harry's inner Gryffindor said threateningly.  It's major purchase, observed Ravenclaw. We ought spend lot time thinking it.  It hard. It have. Two million pounds money, money worth could buy...  It strange much psychological attachment could 'only money', painful could imagine losing bank vault full gold even imagined existed one year earlier.  Kimball Kinnison hesitate, said Gryffindor. Seriously. Like, snap decision. What sort hero you? I already hate think longer 50 milliseconds.  This real life, said Ravenclaw. Losing money lot painful real people real life heroic books.  What? demanded Gryffindor. Whose side on?  I advocating particular answer, said Ravenclaw, I saying true.  Could hundred thousand Galleons used save one life spent way? said Slytherin. We research do, battles fight, difference 40,000 Galleons rich 60,000 Galleons debt trivial -  So we'll use one ways make money fast earn back, said Hufflepuff.  It's certain work, said Slytherin, lot require starting cash -  Personally, said Gryffindor, I vote save Hermione gang kill inner Slytherin.  The clerk's voice said tally recorded vote passed...  Harry's lips opened.  "I accept offer," said Harry's lips, without hesitation, without decision made; internal debate pretense illusion, true controller voice part it.  It clear Lucius Malfoy expecting reply.  The Lord Malfoy's mask calm shattered, eyes widened, stared Harry sheer blank astonishment. His mouth opened slightly, though speaking, making peculiar noises heard roar simultaneous gasps Wizengamot -  A tap stone silenced crowd.  "No," said voice Dumbledore.  Harry's head jerked around stare ancient wizard.  Dumbledore's lined face pale, silver beard visibly trembling, looked like final throes terminal illness. "I'm - sorry, Harry - choice - I still guardian vault."  "What?" said Harry, shocked compose reply.  "I cannot let go debt Lucius Malfoy, Harry! I cannot! You know - realize -"  DIE.  Harry even know part spoken, might unanimous vote, pure rage fury pouring him. For instant thought sheer force anger might take magical wing fly strike Headmaster, send tumbling back dead podium -  But mental voice spoken, old wizard still standing there, gazing Harry, long dark wand right hand, short black rod left.  And Harry's eyes also went red-golden bird claws resting shoulder Dumbledore's black robes, silent phoenix silent. "Fawkes," Harry said, voice sounding strange ears, "can scream me?"  The fiery bird old wizard's shoulder scream. Maybe Wizengamot demanded spell silence put creature, otherwise probably would screaming whole time. But Fawkes hit master, one golden wing buffeting old wizard's head.  "I cannot, Harry!" old wizard said, agony clear voice. "I I must do!"  And Harry knew, then, looked red-golden bird, well. It obvious beginning, solution.  "Then I I must," Harry said Dumbledore, though two stood alone room. "You realize that, you?"  The old wizard shook trembling head. "You change mind older -"  "I'm talking that," Harry said, voice still strange ears. "I mean I allow Hermione Granger eaten Dementors circumstances. Period. Regardless law says, matter I to stop it. Do I still need spell out?"  A strange male voice spoke somewhere far away, "Be sure girl taken directly Azkaban, put extra guard."  Harry waited, staring old wizard, spoke again. "I go Azkaban," Harry said old wizard, though stood alone world, "before Hermione taken there, start snapping fingers. It may cost life, time gets there, Azkaban anymore."  Some members Wizengamot gasped surprise.  Then greater number started laughing.  "How would even get there, little boy?" someone said, among laughing.  "I ways going places," said boy's distant voice. Harry kept eyes Dumbledore, old wizard staring shock. Harry look directly Fawkes, give plan away; mind prepared summon phoenix transport him, prepared fill mind light fury, call fire-bird might, might upon instant Dumbledore pointed wand -  "Would truly?" old wizard said Harry, also two stood alone room.  The room went silent everyone stared shock Chief Warlock Wizengamot, seemed taking mad threat completely seriously.  The old wizard's eyes locked Harry. "Would risk everything - everything - her?"  "Yes," Harry said back reply.  That's wrong answer, know, said Slytherin. Seriously.  But true answer.  "You see reason?" said old wizard.  "Apparently not," Harry said back.  The gazes stayed locked.  "This terrible folly," said old wizard.  "I aware this," answered hero. "Now get way."  Strange light glinted ancient blue eyes. "As will, Harry Potter, know over."  The rest world faded back existence.  "I withdraw objection," said old wizard, "Harry Potter may wishes," Wizengamot exploded roar shock, silenced final tap stone rod.  Harry turned head back look Lord Malfoy, looked like he'd seen cat turn person start eating cats. To call look confused begin describe it.  "You would truly..." Lucius Malfoy said slowly. "You would truly pay hundred thousand Galleons, save one mudblood girl."  "I think there's forty thousand Gringotts vault," Harry said. It strange still causing internal pain thought taking over-fifty-percent risk life destroy Azkaban. "As sixty thousand - rules, exactly?"  "It comes due graduate Hogwarts," old wizard said high above. "But Lord Malfoy certain rights then, I fear."  Lucius Malfoy stood motionless, frowning Harry. "Who you, then? What you, would pay much keep harm?"  "My friend," boy said quietly.  Lucius Malfoy's eyes narrowed. "By report I received, cannot cast Patronus Charm, Dumbledore knows this. The power single Dementor nearly killed you. You would dare venture near Azkaban person -"  "That January," said Harry. "This April."  Lucius Malfoy's eyes remained cool calculating. "You pretend destroy Azkaban, Dumbledore pretends believe it."  Harry reply.  The white-haired man turned slightly, toward center half-circle, though address greater Wizengamot. "I withdraw offer!" shouted Lord Malfoy. "I accept debt House Potter payment, even hundred thousand Galleons! The girl's blood debt House Malfoy stands!"  Again roar many voices. "Dishonorable!" someone cried. "You acknowledge debt House Potter, yet would -" voice cut off.  "I acknowledge debt, law strictly oblige accept cancellation," said Lord Malfoy grim smile. "The girl part House Potter; debt I owe House Potter debt her. As dishonor -" Lucius Malfoy paused. "As grave shame I feel ingratitude toward Potters, done much -" Lucius Malfoy bowed head. "May ancestors forgive me."  "Well, boy?" called scarred man sitting Lord Malfoy's right hand. "Go destroy Azkaban, then!"  "I'd like see that," said another voice. "Will selling tickets?"  It went without saying Harry pick particular moment give up.  The girl part House Potter -  He had, fact, seen obvious way dilemma almost instantly.  It might taken longer recently overheard number conversations older Ravenclaw girls, read certain number Quibbler stories.  He was, nonetheless, trouble accepting it.  This ridiculous, said part Harry dubbed Internal Consistency Checker. Our actions completely incoherent. First feel less emotional reluctance risk bloody LIFE probably DIE Hermione, part stupid heap gold. And balking getting married?  SYSTEM ERROR.  You know what? said Internal Consistency Checker. You're stupid.  I say no, thought Harry. I saying SYSTEM ERROR.  I vote destroying Azkaban, said Gryffindor. It needs done anyway.  Really, really stupid, said Internal Consistency Checker. Oh, screw this, I'm assuming control body.  The boy took deep breath, opened mouth -  By point Harry Potter entirely forgotten existence Professor McGonagall, sitting whole time undergoing number interesting changes facial expression Harry looking distracted. It would overly harsh say Harry forgotten consider PC. It could kindly said Professor McGonagall visibly solution current problems, therefore part universe.  So Harry, point fair amount adrenaline bloodstream, startled jumped quite visibly Professor McGonagall, eyes blazing impossible hope tears cheek half-dried, leapt feet cried, "With me, Mr. Potter!" and, without waiting reply, tore stairs led bottom platform waited chair dark metal.  It took moment, Harry ran after; though took longer reach bottom, Professor McGonagall vaulted half stairs strange catlike motion landed astonished-looking Auror trio already pointing wands her.  "Miss Granger!" cried Professor McGonagall. "Can speak yet?"  Much Professor McGonagall, certain sense could said Harry forgotten existence Hermione Granger, Harry tilting neck back look upward rather downward, considered solution current problems. Though hardly certain, fact probable, Harry remembering look Hermione think must feeling, would helped anything slightest.  Harry reached bottom stairs saw Hermione Granger full -  Without thinking, without able help himself, Harry shut eyes, he'd seen.  Her school robes around neck, soaked way tears.  The way she'd looking away him.  And eye memory sympathy, could shut, could look away, knew Hermione recounted worst shame life front nobility magical Britain Professor McGonagall Dumbledore Harry; sentenced Azkaban would exposed darkness cold worst memories went mad died; she'd heard Harry going give away money go debt save her, maybe even sacrifice life  Dementor standing paces behind  said anything...  "Y-yes," whispered voice Hermione Granger. "I c-can talk."  Harry opened eyes saw face, looking him. It say anything like thought Hermione feeling, faces say anything complicated, facial muscles could contort knots.  "H-H-Harry, I-I'm so, I'm -"  "Shut up," Harry suggested.  "s-s-sorry -"  "If never met train trouble right now. So shut up," said Harry Potter.  "Both stop silly," Professor McGonagall said firm Scottish accent (it strange much helped). "Mr. Potter, hold wand Miss Granger's fingers touch it. Miss Granger, repeat me. Upon life magic -"  Harry bid, thrusting wand forward touch Hermione's fingers; Hermione's faltering voice said, "Upon life magic -"  "I swear service House Potter -" said Professor McGonagall.  And Hermione, without waiting instructions, said, words spilling rush, "I swear service House Potter, obey Master Mistress, stand right hand, fight command, follow go, day I die."  All words blurted desperate gasp Harry could thought said anything, he'd mad enough interrupt.  "Mr. Potter, repeat words," said Professor McGonagall. "I, Harry, heir last scion Potters, accept service, end world magic."  Harry took breath said, "I, Harry, heir last scion Potters, accept service, end world magic."  "That's it," said Professor McGonagall. "Well done."  Harry looked up, saw entire Wizengamot, whose existence he'd forgotten, staring them.  And Minerva McGonagall, Head House Gryffindor even always act like it, looked high Lucius Malfoy stood; said entire Wizengamot, "I regret every point I ever gave Transfiguration, vile little worm."  Whatever Lucius say reply silenced tap short rod Dumbledore's hand. "Ahem!" said old wizard podium dark stone. "This session carried quite considerably, dismissed soon, us may miss entire luncheon. The law matter clear. You already voted terms bargain, Lord Malfoy cannot legally decline it. As far exceeded allotted time, I now, accordance last decision survivors eighty-eighth Wizengamot, adjourn session."  The old wizard tapped rod dark stone three times.  "You fools!" shouted Lucius Malfoy. The white hair shaking though wind, face beneath pale fury. "Do think get away done today? Do think girl try murder son escape unscathed?"  The toad-like pink-makeup woman, whose name Harry could longer remember, standing seat. "Why, course not," said sickening smile. "After all, girl still murderess, I think Ministry shall watching affairs quite closely - hardly seems wise allowed wander streets, -"  Harry fed point.  Without waiting listen, Harry turned heel strode forward long steps toward -  The horror could truly see, absence color space, wound world, floated tattered cloak; imperfectly guarded running moonlit squirrel fluttering silver sparrow.  His dark side also noticed, looking entire room anything could possibly used weapon, enemy foolish enough bring Dementor Harry's presence. That powerful weapon indeed, one Harry might wield better supposed masters. There time Azkaban Harry told twelve Dementors turn go, gone.  The Dementors Death, Patronus Charm works thinking happy thoughts instead Death.  If Harry's theory correct, one sentence would took pop Aurors' Patronus Charms like soap bubble, ensure nobody within reach voice could cast another one.  I going cancel Patronus Charms prevent Patronuses cast. And Dementor, flying faster broomstick, going Kiss everyone voted send twelve-year-old girl Azkaban.  Say that, set if-then expectation, wait people understand laugh. Then speak fatal truth; Aurors' Patronuses winked prove point, either people's anticipations mindless void, Harry's threat destruction, would make Dementor obey. Those sought compromise darkness would consumed it.  It solution dark side devised.  Ignoring gasps rising behind him, Harry crossed radius Patronuses, strode single pace Death. Its unhindered fear burst around like whirlpool, like stepping next sucking drain huge bathtub emptying water; false Patronuses longer obscuring level interacted, Harry could reach Dementor even could reach him. Harry looked straight pulling vacuum -  Earth among stars  triumph saving Hermione  someday reality shadow cease exist  Harry took silver emotion fueled Patronus Charm shoved Dementor; expected Death's shadow flee -  - Harry that, flung hands shouted "BOO!"  The void retreated sharply away Harry came dark stone behind.  In hall deathly silence.  Harry turned back empty void, looked toad-woman stood. She pale beneath pink makeup, mouth opening closing like fish.  "I make one offer," said Boy-Who-Lived. "I never learn interfering mine. And never find unkillable soul-eating monster scared me. Now sit shut up."  The toad-woman fell back bench without word.  Harry looked up.  "A riddle, Lord Malfoy!" Boy-Who-Lived shouted across Most Ancient Hall. "I know Ravenclaw, try answer one anyway! What destroys Dark Lords, frightens Dementors, owes sixty thousand Galleons?"  For instant Lord Malfoy stood eyes slightly widened; face fell back calm scorn, voice spoke coolly reply. "Are openly threatening me, Mr. Potter?"  "I'm threatening you," said Boy-Who-Lived. "I'm scaring you. There's difference."  "Enough, Mr. Potter," said Professor McGonagall. "We shall late afternoon Transfiguration is. And come back here, still terrifying poor Dementor." She turned Aurors. "Mr. Kleiner, would!"  Harry strode back them, Auror addressed moved forward pressed short rod dark metal dark metal chair, muttering inaudible word dismissal.  The chains slithered back smoothly come forth; Hermione pushed chair fast could, half-ran half-staggered forward steps.  Harry held arms -  - Hermione half-jumped half-fell Professor McGonagall's arms, beginning sob hysterically.  Hmpfh, said voice inside Harry. I kind thought we'd earned one ourselves.  Oh, shut up.  Professor McGonagall holding Hermione firmly might thought mother holding daughter, maybe granddaughter. After moments Hermione's sobs slowed, stopped. Professor McGonagall suddenly shifted stance grabbed onto tightly; girl's hands dangling limply, now, eyes closed -  "She'll fine, Mr. Potter," Professor McGonagall said softly Harry's direction, without looking him. "She needs hours one Madam Pomfrey's beds."  "All right, then," Harry said. "Let's get Madam Pomfrey's."  "Yes," said Dumbledore, descended bottom dark stone stairs. "Let us go home, indeed." His blue eyes locked Harry, hard sapphires.   The Lords Ladies Wizengamot departing wooden benches, leaving came, looking rather nervous.  The vast majority thinking 'The Dementor frightened Boy-Who-Lived!'  Some shrewder ones already wondering affect delicate power balance Wizengamot - new piece appeared upon gameboard.  Almost none thinking anything along lines 'I wonder that.'  This truth Wizengamot: Many nobles, many wealthy magnates business, came status ways. Some stupid. Most shrewd realms business politics, shrewdness circumscribed. Almost none walked path powerful wizard. They read ancient books, scrutinized old scrolls, searching truths powerful walk openly disguised conundrums, hunting true magic among hundred fantastic fairy tales. When looking contract debt, abandon shrewdness possess relax comfortable nonsense. They believe Deathly Hallows, also believe Merlin fought dread Totoro imprisoned Ree. They know (because part standard legend) powerful wizard must learn distinguish truth among hundred plausible lies. But occurred might same.  (Why not? Why, indeed, would wizards enough status wealth turn hands almost endeavor, choose spend lives fighting lucrative monopolies ink importation? The Headmaster Hogwarts would hardly see question; course people powerful wizards, people heroes. The Defense Professor could explain great cynical length ambitions trivial; him, too, puzzle. Only Harry Potter, books read, unable understand; Boy-Who-Lived life choices Lords Ladies seem incomprehensible - good person would do, yet evil person either. Now three wise?)  For whatever reason, then, Wizengamot never walked path leads powerful wizardry; seek hidden. For them, why. There explanation. There causality. The Boy-Who-Lived, already halfway magisterium legend, promoted way there; brute fact, simple unexplained, Boy-Who-Lived frightens Dementors. Ten years earlier told one-year-old boy defeated terrible Dark Lord generation, perhaps evil Dark Lord ever live; accepted too.  You meant question sort thing (they know unspoken way). If terrible Dark Lord history, confronts innocent baby - why, could vanquished? The rhythm play demands it. You supposed applaud, stand seat audience say 'Why?' It story's conceit, end Dark Lord brought little child; going question that, might well attend play first place.  It occur to second-guess application reasoning events seen eyes Most Ancient Hall. Indeed, consciously aware using story-reasoning real life. As scrutinizing Boy-Who-Lived careful logic would use political alliance business arrangement - brain would associate that, part legendary magisterium hand?  But few, seated wooden benches, think like this.  There certain Wizengamot read half-disintegrated scrolls listened tales things happened someone's brother's cousin, entertainment, part quest power truth. They already marked Night Godric's Hollow, reported Albus Dumbledore, anomalous potentially important event. They wondered happened, happen; not, Dumbledore lying.  And eleven-year-old boy rises says "Lucius Malfoy" cold adult voice, goes speak words one simply would expect hear first-year Hogwarts, allow fact slip lawless blurs legends premises plays.  They mark clue.  They add list.  This list beginning look somewhat alarming.  It particularly help boy yells "BOO!" Dementor decaying corpse presses flat opposite wall horrible ear-hurting voice rasps, "Make go away."   Chapter 82: Taboo Tradeoffs, Final  Phoenix travel sensation entirely unlike Apparition portkeys. You caught fire - definitely felt catching fire, even though pain - instead burning ashes, fire burned way became fire, went one place blazed another. It sicken stomach like portkeys Apparition, rather unnerving experience nonetheless. If underlying truth phoenix travel really becoming specific instantiation general Fire, seemed hint could potentially burn anywhere - even distant past, another universe, two places once. You might go one place blaze hundred others, arrived Hogwarts would never know difference. Though Harry read could phoenixes, trying figure get one own, there'd hint anything remotely like capability.  Harry caught fire went blazed somewhere else; like he, Headmaster, unconscious form Hermione Granger held Headmaster's arms, occupying another place; Fawkes all. A calm, warm room bright stone columns, skylit four sides, populated white beds long rows, four silencing veils drawn around them, rest empty.  In one corner Harry's vision, surprised-looking Madam Pomfrey turning toward them. Dumbledore seemed pay senior healer heed, carefully laid Hermione unoccupied white bed.  From distant corner flash green, fireplace strode Professor McGonagall, brushing slightly Floo ashes.  The old wizard turned bed reached one arms around Harry again; Boy-Who-Lived wizard vanished another burst fire.   When Harry fully lit standing Headmaster's office, amid noises dozen dozen inexplicable gidgets.  The young boy took step away old wizard turned him, emerald sapphire eyes meeting.  The two speak time, looking other; though speak could said stares, said way.  In time boy enunciated words slowly precisely.  "I cannot believe phoenix still upon shoulder."  "The phoenix chooses once," said old wizard. "They might perhaps leave master chooses evil good; leave master forced choose one good another. Phoenixes arrogant. They know limits wisdom." Stern indeed, ancient gaze. "Unlike you, Harry."  "Choose one good another," Harry echoed flatly. "Like Hermione Granger's life, versus hundred thousand Galleons." The rage indignation Harry wanted put voice quite there, reason, maybe -  "You hardly position speak that, Harry Potter." The Headmaster's voice deceptively soft. "Or look reluctance I saw upon face, Most Ancient Hall?"  The sense inward hollowness grew worse. "I looking alternatives," Harry bit out. "Some way save lose money."  Wow, said Ravenclaw. You told outright lie. Not that, I think actually believed seconds took say it. That's kinda scary.  "Is thinking, Harry?" The blue eyes keen, terrifying moment Harry wondered world's powerful wizard could see right past Occlumency barriers.  "Yes," Harry said, "I flinched away pain losing money vault. But I it! That's counts! And -" The indignation faltered Harry's voice returned. "You actually put price Hermione Granger's life, put hundred thousand Galleons!"  "Oh?" old wizard said softly. "And price put life, then? A million Galleons?"  "Are familiar economic concept 'replacement value'?" The words spilling Harry's lips almost faster could consider them. "Hermione's replacement value infinite! There's nowhere I go buy another one!"  Now talking mathematical nonsense, said Slytherin. Ravenclaw, back here?  "Is Minerva's life also infinite worth?" old wizard said harshly. "Would sacrifice Minerva save Hermione?"  "Yes yes," Harry snapped. "That's part Professor McGonagall's job knows it."  "Then Minerva's value infinite," said old wizard, "for loved. There one king upon chessboard, Harry Potter, one piece sacrifice piece save. And Hermione Granger piece. Make mistake, Harry Potter, day may well lost war."  And old wizard's words hit quite hard, quite close home, Harry might said said then.  "Lucius right," Harry ground out. "You never wife, never daughter, never anything war -"  The old wizard's left hand closed hard upon Harry's wrist, bony fingers digging still-developing muscle Harry's arm, moment Harry paralyzed shock it, forgotten meant adults stronger.  Albus Dumbledore seem notice. He turned, dragging Harry him, moved forward hard steps toward wall room.  "Phoenix's price."  Harry pulled along black stairs.  "Phoenix's fate."  The room black pedestals, silver light falling shattered wands.  "You think," yelled Harry, lips unlocked, "that win argument, standing here?"  The old wizard ignored him, dragging Harry across room. His right hand, longer holding wand, grabbed vial silver fluid -  Harry blinked shock; vial silver fluid standing next picture Dumbledore, appeared Harry brief moment dragged past.  Past end pedestals, farthest part room, rose great stone basin runes carved Harry recognize. The center shallow depression filled transparent liquid, old wizard dumped canister silver fluid, began spread out, swirl, set entire basin glowing eerie white.  The old wizard's hand let go Harry's arm gestured glowing basin, commanding harshly, "Look!"  As requested, Harry stared glowing water.  "Put head Pensieve, Harry Potter." The old wizard's voice stern.  Harry heard word before, remember . "What - -"  "Memories," old wizard said. "You see memory. My oath safe. Now look Pensieve, Ravenclaw, still care anything precious truth!"  That request Harry could deny, stepped forward thrust head glowing water.   Harry sitting behind desk Headmaster's office Hogwarts, wrinkled hands clutched head spotted age white hairs.  "He I have!" wept voice, strange Dumbledore's voice Dumbledore remembered it, inside seemed far less stern wise. "The last family! All I left!"  No emotion allowed pass Pensieve, physical sensation seeming speak words. Harry heard utter desolation Dumbledore's words, sounds seemed come Harry's throat, Harry feel beyond hearing.  "You've got choice," said harsh voice.  The eyes moved, field vision jumped man Harry recognize, clothing tinged Auror crimson made solid leather many pockets.  His right eye overlarge, electric-blue pupil constantly darted moved.  "You cannot ask me, Alastor!" Dumbledore's voice wild. "Not this! Anything this!"  "I'm asking," growled man. "Voldie's one who's asking, going tell no."  "For money, Alastor?" Dumbledore's voice begging. "Only money?"  "You ransom Aberforth, lose war," man said sharply. "That simple. One hundred thousand Galleons nearly we've got war-chest, use like this, refilled. What'll do, try convince Potters empty vault like Longbottoms already did? Voldie's going kidnap someone else make another demand. Alice, Minerva, anyone care about, they'll targets pay Death Eaters. That's lesson trying teach them."  "If I I one. No one." Dumbledore's voice broke, world tilted outlooking head fell ancient hands, awful sounds came not-Harry's throat began sob like child.  "Shall I tell Voldie's messenger no?" said Alastor's voice, strangely gentle. "You yourself, old friend."  "No - I say - I must -"   The memory ended shock Harry ripped head glowing water, gasping though he'd deprived air.  The transition scenes, decade-old reality present moment, another jolt Harry's mind; fashion immersion past unanchored him. The broken old man sobbing office another person another era, Harry understood much; someone softer -  Before vanished like dissipating smoke, returning now, present day.  Terrible stern stood ancient wizard, like carven stone; beard woven thread like iron, half-moon glasses like mirrors, pupils behind sharp unyielding black diamond.  "Do also wish see brother died Cruciatus?" said Albus Dumbledore. "Voldemort sent memory well!"  "And - " Harry trouble producing voice, growing sickness chest. "That -" The words seemed burn throat, awful knowledge dawned him, horrible understanding. "That burned Narcissa Malfoy alive bedroom."  Albus Dumbledore's gaze cold answered. "To question fool would say yea nay. What matters Death Eaters believe I killed her, belief kept safe families served Order Phoenix - day. Now understand done? What done friends, Harry Potter, stand you?" The old wizard seemed grow still taller terrible, voice rose louder. "You made targets, targets remain! Until prove, way proven, longer willing pay prices!"  "And true?" Harry said. There buzzing sensation filling him, body growing distant. "What Draco said, Narcissa Malfoy never got hands dirty, Lucius's wife? She enabler, I get that, I can't back deserving burned alive."  "Nothing less would convinced I done hesitation." The old wizard's voice brooked question refusal. "Always I reluctant I must, always others paid cost mercy. So Alastor told beginning, I listen him. You, I expect, shall prove better decisions I."  "I'm surprised," Harry said, amazed voice almost steady. "I would expected Death Eaters go another Light family start cycle escalating retaliation, get first strike."  "If opponent Lucius, perhaps." Dumbledore's eyes like stones. "I told Voldemort laughed news, proclaimed Death Eaters I finally grown, last worthy opponent. Perhaps right. After day I condemned brother death, I began weigh followed me, balancing one another, asking I would risk, I would sacrifice, end. It strange many fewer pieces I lost, I knew worth."  Harry's jaw seemed locked, like took massive effort make lips move. "But like Lucius deliberately taking Hermione ransom," Harry's voice said thinly. "From Lucius's perspective, someone else broke truce first. So mind, many Galleons Hermione worth, exactly? Leaving aside Danegeld thing, ordinary threat life, much I paid save her? Ten thousand Galleons? Five thousand?"  The old wizard answer.  "It's funny thing," Harry said, voice wavering like something seen water. "Do know, day I went front Dementor, worst memory was? It parents dying. I heard voices everything."  The old wizard's eyes widened behind half-moon glasses.  "And here's thing," Harry said, "here's thing I've thinking over. The Dark Lord gave Lily Potter chance walk away. He said could flee. He told dying front crib save baby. 'Step aside, foolish woman, sense -'" An awful chill came Harry spoke words lips, shook continued. "And afterward I kept thinking, I seem stop thinking, Dark Lord right? If Mother stepped away. She tried curse Dark Lord suicide, known suicide. Her choice life mine, choice live us die! If she'd done logical thing walked away, I mean, I love Mum too, Lily Potter would alive right would mother!" Tears blurring Harry's eyes. "Only I understand, I know Mother must felt. She step aside crib. She couldn't! Love walk away!"  It like old wizard struck, struck chisel shattered straight middle.  "What I said?" old wizard whispered. "What I said you?"  "I know!" shouted Harry. "I listening either!"  "I - I'm sorry, Harry - I -" The old wizard pressed hands face, Harry saw Albus Dumbledore weeping. "I said, things - I not, resented, innocence -"  Harry stared wizard another second, Harry turned marched black room, stairs, office -  "I really know still shoulder," Harry said Fawkes.  - oaken door endlessly turning spiral.   Harry arrived Transfiguration classroom anyone else, even Professor McGonagall. There Charms class earlier, year, even bothered trying attend. Whether Professor McGonagall would make today's class know. There something ominous empty desks beside him, absence board. As stood alone Hogwarts, friends departed.  According class schedule, today's lesson sustained Transfigurations, rules Harry learned heart back Transfiguring huge rock small diamond shone pinky finger. It would theoretical subject, rather practical, rest class; pity, could used dose Transfiguration's trance.  Harry noted distantly hand trembling, point trouble undoing pouch's drawstring drew forth Transfiguration textbook.  You monstrously unfair Dumbledore, said voice Harry calling Slytherin, also seemed Voice Economic Sensibility maybe also Conscience.  Harry's eyes dropped textbook, section familiar might well blank parchment.  Dumbledore fought war Dark Lord deliberately set break cruelest possible way. He choose losing war brother. Albus Dumbledore knows, learned worst possible way, limits value one life; almost broke sanity admit it. But you, Harry Potter - already knew better.  "Shut up," boy whispered empty Transfiguration classroom, though nobody hear it.  You'd already read Philip Tetlock's experiments people asked trade sacred value secular one, like hospital administrator choose spending million dollars liver save five-year-old, spending million dollars buy hospital equipment pay physician salaries. And subjects experiment became indignant wanted punish hospital administrator even thinking choice. Do remember reading that, Harry Potter? Do remember thinking stupid was, since hospital equipment doctor salaries also save lives, would point hospitals doctors? Should hospital administrator paid billion pounds liver, even meant hospital going bankrupt next day?  "Shut up!" boy whispered.  Every time spend money order save life probability, establish lower bound monetary value life. Every time refuse spend money save life probability, establish upper bound monetary value life. If upper bounds lower bounds inconsistent, means could move money one place another, save lives cost. So want use bounded amount money save many lives possible, choices must consistent monetary value assigned human life; could reshuffle money better. How sad, hollow indignation, refuse say money life ever compared, they're forbidding strategy saves people, sake pretentious moral grandstanding...  You knew that, still said Dumbledore.  You deliberately tried hurt Dumbledore's feelings.  He's never tried hurt you, Harry Potter, once.   Harry's head dropped hands.  Why Harry said he'd said, sad old ancient wizard who'd fought hard endured anyone ever endure? Even old wizard wrong, deserve hurt it, happened him? Why part seemed get angry old wizard beyond reason, lashing harder Harry ever hit anyone, without thought moderation rage raised, quiet soon Harry left presence?  Is know Dumbledore fight back? That matter say him, however unfair, he'll never use power you, he'll never treat way treat him? Is way treat people know hit back? James Potter's bullying genes, manifesting last?  Harry closed eyes.  Like Sorting Hat speaking inside head -  What real reason anger?  What fear?  A whirlwind images seemed flash Harry's mind, then, past Dumbledore weeping hands; present form old wizard, standing tall terrible; vision Hermione screaming chains, metal chair, Harry abandoned Dementors; imagination woman long white hair (had looked like husband?) falling amid flames bedroom, wand held upon orange light reflected half-moon glasses.  Albus Dumbledore seemed think Harry would better sort thing him.  And Harry knew probably would be. He knew math, all.  But understood, somehow understood, utilitarian ethicists actually rob banks could give money poor. The end result throwing away ethical constraint actually sunshine roses happiness all. The prescription consequentialism take action led best net consequences, actions one positive consequence wrecked everything else along way. Expected utility maximizers allowed take common sense account, calculating expectations.  Somehow Harry understood that, even anyone else warned he'd understood. Before he'd read Vladimir Lenin history French Revolution, he'd known. It might earliest science fiction books warning people good intentions, maybe Harry seen logic himself. Somehow he'd known beginning, stepped outside ethics whenever reason, end result good.  A final image came him, then: Lily Potter standing front baby's crib measuring intervals outcomes: final outcome stayed tried curse enemy (dead Lily, dead Harry), final outcome walked away (live Lily, dead Harry), weighing expected utilities, making sensible choice.  She would've Harry's mother had.  "But human beings can't live like that," boy's lips whispered empty classroom. "Human beings can't live like that."   Chapter 83: Taboo Tradeoffs, Aftermath 1  When Padma entered Transfiguration classroom, saw half class beaten there, strange, deathly silence pervading room. Harry Potter sat alone one corner, staring unknown distance, eyes half-lidded, nearly closed.  Rumor said Aurors discovered Defense Professor Polyjuiced Granger fool Malfoy.  Rumor said Hermione bound Unbreakable Vow Draco Malfoy's slave.  Rumor said Hermione gotten Dementor's Kiss.  But true, Harry Potter sitting there, would -  Padma know General Potter would do. Her mind went blank, trying think it.  Even Professor McGonagall got there, silence broken. The Transfiguration Professor walked board without pause, erased sweep hand, began write.  "Today, children," began calm professional voice Transfiguration Professor, though nothing ordinary happened week, "we shall learn much effort takes sustain Transfiguration, why, age, even try. The original Form gone, suppressed; maintain suppression -"  "Excuse me," said Padma Patil. She knew voice shaking, knew trembling visibly, ask. "Excuse me, Professor, happened Miss Granger?"  The Transfiguration Professor paused board, turned look Padma. The Professor looked stern, interrupted without hand raised, instead face kindly. "You already know, Miss Patil? I expected rumor would spread."  "There's many rumors," said Padma. "I know what's true."  Morag MacDougal raised hand, said without waiting called, "I told you, Padma, what's true Wizengamot found Granger guilty ordered get Dementor's Kiss brought Dementor Harry Potter glued ceiling let -"  "Oh, dear Merlin," said Professor McGonagall, expression growing sharp, visibly calmed herself. "The affair utterly ridiculous I go detail. Let stand Miss Granger resting Madam Pomfrey now, coming back classes tomorrow. And I catch anyone bothering her, I shall turn glass vases drop them."  The entire class gasped this; much threat fatal, broke safety rules Transfiguration.  Professor McGonagall turned back board -  From corner classroom, another voice rose up. "What Professor Quirrell?" said Terry Boot. "Has arrested?"  "The Aurors detaining him," said Transfiguration Professor without turning around. "If given back Defense Professor tomorrow, I shall ask Headmaster go fetch him. Though I may well tell Board Governors scheduled vote whether Professor Quirrell's battles shall allowed continue."  Kevin Entwhistle spoke. "And General Malfoy? When's getting back St. Mungo's?"  The Transfiguration Professor paused drawing.  She turned around again, slowly, time.  "I sorry, Mr. Entwhistle," said Professor McGonagall. Her face looked little lined entered room. "Mr. Malfoy's health danger, I given understand. Unfortunately, I received owl Mr. Malfoy's father withdrawing Hogwarts. I afraid coming back."   Chapter 84: Taboo Tradeoffs, Aftermath 2  When Hermione Granger woke, found lying soft, comfortable bed Hogwarts infirmary, square setting sunlight falling midriff, warm thin blanket. Memory said would screen-sheet her, either drawn around bed open, rest Madam Pomfrey's domain would lie beyond: beds, occupied unoccupied, bright windows set curvily-carven stone Hogwarts.  When Hermione opened eyes, first thing saw face Professor McGonagall, sitting left side bed. Professor Flitwick there, understandable, he'd stayed side morning detention cell, silver raven standing extra guard Dementor stern little face always turned outward toward Aurors. The Head Ravenclaw surely spent way much time her, probably get back teaching classes, instead keeping watch convicted attempted-murderess.  She felt horribly, horribly sick think potions. Hermione would've started crying again, throat hurt, eyes still burned, mind felt tired. She borne weep again, find strength tears.  "Where parents?" Hermione whispered Head House Gryffindor. Somehow seemed like worst thing world face them, even worse everything else; yet still wanted see them.  The gentle look Professor McGonagall's face Transfigured something sadder. "I'm sorry, Miss Granger. Though always so, found recent years wiser tell parents Muggleborns danger child faced. I advise also remain silent, wish stay Hogwarts without trouble them."  "I'm expelled?" girl whispered. "For I did?"  "No," said Professor McGonagall. "Miss Granger... surely heard... I hope heard Mr. Potter, said innocent?"  "He saying that," said dully. "To get free, I mean."  The older witch shook head firmly. "No, Miss Granger. Mr. Potter believes Memory-Charmed, whole duel never happened. The Headmaster suspects even Darker magics may involved - hand might cast spell, will. Even Professor Snape finds affair completely unbelievable, though may able say publicly. He wondering Muggle drugs might used you."  Hermione's eyes went staring distantly Transfiguration Professor; knew she'd told something significant, find energy propagate changes mind.  "Surely believe it?" said Professor McGonagall. "Miss Granger, cannot believe would turn murder!"  "But I -" Her excellent memory helpfully replayed thousandth time, Draco Malfoy telling sneer she'd never beat tired, proceeding prove that, dancing like duelist warded trophies frantically scrambled, dealing ending blow hex sent crashing wall drew blood cheek - - she'd -  "But remember it," said older witch, watching kindly understanding. "Miss Granger, need twelve-year-old girl bear dreadful memories. Say word I shall happy lock away you."  It like glass warm water thrown face. "What?"  Professor McGonagall took wand, gesture practiced quick seemed like pointing finger. "I can't offer rid memories entirely, Miss Granger," Transfiguration Professor said customary precision. "There may important facts buried there. But form Memory Charm reversible, I shall happy cast you."  Hermione stared wand, feeling stirrings hope first time almost two days.  Make happen... she'd wished over again, hands time turn back erase horrible choice could never, ever undone. And erasing memory that, still kind release...  She looked back Professor McGonagall's kindly face.  "You really think I it?" Hermione said, voice trembling.  "I quite certain would never thing will."  Beneath blankets, Hermione's hands clutched sheets. "Harry think I it?"  "Mr. Potter opinion memories entire fabrications. I rather see point."  Then Hermione's clutching fingers let go sheet, slumped back bed, she'd partially risen.  No.  She said anything.  She'd woken remembered happened last night, like - like - find words even thoughts like. But she'd known Draco Malfoy already dead, said anything, gone Professor Flitwick confessed. She'd dressed gone breakfast tried act normal nobody would ever know, she'd known wrong Wrong horribly horribly WRONG she'd so, scared -  Even Harry Potter right, even duel Draco Malfoy lie, she'd made choice herself. She deserve forget that, forgiven it.  And done right thing, gone straight Professor Flitwick, maybe would've - helped, somehow, maybe everyone would've seen regretted it, Harry give away money save -  Hermione shut eyes, squeezed shut really tight, bear start crying again. "I'm horrible person," said wavering voice. "I'm awful, I'm heroic -"  Professor McGonagall's voice sharp, like Hermione made dreadful mistake Transfiguration homework. "Stop foolish, Miss Granger! Horrible whoever you. And heroic - well, Miss Granger, already heard opinion young girls trying involve things even fourteen, I shall lecture again. I shall say absolutely dreadful experience, survived well witch year possibly could. Today allowed cry much like. Tomorrow going back class."  That Hermione knew Professor McGonagall help her. She needed someone scold her, absolved blamed, Professor McGonagall would never her, would never ask much little Ravenclaw girl.  It something Harry Potter help either.  Hermione turned infirmary bed, huddling herself, away Professor McGonagall. "Please," whispered. "I want talk - Headmaster -"   "Hermione."  When Hermione Granger opened eyes second time, saw care-lined face Albus Dumbledore leaning bedside, looking almost though he'd crying, though impossible; Hermione felt another stabbing pang guilt bothered so.  "Minerva said wished speak me," old wizard said.  "I -" Suddenly Hermione know say. Her throat locked up, could stammer, "I - I'm -"  Somehow tone must communicated word, one even say anymore.  "Sorry?" said Dumbledore. "Why, sorry?"  She force words throat. "You telling Harry - pay - I - done Professor McGonagall said, I touched wand -"  "My dear," said Dumbledore, "had pledged House Potter, Harry would attacked Azkaban singlehandedly, quite possibly won. That boy may choose words carefully, I never yet known lie; Boy-Who-Lived power Dark Lord never knew. He would indeed tried break Azkaban, even cost life." The old wizard's voice grew gentler, kinder. "No, Hermione, nothing blame yourself."  "I could made it."  In Dumbledore's eyes small twinkle appeared lost weariness. "Really, Miss Granger? Perhaps Headmistress place, I power stubborn children."  "Harry promised -" Her voice stopped. The awful truth hard speak. "Harry Potter promised - would never help - I told to."  There pause. The distant noises infirmary accompanied Professor McGonagall ceased, Hermione realized, Dumbledore awoken her. From lay bed could see ceiling, top one wall's windows, nothing range vision moved, sounds, could hear them.  "Ah," said Dumbledore. The old wizard sighed heavily. "I suppose possible boy would kept promise."  "I - I -"  "Gone Azkaban will?" Dumbledore said. "Miss Granger, I would ever ask anyone take upon themselves."  "But -" Hermione swallowed. She help notice loophole, anyone wanted get portrait-door Ravenclaw dorm quickly learned pay attention exact wordings. "But take yourself."  "Hermione -" old wizard began.  "Why?" said Hermione's voice, seemed running without mind, now. "Why I braver? I going run front Dementor - Harry - before, I mean, January - - - I -" Why thought sent Azkaban completely unglued her, forgotten everything Good -  "My dear girl," Dumbledore said. The blue eyes behind half-moon glasses showed complete understanding guilt. "I would done better myself, first year Hogwarts. As would kind others, kinder well."  "So I wrong thing." Somehow needed say that, told that, even though already knew.  There pause.  "Listen, young Ravenclaw," old wizard said, "hear well, I shall speak truth. Most ill-doers think evil; indeed, conceive heroes stories tell. I thought greatest evil world done name greater good. I wrong. Terribly wrong. There evil world knows evil, hates good strength. All fair things desire destroy."  Hermione shivered bed, somehow seemed real, Dumbledore said it.  The old wizard continued speaking. "You one fair things world, Hermione Granger, evil hates well. If stayed firm even trial, would struck harder yet harder, shattered. Do think heroes cannot broken! We difficult break, Hermione." The old wizard's eyes grown sterner ever seen. "When exhausted many hours, pain death passing fear certainty, harder hero. If I must speak truth - today, yes, I would waver face Azkaban. But I first-year Hogwarts - I would fled Dementor confronted, father died Azkaban, I feared them. Know this! The evil struck could broken anyone, even myself. Only Harry Potter within face horror, come fully power."  Hermione's neck stare old wizard longer; let head fall back, back pillow, stared ceiling, absorbing could.  "Why?" Her voice trembled again. "Why would anyone evil? I understand."  "I, too, wondered," said Dumbledore's voice, deep sadness it. "For thrice ten years I wondered, I still understand. You I never understand, Hermione Granger. But least I know true evil would say itself, could speak ask evil. It would say, Why not?"  A brief flare indignation inside her. "There's got million reasons not!"  "Indeed," said Dumbledore's voice. "A million reasons more. We always know reasons, I. If insist putting way - yes, Hermione, day's trial broke you. But happens break - that, too, part hero. Which are, Hermione Granger, always be."  She raised head again, staring him.  The old wizard got beside bed. His silver beard dipped down, Dumbledore bowed gravely, left.  She went looking old wizard gone.  It meant something her, touched her. Should made felt better inside, Dumbledore, seemed reluctant before, acknowledged hero.  She felt nothing.  Hermione let head fall back bed, Madam Pomfrey came made drink something seared lips like afterburn spicy food, smelled even hotter, taste like anything all. It meant nothing her. She went staring distant stone tiles ceiling.   Minerva waiting, best hover, beside double doors Hogwarts infirmary, she'd always thought doors "the ominous gates" child Hogwarts, help remember now. Too much bad news spoken -  Albus stepped out. The old wizard pause way infirmary, kept walking toward Professor Flitwick's office; Minerva followed him.  Professor McGonagall cleared throat. "Is done, Albus?"  The old wizard nodded affirmation. "If hostile magic cast her, spirit touches her, I shall know, come."  "I spoke Mr. Potter Transfiguration class," said Professor McGonagall. "He opinion Miss Granger go Beauxbatons, rather Hogwarts, on."  The old wizard shook head. "No. If Voldemort truly desires strike Miss Granger - tenacious beyond measure. His servants returning him, could retrieved Bellatrix alone. Azkaban safe malice, Beauxbatons - no, Minerva. I think Voldemort essay possessions often, stronger targets, year would gone quite differently. And Harry Potter here, Voldemort must fear whether admits no. Now I warded her, Miss Granger safer within Hogwarts without."  "Mr. Potter seemed doubt that," Minerva said. She quite keep edge voice; part agreed rather strongly. "He seemed feel common sense said Miss Granger continue education anywhere Hogwarts."  The old wizard sighed. "I fear boy spent much time among Muggles. Always reach safety; always imagine safety reached. If Miss Granger safe within center fortress, shall safer leaving it."  "Not everyone seems think so," said Professor McGonagall. It almost first letter she'd seen she'd taken quick look desk; envelope finest sheepskin, sealed greenish-silver wax, pressed image snake rose hissed her. "I received Lord Malfoy's owl withdrawing son Hogwarts."  The old wizard nodded, break stride. "Does Harry know?"  "Yes." Her voice faltered, moment, remembering Harry's expression. "After class, Mr. Potter complimented Lord Malfoy's excellent good sense, said would writing Madam Longbottom advising grandson, case next target. In event Mr. Longbottom's guardian negligent keep Hogwarts, Mr. Potter wanted Time-Turner, invisibility cloak, broomstick, pouch carry them; also toe-ring emergency portkey safe location, case someone kidnaps Mr. Longbottom takes outside Hogwarts's wards. I told Mr. Potter I think Ministry would consent use Time-Turners, said ask. I expect want Miss Granger receive same, stays. And Mr. Potter wants three-person broomstick carry pouch." She awed list precautions. Impressed cleverness, awed; Transfiguration Mistress, all. But still sent shivers disquiet her, Harry Potter thought Hogwarts dangerous spell research.  "The Department Mysteries lightly defied," said Albus. "But rest -" The old wizard seemed slump slightly. "We may well give boy wishes. And I ward Neville also, write Augusta say stay holiday."  "And finally," said, "Mr. Potter says - direct quote, Albus - whatever kind Dark Wizard attractant Headmaster keeping here, needs get school, now." She stop edge voice, time.  "I asked much Flamel," Albus said, pain clear voice. "But Master Flamel said - even longer keep safe Stone - believes Voldemort means finding wherever hidden - consent guarded anywhere Hogwarts. Minerva, I sorry, must done - must!"  "Very well," said Professor McGonagall. "But myself, I think Mr. Potter right every single count."  The old wizard glanced her, voice caught said, "Minerva, known long, well soul still living - tell me, I lost darkness already?"  "What?" said Professor McGonagall genuine surprise. Then, "Oh, Albus, no!"  The old wizard's lips pressed together tightly spoke. "For greater good. I sacrificed many, greater good. Today I almost condemned Hermione Granger Azkaban greater good. And I find - today, I found - beginning resent innocence longer mine -" The old wizard's voice halted. "Evil done name good. Evil done name evil. Which worse?"  "You silly, Albus."  The old wizard glanced again, turning eyes back way. "Tell me, Minerva - pause weigh consequences, told Miss Granger bind Potter family?"  She took involuntary breath understood done -  "So not." Albus's eyes saddened. "No, Minerva, must apologize. It well. For seen day - first loyalty Harry Potter, me, right proper." She opened lips protest, Albus went could say word. "Indeed - indeed - necessary necessary, Dark Lord Harry must defeat come power Voldemort -"  "Not again!" Minerva said. "Albus, You-Know-Who, you, marked Harry equal. There possible way prophecy could talking you!"  The old wizard nodded, eyes still seemed distant, fixed road ahead.   The holding cell, well center Magical Law Enforcement, luxuriously appointed; remark adult wizards took granted, special feeling toward prisoners. There self-reclining, self-rocking chair plush, richly textured, self-warming cushions. There bookcase containing random books rescued bargain bin, full shelf ancient magazines, including one 1883. As toiletries, well, exactly luxurious, spell room put business hold; go anywhere watching Auror see you. But aside that, quite pleasant little cell. The Defense Professor Hogwarts detained, arrested, even intimidated. There evidence indict him... except terrible unusual crime committed Hogwarts School Witchcraft Wizardry, going previous occasions odds five one current Defense Professor tangled somehow. To must added fact nobody D.M.L.E. even knew Defense Professor was, man literally sneezed attempts uncover true identity. Why, no, released 'Quirinus Quirrell' back Hogwarts yet.  Let us repeat emphasis:  The Defense Professor.  Was detained.  In cell.  The Defense Professor staring watching Auror humming.  The Defense Professor spoken single word since arrived particular cell. He humming.  The humming started simple children's lullaby, one Muggle Britain begins, Lullaby, goodnight...  This tune hummed, without variation, over, seven minutes, establish underlying pattern.  Then began elaborations upon theme. Phrases hummed slow, long pauses between, listener's mind helplessly waits waits next note, next phrase. And then, next phrase comes, key, unbelievably awfully key, key previous phrases sung pitch correspond key, would believe person spent hours deliberately practicing humming acquire perfect anti-pitch.  It bears semblance music awful dead voice Dementor bears human speech.  And horrible, horrible humming impossible ignore. It similar known lullaby, departs pattern unpredictably. It sets expectations violates them, never constant pattern would permit humming fade background. The listener's brain cannot prevent expecting anti-musical phrases complete, prevent noticing surprises.  The possible explanation mode humming came exist deliberately designed unspeakably cruel genius woke one day, feeling bored ordinary torture, decided handicap find whether could break someone's sanity humming them.  The Auror listening unimaginably dreadful humming four hours, stared huge, cold, lethal presence feels equally horrible whether looks directly lets hover corner vision -  The humming stopped.  There long wait. Time enough false hope rise, squashed memory previous disappointments. And then, interval lengthened, lengthened, hope rose unstoppably -  The humming began more.  The Auror cracked.  From belt, Auror took mirror, tapped once, said, "This Junior Auror Arjun Altunay, I'm calling code RJ-L20 cell three."  "Code RJ-L20?" mirror said surprised tones. There sound pages flipped, then, "You want relieved prisoner attempting psychological warfare succeeding?"  (Amelia Bones really quite intelligent.)  "What'd prisoner say you?" said mirror.  (This question part procedure RJ-L20, unfortunately Amelia Bones failed include explicit instruction commanding officer ask.)  "He's -" said Auror, glanced back cell. The Defense Professor leaning back chair, looking quite relaxed. "He staring me! And humming!"  There pause.  The mirror spoke again. "And calling RJ-L20 that? You're sure trying get watching him?"  (Amelia Bones surrounded idiots.)  "You understand!" yelled Auror Altunay. "It's really awful humming!"  The mirror transmitted sound muffled laughter background, sounding like coming one person. Then speech again. "Mr. Altunay, want busted Junior Auror Second Class, I suggest buckle get back work -"  "Strike that," crisp voice said, sounding slightly remote due distance mirror.  (Which Amelia Bones often sits coordination center D.M.L.E. Ministry-required paperwork.)  "Auror Altunay," said crisp voice, seeming approach closer mirror, "you relieved shortly. Auror Ben Gutierrez, procedure RJ-L20 say ask why. It says relieve Auror calls in. If I find Aurors seem abusing it, I modify procedure prevent abuse -" The mirror cut abruptly.  The Auror turned back look triumphantly current Defense Professor Hogwarts leaning back cushioned chair.  That man spoke first words left lips since entered cell.  "Goodbye, Mr. Altunay," said Defense Professor.  A minutes later, door detention cell opened, walked grey-haired woman, dressed crimson-tinged robes Auror without sign rank ornamentation, carrying black leather folder left arm. "You're relieved," old woman said abruptly.  There brief delay Auror Altunay tried explain happening. This cut short nod stark, simple finger pointing door.  "Good evening, Madam Director," said Defense Professor.  Amelia Bones acknowledge statement, sat abruptly vacated chair. The old witch opened black folder gaze moved parchments therein. "Possible hints identity current Hogwarts Defense Professor, compiled Auror Robards." The title parchment turned, flipped aside. "The Defense Professor said Sorted Slytherin. Claimed family killed Voldemort. Said studied martial arts center Muggle Asia destroyed Voldemort. A request filed Department International Magical Cooperation identifies incident Oni Affair 1969." Another parchment flipped aside. "It also seems Defense Professor gave stirring speech students, last Yule, castigating previous generation disunity Death Eaters." The old witch looked leather folder. "Madam Longbottom rather taken it, insisted I read entire thing. The argument struck familiar, though I could place time. But then, course, I thought dead."  The chief law enforcement officer Magical Britain gazing sharply current Defense Professor Hogwarts, across pane spell-reinforced glass separating them. The man cell returned gaze equably, without apparent alarm.  "I shall name names," said old witch. "But I shall tell story, see sounds familiar." Amelia Bones looked back down, turning next parchment. "Born 1927, entered Hogwarts 1938, sorted Slytherin, graduated 1945. Went graduation tour abroad disappeared visiting Albania. Presumed dead 1970, returned magical Britain suddenly, without explanation missing twenty-five years. He remained estranged family friends, living isolation. In 1971, visiting Diagon Alley, fended attempt Bellatrix Black kidnap daughter Minister Magic, used Killing Curse slay two three Death Eaters accompanying her. Beyond Britain knows story; need I continue it?" The old witch looked folder again. "Very well. There trial Wizengamot, young man exonerated use Killing Curse, least due efforts grandmother, Lady House. He reconciled family, held House gathering welcome return. The guest honor arrived gathering find entire family slain Death Eaters, even house elves; himself, cadet line, last remaining scion Most Ancient House."  The Defense Professor reacted this, except eyes half-closed, though weariness.  "The young man took family's seat Wizengamot, becoming among steadfast voices You-Know-Who. Several times led forces Death Eaters, fighting skillful tactics extraordinary power. People began speak next Dumbledore, thought might become Minister Magic Dark Lord fell. On third July, 1973, failed appear key Wizengamot vote, never heard again. We assumed You-Know-Who killed him. It grave blow us, matters went much worse day on." The old witch's gaze questioning. "I mourned myself. What happened?"  The Defense Professor's shoulders moved lightly, small shrug. "You make many assumptions," Defense Professor said softly. "For myself, I would believe man died years ago. But man nonetheless alive - clear wish fact announced, reasons enough silence. That man help you, seems." The Defense Professor's lips curved cynical smile. "But I longer surprised gratitude fleeting. Is yet would demand him?"  The old witch leaned back Auror's monitoring-chair, looking rather startled, maybe even hurt. "No -" said moment. Her fingers tapped leather folder; nervously, might thought, believed Amelia Bones could ever nervous. "But House - many Ancient Houses remaining -"  "It shall matter little country whether eight Ancient Houses remain, seven."  The old witch sighed. "What Dumbledore think this?"  The man detention cell shook head. "He know I am, promised inquire."  The old witch's eyebrows rose. "How identify Hogwarts wards, then?"  A slight smile. "The Headmaster drew circle, told Hogwarts stood within Defense Professor. Speaking -" The tone went lower, flatter. "I missing classes, Director Bones."  "You seem - rest, sometimes, peculiar manner. This also reported. And seem resting more frequently, time goes on." The old witch's fingers tapped leather folder again. "I cannot recall reading symptom, one hears thing, one imagines... Dark Wizards fought, terrible curses received..."  The Defense Professor remained expressionless.  "Do require healer's help?" said Amelia Bones. Her mask slipped, clearly showing pain eyes. "Is anything done you?"  "I agreed teach Defense Hogwarts," man cell said flatly. "Draw conclusions, Madam. And I missing classes, many left. I would return Hogwarts, now."   When Hermione woke third time (though felt like she'd closed eyes moment) Sun even lower sky, almost fully set. She felt little alive and, strangely, even exhausted. This time Professor Flitwick standing next bed shaking shoulder, tray steaming food floating next him. For reason she'd thought Harry Potter ought leaning bedside, there. Had dreamed that? She remember dreaming.  It developed (according Professor Flitwick) Hermione missed dinner Great Hall, woken eat. And could go back Ravenclaw dorm, bed, sleep rest night.  She ate silence. There part wanted ask Professor Flitwick whether thought she'd Memory-Charmed she'd tried kill Draco Malfoy -  - like remembered -  - afraid find out. Afraid find warning sign, according Harry Potter books; mind felt tired, bruised, muster strength override it.  When Professor Flitwick left infirmary found Harry Potter sitting cross-legged outside door, quietly reading psychology textbook.  "I'll take here," said Boy-Who-Lived. "Professor McGonagall said would right."  Professor Flitwick seemed accept this, departed stern look them. She imagine stern look supposed say, unless try kill students.  The footsteps Professor Flitwick faded, two stood alone outside doors infirmary.  She looked green eyes Boy-Who-Lived, mess hair quite obscure scar forehead; looked upon face boy who'd given money save without second thought. There feelings inside - guilt, shame, embarrassment, things well - words. There nothing knew say.  "So," Harry said abruptly, "I quick skim psychology books see said post-traumatic stress disorder. The old books said talk experience immediately afterward counselor. The newer research says actually ran experiments, turned talking immediately afterward made worse. Apparently really ought run mind's natural impulse repress memories think while."  It normal way Harry usually talked felt sudden burning throat.  We talk it. That Harry said, less. It felt like cheating, maybe even like lie. Nothing normal. Everything wrong still horribly wrong, everything left unsaid still needed said...  "Okay," said Hermione, anything else say, anything else all.  "I'm sorry I waiting woke up," Harry said, started walk. "Madam Pomfrey let in, I stayed here." He gave small, sad-looking shrug. "I suppose I trying run damage control public relations, but... honestly I've never good that, I end speaking sharply people."  "How bad it?" She thought voice come whisper, croak, didn't.  "Well -" Harry said obvious hesitation. "The thing got understand, Hermione, lot defenders breakfast-time today, everyone side was... making stuff up. Draco tried kill first, things like that. It Granger versus Malfoy, that's people saw it, like seesaw pushing side meant pushing side up. I told probably innocent, Memory-Charmed. They listen, sides treated like traitor trying play middle. And people heard Draco testified Veritaserum he'd trying help battle - stop making expression, Hermione, actually anything him. Anyway, people understood pro-Malfoy faction right pro-Granger faction wrong." Harry gave small sigh. "I told truth came later they'd embarrassed..."  "How bad it?" said again. This time voice come weaker.  "Remember Asch's conformity experiment?" Harry said, turning head give serious look.  Her mind slow remember seconds, frightened her, reference came back. In 1951, Solomon Asch taken experimental subjects, one put among row people looked like them, seeming like experimental subjects, actually confederates experimenter. They'd shown reference line screen, labeled X, next three lines, labeled A, B, C. The experimenter asked line X length as. The correct answer obviously C. The 'subjects', confederates, one another said X length B. The real subject put second-to-last order, arouse suspicion last. The test see whether real subject would 'conform' standard wrong answer B, voice obviously correct answer C.  75% subjects 'conformed' least once. A third subjects conformed half time. Some reported afterward actually believing X length B. And case subjects known confederates. If put people around others belonged group them, like someone wheelchair next people wheelchair, conformity effect got even stronger...  Hermione sickening feeling going. "I remember," whispered.  "I gave Chaos Legion anti-conformity training, know. I Legionnaire stand middle say 'Twice two four!' 'Grass green!' everyone else Chaos Legion called idiots sneered - Allen Flint really good sneers - even gave blank looks walked away. The thing got remember is, Chaos Legion ever practiced anything like that. Nobody else Hogwarts even knows conformity is."  "Harry!" Her voice wobbling. "How bad it?"  Harry gave another sad-looking shrug. "Everyone second year above, since know you. Everyone Dragon Army. All Slytherin, course. And, well, rest magical Britain too, I think. Remember, Lucius Malfoy controls Daily Prophet."  "Everyone?" whispered. Her limbs started feel cold, like she'd gotten unheated swimming pool.  "What people really believe feel like belief, feels like way world is. You I standing private little bubble universe Hermione Granger got Memory-Charmed. Everyone else living world Hermione Granger tried murder Draco Malfoy. If Ernie Macmillian -"  Her breath caught throat. Captain Macmillian -  "- thinks he's ethically prohibited friend now, well, he's trying right thing understands it, world thinks lives in." Harry's eyes serious. "Hermione, told lot times I look much people. But I expected much - I expected people get things right - I really would hate them, then. Idealism aside, Hogwarts students actually know enough cognitive science take responsibility minds work. It's fault they're crazy." Harry's voice strangely gentle, almost like adult's. "I know going harder would me. But remember, eventually real culprit gets nailed. The truth comes out, everyone confidently wrong gets embarrassed."  "And real culprit get caught?" said trembling voice.  ...or turns all?  "Then leave Hogwarts go Salem Witches' Institute America."  "Leave Hogwarts?" She'd never even thought possibility except ultimate punishment.  "I... Hermione, I think might want anyway. Hogwarts castle, insanity walls. You got options."  "I'll..." stammered. "I'll have... think it..."  Harry nodded. " At least nobody's going try hexing you, Headmaster said dinner tonight. Oh, Ron Weasley came me, looking serious, told I saw first, I tell he's sorry thought badly you, he'll never speak ill again."  "Ron believes I'm innocent?" said Hermione.  "Well... think innocent, per se..."   The whole Ravenclaw dorm went silent two walked in.  Staring them.  Staring her.  (She'd nightmares like this.)  And then, one one, people looked away her.  Penelope Clearwater, 5th-year prefect charge first-years, looked away slowly deliberately, turning head face another direction.  Su Li Lisa Turpin Michael Corner, sitting table together, she'd helped homework one time another, looked away, faces suddenly nervous, moment tried catch eyes.  A third-year witch named Latisha Randle, S.P.H.E.W. twice saved Slytherin bullies, quickly bent back desk started homework again.  Mandy Brocklehurst looked away her.  If Hermione burst tears, then, she'd expected it, played mind over again. At least people screaming shoving hexing her. They looking away -  Hermione walked straight staircaise led toward first-year girl's dorms. (She see Padma Patil Anthony Goldstein looking her, two lone heads turning track left.) From behind her, heard Harry Potter saying calm tone, "Now eventually truth's going come out, all. So confident guilty, I ask sign paper right here, saying later turns innocent, gets say 'I told so' hold rest lives? Step up, one all, cowards, really believe afraid bet -"  She halfway stairs realized would girls inside dorm room, too.   The stars quite come yet, one two brightest ones visible reddish-purple haze horizon, though sun fully sunk.  Hermione's hands dug harsh stone parapet guarding small balcony, she'd ducked stairwell realizing -  - go back bed -  - words echoed mind like 'You can't go home again' ought sound.  She stared empty grounds, fading sunset, sprouting grass far below.  Tired, tired, think now, needed sleep. Professor Flitwick told needed sleep, there'd yet another potion dinner. Maybe wizarding society treated horrible traumas innocent young girls, made sleep lot afterward.  She go room sleep, afraid go someplace people were. Afraid might look her, look away.  Fragments thought chased around mind exhausted finish connect them, night fully set in.  Why -  Why happen -  Everything fine week ago -  Why -  From behind came creaky sound opening door.  She turned head looked.  Professor Quirrell leaning doorway she'd walked through, silhouetted like cardboard cutout light Hogwarts torches lit behind him, open door. She see expression, though doorway behind bright; eyes, face, everything could see lay within night's shadow.  The Defense Professor Hogwarts, number one list people might've done this. She even realized suspect list moment.  The man stood within doorway, saying nothing; see eyes. What even first place -  "Are kill me?" said Hermione Granger.  Professor Quirrell's head tilted that.  Then Defense Professor started toward her, dark silhouette raising one hand slowly deliberately, though push Ravenclaw tower -  "Stupefy!"  The burst adrenaline overrode everything, drew wand without thinking, lips formed word accord, stunbolt leapt wand -  - slowed stop front Professor Quirrell's raised hand, rippling midair like still trying fly making slight hissing sound.  The red glow illuminated Professor Quirrell's face first time, showing strange fond smile.  "Better," said Professor Quirrell. "Miss Granger, still student Defense class. As such, consider threat, I expect look sadly ask I kill you. Minus two Quirrell points."  She entirely unable form words.  The Defense Professor flicked forefinger casually suspended stunbolt, sending hex shooting back head, far night, stood darkness. Then Professor Quirrell walked doorway, swung shut behind him; soft white light sprung around two them, could see face more, still strange fond smile.  "What - here?"  A steps took Professor Quirrell higher part balcony's ramparts, put elbows stone, leaned heavily, looking night.  "I came straight upon released Aurors, moment I finished reporting Headmaster," said Professor Quirrell quiet voice, "because I teacher, student, I responsible you."  Hermione understood, then; remembering Professor Quirrell said Harry second Defense lesson year, controlling anger. She felt flush shame way chest. It took moment knowledge override mortification, force words -  "I -" said Hermione. "Harry thinks - I - lose temper, I mean -"  "So I heard," said Professor Quirrell rather dry tones. He shook head, though stars themselves. "The boy fortunate I crossed line annoyance self-destructiveness, sheer curiosity shall next. But I agree Mr. Potter's assessment facts. This murder well-planned evade detection wards Hogwarts Headmaster's timely eye. Naturally, thoughtful murder, innocent would placed take blame." A brief, wry smile crossed Defense Professor's lips, though looking her. "As notion - I consider talented teacher, even I could teach murderous intent student obstinate untalented Hermione Granger."  The part brain said What? indignation anywhere near loud enough reach lips.  "No..." said Professor Quirrell. "That I here. You made effort hide dislike me, Miss Granger. I thank lack pretense, I much prefer true hate false love. But still student, I word say you, hear it."  Hermione looked him, still fighting aftereffects adrenaline before. The Defense Professor seemed staring dark sky, stars becoming visible.  "I going hero, once," said Professor Quirrell, still looking upward. "Can believe that, Miss Granger?"  "No."  "Thank again, Miss Granger. It true nonetheless. Long ago, long time Harry Potter's, man hailed savior. The destined scion, one anyone would recognize tales, wielding justice vengeance like twin wands dreadful nemesis." Professor Quirrell gave soft, bitter laugh, looking night sky. "Do know, Miss Granger, time I thought already cynical, yet... well."  The silence stretched, cold night.  "In honesty," said Professor Quirrell, looking stars, "I still understand it. They known lives depended man's success. And yet tried everything could make life unpleasant. To throw every possible obstacle way. I naive, Miss Granger, I expect power-holders align quickly - without something themselves. But power, too, threatened; I shocked seemed content step back, leave man burdens responsibility. They sneered performance, remarking among would better place, though condescend step forward." Professor Quirrell shook head though bemusement. "And strangest thing - Dark Wizard, man's dread nemesis - why, served leapt eagerly tasks. The Dark Wizard grew crueler toward followers, followed more. Men fought chance serve him, even whose lives depended man made free render life difficult... I could understand it, Miss Granger." Professor Quirrell's face shadow, looked upward. "Perhaps, taking curse action, man removed others? Was felt free hinder battle Dark Wizard would enslaved all? Believing men would act interest cynicism, turned out, sheerest optimism; reality men meet high standard. And time one realized might better fighting Dark Wizard alone, followers back."  "So -" Hermione's voice sounded strange night. "You left friends behind they'd safe, tried attack Dark Wizard yourself?"  "Why, no," said Professor Quirrell. "I stopped trying hero, went something else I found pleasant."  "What?" said Hermione without thinking all. "That's horrible!"  The Defense Professor turned head sky regard her; saw, light doorway, smiling - least half face smiling. "Are going tell me, Miss Granger, I awful person? Well, perhaps I am. But people never even try heroes still worse? If I never done anything all, like them, would thought better me?"  Hermione opened mouth found that, again, anything say. It right walk away hero, that, want say everyone hero nothing, Quirrell-thinking...  The smile, half-smile, disappeared. "You foolish," Defense Professor said quietly, "to expect lasting gratitude tried protect, named heroine. Just expected man go hero, called horrible stopping, thousand others never lifted finger. It expected fight bullies. It tax owed, accepted like princes, sneer lateness payment. And already witnessed, I wager, fondness vanished like dust wind longer interest associate you..."  The Defense Professor slowly straightened balcony, standing almost straight, turning regard fully.  "But hero, Miss Granger," said Professor Quirrell. "You stop anytime please."  That idea...  ...had occurred before, several times last two days.  People become meant be, right, Headmaster Dumbledore told her. The trouble seemed two different right things do. There part said right go heroine, stay Hogwarts, know going heroine run away.  And also voice common sense saying young children ever stay around danger, adults for; voice every school poster said take candy strangers. That also right.  Hermione Granger stood balcony, looking Professor Quirrell silhouetted emerging stars, understand; understand Defense Professor could gazing face showing concern; understand notes pain Defense Professor's voice caught her; understand told this.  "You even like me, Professor," said Hermione.  A small smile flickered Professor Quirrell's face. "I suppose I could go I angered affair taken valuable time disrupted Defense classes. But mostly, Miss Granger, student, whatever professions I may held, I think I good teacher Hogwarts, I not?" Suddenly Professor Quirrell's eyes seemed tired. "As teacher, then, I advising career options. I like see anyone else going path."  Hermione swallowed. It side Professor Quirrell she'd never seen imagined, eating away preconceptions.  Professor Quirrell watched moment, looked away again, back stars. When spoke time voice quieter. "Someone targeting you, Miss Granger, I cannot ward I warded Mr. Malfoy. The Headmaster prevented it, claims good reasons. It easy become fond Hogwarts, I know, I fond well. But France take different view Ancient Houses Britain; Beauxbatons would mistreat you, I think. Whatever else imagine me, I swear asked see safely Beauxbatons, I would power convey there."  "I can't -" Hermione said.  "But can, Miss Granger." Now pale blue eyes watched intently. "Whatever wish make life, cannot attain Hogwarts, anymore. This place ruined now, even leaving aside threats. Simply ask Harry Potter command go Beauxbatons live life peace. If stay here, master eyes Britain laws!"  She even thinking that, paled much comparison eaten Dementors; important before, seemed childish, unimportant, pointless, eyes burning?  "And fails move you, Miss Granger, consider also Mr. Potter has, today lunchtime, threatened Lucius Malfoy, Albus Dumbledore, entire Wizengamot cannot think sensibly something threatens take him. Are frightened next?"  It made sense. Terrible sense. Dreadful awful sense.  It made much sense -  She described words, triggered realization, unless sheer pressure Defense Professor exerting her.  That Defense Professor behind whole thing - Professor Quirrell done get way plans Harry.  Without conscious decision, shifted weight foot, body moving away Defense Professor -  "So think I one responsible?" said Professor Quirrell. His voice sounded little sad said it, heart almost stopped hearing it. "I suppose I cannot blame you. I Defense Professor Hogwarts, all. But Miss Granger, even assuming I enemy, common sense still tell get away quickly. You cannot use Killing Curse, correct tactic Apparate away. I mind villain imagination makes matters clearer. Leave Hogwarts, leave handle me. I arrange transportation family good repute, Mr. Potter know blame arrive safely."  "I -" She feeling cold, night air chilling skin, maybe chilled it. "I've got think -"  Professor Quirrell shook head. "No, Miss Granger. Your departure take time arrange, I less time left may think. This decision may painful you, ambiguous; much weighs balance scales, evenly. I must know tonight whether intend go."  And -  Was Defense Professor warning deliberately? That run, would strike again?  Why would matter much, Professor Quirrell want Harry?  Hermione Granger, I shall less subtle usual mysterious old wizard, tell outright cannot imagine badly things could go events surrounding Harry Potter turn ill.  The powerful wizard world told that, talking important stop Harry's friend.  Hermione swallowed, swayed little stood, stone balcony magical castle. Suddenly whole deadly absurdity situation seemed rise grab throat, twelve-year-old girls danger, thinking things, Mum would want RUN AWAY father would heart attack even knew faced question.  And knew, then, Harry Dumbledore tried warn her, everything she'd ever thought heroine mistaken. That really thing heroes, outside stories. There horrible danger, arrested Aurors put cells next Dementors, pain fear -  "Miss Granger?" said Defense Professor.  She said nothing. All words blocked throat.  "I need decision, Miss Granger."  She kept jaw locked, let words come out.  Finally Defense Professor sighed. Slowly white light failed, slowly door behind swung open, black silhouette opening. "Good night, Miss Granger," said, turned back her, walked away Hogwarts.  It took breathing slow again. Whatever happened tonight, feel anything like victory. She'd fought hard stop saying Yes face Defense Professor's pressure, even know she'd done right thing.  Then walked back light herself, started climbing stairs toward dorm room.  The girls probably asleep now, look her, look away -  She felt tears start, time stop them.   Chapter 85: Taboo Tradeoffs, Aftermath 3, Distance  Slow hard, long stairway led peak Ravenclaw. From inside, stairway seemed like straight upward slope, though outside could see logically spiral. You could get top Ravenclaw tower making long climb, without shortcuts, stone step stone step, passed beneath Harry's shoes, pushed wearying legs.  Harry seen Hermione safely bed.  He lingered Ravenclaw common room long enough collect signatures might useful Hermione later. Not many students signed; wizards trained think put-up-or-shut-up, stick-your-neck-out-and-make-a-prediction-or-stop-pretending-to-believe-in-your-theory rules Muggle science. Most seen anything incongruent nervous sign agreement saying Hermione got hold rest lives wrong, acting outwardly confident guilty. But demanded signatures would make point truth came out, anyone ever suspected Hermione anything Dark. She go twice, least.  After Harry left common room quickly, kindly forgiving sentiments he'd reasoned getting harder harder remember. Sometimes Harry thought deepest split personality anything dark side; rather divide altruistic forgiving Abstract Reasoning Harry, versus frustrated angry Harry In The Moment.  The circular platform top Ravenclaw tower tallest place Hogwarts, Ravenclaw tower jutted main body castle, see top platform Astronomy tower. A quiet place think, awful lot think about. A place students ever came - easier niches privacy, privacy wanted.  The night-lit torches Hogwarts far below. The platform offered obstructions; stairs emerged uncovered gap floor, rather upright door. From place, then, stars visible ever Earth.  The boy lay center platform, heedless robes might dirtied, dropping head rest upon rock-tiled floor; that, except half-seen crenellations stone vision's edge, sliver crescent moon, reality became starlight.  The pinpoints light dark velvet twinkled, wavering returning, different kind beauty steady brilliance Silent Night.  Harry gazed abstractly, mind things.  This day war Voldemort begun...  Dumbledore said that, Incident Rescuing Bellatrix Azkaban. That false alarm, phrase expressed sentiment well.  Two nights ago war begun, Harry know who.  Dumbledore thought Lord Voldemort, returned dead, making first move boy defeated last time.  Professor Quirrell put detection wards Draco, fearing Hogwarts's mad Headmaster would try frame Harry death Lucius's son.  Or Professor Quirrell set entire thing, he'd known find Draco. Severus Snape thought Hogwarts Defense Professor obvious suspect, even obvious suspect.  And Severus Snape might might even remotely trustworthy.  Someone declared war Harry, first strike meant take Draco Hermione both, barest margins Harry saved Hermione.  You call victory. Draco removed Hogwarts, death, clear could undone, shape Draco might got back. The country magical Britain thought Hermione attempted-murderer, might might make decide sane thing leave. Harry sacrificed entire fortune undo loss, card could played once.  Some unknown power struck him, blow partially deflected, still hit really hard.  And Harry knew who...  ...kill them?  No, said voices Harry's mind seized moment speak. Even dark side, different opinion, remained silent. His dark side asked anything exchange saving Hermione, either. Maybe dark side imaginary voice like Hufflepuff; Harry might imagine Hufflepuff part wanting different things himself, dark side like that. His "dark side", far Harry could tell, different way Harry sometimes was. Right now, Harry angry; trying ask "dark Harry" wanted phone ringing unanswered. The thought even seemed little strange; could owe something different way sometimes were?  In quiet moment, thought killing two-thirds Wizengamot seemed foreign horrifying thought properly been, civilized eleven-year-old.  So, said another part Harry, catch enemy, put Dementor-free prison, break loose kill people? Are sure beyond reasonable doubt safely hold Lord Voldemort himself, even Death stopped before? If Professor Quirrell bad guy, could possibly make non-dangerous except killing him?  It sort question would wise decide advance, going fight war. If needed kill, might able spare second hesitate. Or wisest path obey Batman's code nonlethality, wanted decide calm, think middle battle.  Harry stared random stars, scattered twinkling lights human brains help pattern-match imaginary constellations.  And promise Harry sworn.  Draco help Harry reform Slytherin House. And Harry take enemy whoever Harry believed, best judgment rationalist, killed Narcissa Malfoy. If Narcissa never gotten hands dirty, indeed she'd burned alive, killer tricked - conditions Harry could remember making. He probably written down, better yet, never made promise requiring many caveats first place.  There plausible outs, sort person who'd take out. Dumbledore actually confessed. He come right said he'd done it. There plausible reasons actually-guilty Dumbledore behave way. But also expect see, someone else burned Narcissa, Dumbledore taken credit.  And odds would bet that, said Voice Contrary Argument, personal stake issue? Uncertainty excuse inaction. There's least substantial probability Dumbledore killed her; take quantitatively proportional step toward making enemy?  Harry shook head, flattening one side hair another stone-tiled floor. There still final out, Draco could still release oath time. He could, least, describe situation Draco, talk options him, met again. It seem like likely prospect release - idea talking something honestly enough satisfy part demanded adherence oaths. Even meant delaying, better taking good man enemy.  But Dumbledore good man? asked voice Hufflepuff. If Dumbledore burned someone alive - whole point good people may kill, never kill suffering?  Maybe killed instantly, said Slytherin, lied Lucius burning-alive part. But... possibility Death Eaters magically verifying Narcissa died... caught lie would've endangered Light-side families...  Be careful cleverly rationalize, warned Gryffindor.  You expect reputational effects people treat you, said Hufflepuff. If decide there's sufficient reason burn woman alive, one predictable side effects good people decide crossed line stopped. Dumbledore expected that. He's got right complain.  Or maybe expects us smarter, said Slytherin. Now know much truth - matter exact details full story - really believe Dumbledore terrible, terrible person ought enemy? In middle horrible bloody war, Dumbledore set one enemy civilian fire? That's bad standards comic books, sort realistic historical standard.  Harry stared night sky, remembering history.  In real life, real wars...  During World War II, project sabotage Nazi nuclear weapons program. Years earlier, Leo Szilard, first person world foresee possibility fission chain reaction, convinced Fermi publish fact purified graphite cheap effective neutron moderator. Fermi wanted publish, sake great international project science, nationalism. But Szilard persuaded Rabi, Fermi abided majority vote tiny three-person conspiracy. And so, years later, neutron moderator Nazis known deuterium.  The deuterium source Nazi control captured facility occupied Norway, knocked bombs sabotage, causing total twenty-four civilian deaths.  The Nazis tried ship deuterium already refined, board civilian Norwegian ferry, SS Hydro.  Knut Haukelid assistants discovered night watchman civilian ferry sneaking board sabotage it. Haukelid told watchman escaping Gestapo, watchman let go. Haukelid considered warning night watchman, would endangered mission, Haukelid shaken hand. And civilian ship sunk deepest part lake, eight dead Germans, seven dead crew, three dead civilian bystanders. Some Norwegian rescuers ship thought German soldiers present left drown, view prevailed, German survivors rescued. And end Nazi nuclear weapons program.  Which say Knut Haukelid killed innocent people. One whom, night watchman ship, good person. Someone who'd gone way help Haukelid, risk himself; kindness heart, highest moral reasons; sent drown turn. Afterward, cold light history, looked like Nazis never close getting nuclear weapons all.  And Harry never read anything suggesting Haukelid acted wrongly.  That war real life. In terms total damage who'd gotten hit, Haukelid done considerably worse Dumbledore might done Narcissa Malfoy, Dumbledore possibly done leak prophecy Lord Voldemort get attack Harry's parents.  If Haukelid comic-book superhero, he'd somehow gotten civilians ferry, would've attacked German soldiers directly...  ...rather let single innocent person die...  ...but Knut Haukelid superhero.  And neither Albus Dumbledore.  Harry closed eyes, swallowing hard times sudden choking sensation. It abruptly clear Harry going around trying live ideals Enlightenment, Dumbledore one who'd actually fought war. Nonviolent ideals cheap hold scientist, living inside Protego bubble cast police officers soldiers whose actions luxury question. Albus Dumbledore seemed started ideals least strong Harry's own, stronger; Dumbledore gotten war without losing friends killing enemies sacrificing allies.  Are much better Haukelid Dumbledore, Harry Potter, able fight without single casualty? Even world comic books, reason superhero like Batman even looks successful comic-book readers notice Important Named Characters die, Joker shoots random nameless bystander show villainy. Batman murderer less Joker, lives Joker took Batman could've saved killing him. That's man named Alastor trying tell Dumbledore, afterward Dumbledore regretted taken long change mind. Are really going try follow path superhero, never sacrifice single piece kill single enemy?  Fatigued, Harry turned attention away dilemma moment, opened eyes regard hemisphere night, required decisions him.  Near edge vision, pale white crescent Moon, light left one-and-a-quarter seconds ago, around 375,000 kilometers distance Earth's space simultaneity.  Above side, Polaris, North Star, first star Harry learned identify sky following edge Big Dipper; actually five-system brilliant central supergiant, 434 light-years Earth. It first star whose name Harry ever learned, long ago guessed old he'd been.  The dim fog Milky Way; many billions distant stars became indistinct river, plane galaxy stretched 100,000 light-years across.  In center constellation Andromeda, star Andromeda, really Andromeda Galaxy. The nearest galaxy Milky Way, 2.4 million light-years away, containing estimated trillion stars.  Numbers like made 'infinity' pale comparison, 'infinity' featureless blank. Thinking stars 'infinitely' distant lot less scary trying work 2.4 million light-years amounted meters. 2.4 million light-years, times 31 million seconds year, times photon moving 300,000,000 meters per second...  It strange think distances might unreachably far away. Magic loose universe, things like Time-Turners broomsticks. Had anyone even measured speed portkey, phoenix? And human understanding magic possibly anywhere near underlying laws. What would able magic really understood it?  A year ago, Dad gone Australian National University Canberra conference he'd invited speaker, he'd taken Mum Harry along. And they'd visited National Museum Australia, because, turned out, basically nothing else Canberra. The glass display cases shown rock-throwers crafted Australian aborigines - like giant wooden shoehorns, they'd looked, smoothed carved ornamented painstaking care. In 40,000 years since anatomically modern humans migrated Australia Asia, nobody invented bow-and-arrow. It really made appreciate non-obvious idea Progress. Why would even think Invention something important, history's heroic tales great warriors defenders instead Thomas Edison? How could anyone possibly suspected, carving rock-thrower painstaking care, someday human beings would invent rocket ships nuclear energy?  Could looked sky, brilliant light Sun, deduced universe contained greater sources energy mere fire? Would realized fundamental physical laws permitted it, someday humans would tap energies Sun? Even nothing could imagine rock-throwers woven pouches - pattern running across savannah nothing could obtain hunting animals - would accomplish even imagination?  It like modern-day Muggles gotten anywhere near limits Muggle physics said possible. And yet, like ancient hunter-gatherers conceptually bound rock-throwers, Muggles lived world defined limits could cars telephones. Even though Muggle physics explicitly permitted possibilities like molecular nanotechnology Penrose process extracting energy black holes, people filed away section brain stored fairy tales history books, well away personal realities: Long ago far away, ever long ago. It surprise all, then, wizarding world lived conceptual universe bounded - fundamental laws magic nobody even knew - rather surface rules known Charms enchantments. You observe way magic practiced nowadays reminded National Museum Australia, realized seeing. Even Harry's first guess mistaken, one way another still inconceivable fundamental laws universe contained special case human lips shaping phrase 'Wingardium Leviosa'. And yet even fumbling grasp magic enough things Muggle physics said impossible: Time-Turner, water conjured nothingness Aguamenti. What ultimate possibilities invention, underlying laws universe permitted eleven-year-old stick violate almost every constraint Muggle version physics?  Like hunter-gatherer trying look Sun, guess universe shaped way allowed nuclear energy...  It made wonder maybe twenty thousand million million million meters much distance, all.  There step beyond Abstract Reasoning Harry could take, given time enough compose right surroundings. Looking stars, could try imagine distant descendants humanity would think dilemma - hundred million years, visible stars would rotated great galactic movements entirely new positions, every constellation scattered. It elementary theorem probability already knew answer would updating future evidence, ought adopt answer right now. If knew destination, already there. And analogy, quite theorem, could guess descendants humanity would think something, ought go ahead take best guess.  From vantage point idea killing two-thirds Wizengamot seemed lot less appealing hours earlier. Even it, even knew solid fact would best thing magical Britain complete Story Time would look worse it... even necessity, deaths sentient beings would still tragedy. One element sorrows Earth; Most Ancient Earth everything begun, long ago far away, ever long ago.  He like Grindelwald. There nothing human left him. Him must destroy. Save fury that, alone -  Harry shook head slightly, tilting stars little vision, lay stone floor looking upward outward forward time. Even Dumbledore right, true enemy utterly mad evil... hundred million years organic lifeform known Lord Voldemort probably seem much different bewildered children Ancient Earth. Whatever Lord Voldemort done himself, whatever Dark rituals seemed horribly irrevocable merely human scale, beyond curing technology hundred million years. Killing him, it, would one death future sentient beings sad about. How could look stars, believe anything else?  Harry stared twinkling lights Eternity wondered children's children's children would think Dumbledore maybe-done Narcissa.  But even tried framing question way, asking humanity's descendants would think, still drew knowledge, theirs. The answer still came inside yourself, could still mistaken. If know tenth decimal digit pi yourself, know children's children's children would calculate it, fact trivial.  Thoughts came Harry's mind, then, elements vast stored wisdom thousand lives lay within parents' science fiction collection. There might reasons Harry sometimes seemed older physical age, fictional lives he'd lived probably also played role. Harry might able remember exact words, like Hermione could, remembered sense.  In mirrors many judgments, hands color blood. I sometimes fancy evil exists oppose evils; great Day prophets speak truly believe, day world utterly cleansed evil, I go darkness, swallowing curses. Until then, I wash hands let hang useless.  Corwin Amber.  There always cannot saved.   If I must sacrifice five hundred save one thousand -   Then I abandon one hundred earn nine hundred.   But still -   I believed someone would superhero saved everyone even though thought like that.   It might idealistic concept impossible pipe dream, superhero someone tries save everyone spite that.  Emiya Shirou.  No words prevent killing. Words iron bands. But I taught hesitate, stay hands weight duty crushed down.  Anansi Spider.  Harry took breath cold night air, said, quietly night, "All right."  Slowly - he'd probably lying there, looking stars, longer he'd thought - Harry sat ground. Pushing feet, muscles protesting, walked edge stone platform height Ravenclaw tower. The stone crenellations surrounding edge tower high, anywhere near high enough safe; marker, clearly, railing. Harry approach close edge; point taking chances. Looking Hogwarts grounds below, predictably feeling sense dizziness, wobbly affliction called vertigo. His brain alarmed, course, ground distant. It might fully 50 meters away.  I make bargain myself, Harry said within himself, parts. I follow path superhero far I can. But I can't - anyone dies, Important Character like Hermione Professor McGonagall single nameless innocent bystander catches Cutting Curse - gloves come villains die fast possible; I pretend real people real life go war without sacrificing anyone...  ...if I fail.  I'll try hard I save everyone, I fail, I'll admit work, change policies. Does satisfy us?  It didn't, really; satisfy part him; Slytherin afraid would lose war trying act like superhero even once, Gryffindor wanted one try.  But Harry's parts understood compromises made, best compromise collectively likely get; besides, end, Harry final word.  Turning resolutely upon heel, boy strode back toward gap rooftop stairway leading Ravenclaw tower. In end...  ...in end, still homework due tomorrow.   Final Aftermath:  She came awake gasp horror, woke unvoiced scream lips words came forth, could understand seen, could understand seen -  "What time it?" whispered.  Her golden jeweled alarm clock whispered back, "Around eleven night. Go back sleep."  Her sheets soaked sweat, nightclothes soaked sweat, took wand beside pillow cleaned tried go back sleep eventually succeeded.  Sybill Trelawney went back sleep.  In Forbidden Forest, centaur woken nameless apprehension ceased scanning night sky, found questions answers; folding many legs, Firenze went back sleep.  In distant lands magical Asia, ancient witch named Fan Tong, sleeping tired days away, told anxious great-great-grandson fine, nightmare, went back sleep.  In land Muggleborns received letters kind, girl-child young name rocked arms annoyed loving mother stopped crying went back sleep.  None slept well.
