slytherins interviewed several eyewitnesses came conclusion harry potter would dangerous student jolt adrenaline poured harry system making stand straighter know conclusion professor quirrell come good ah professor quirrell harry started say professor quirrell looked amused thinking come wrong answer mr potter learn expect better professor quirrell straightened leaned desk mr potter things accustomed uses give ten unaccustomed uses objects room combat moment harry rendered speechless sheer raw shock understood ideas started pour desks heavy enough fatal dropped great height chairs metal

everything got pockets mokeskin pouch talk time turner invisibility cloak something could say red spheres enough mr potter well think understand makes mr potter dangerous student classroom low murmur assent say loud please terry boot makes dorm mate dangerous ah um creative wrong bellowed professor quirrell fist came sharply desk amplified sound made everyone jump mr potter ideas worse useless harry started surprise remove floor create spike trap ridiculous combat sort preparation time would hundred better uses transfigure material walls mr potter cannot perform transfiguration mr potter exactly one idea could use immediately right without extensive preparation cooperative enemy magic know idea jam wand enemy eye socket would likely break wand kill opponent short mr potter afraid proposals uniformly awful harry said indignantly asked unusual ideas practical ones thinking outside box would use something classroom kill someone professor quirrell expression disapproving smile crinkles around eyes mr potter never said kill time place taking enemy alive inside hogwarts classroom usually one places answer question hit neck edge chair laughter slytherins laughing harry everyone else looking rather horrified mr potter demonstrated dangerous student classroom asked unaccustomed uses items room combat mr potter could suggested using desk block curse using chair trip oncoming enemy wrapping cloth around arm create improvised shield instead every single use mr potter named offensive rather defensive either fatal potentially fatal wait true harry sudden sense vertigo tried remember exactly suggested surely counterexample professor quirrell said mr potter ideas strange useless reach far impractical order meet standard killing enemy idea fell short worth considering reflects quality might call intent kill harry potter could stare five older slytherins draco malfoy not yet mr malfoy would hardly shrink talk ordinary murder even shocked yes mr malfoy watching face mr potter described use classmates bodies raw material censors inside mind make flinch away thoughts like mr potter thinks purely killing enemy grasp means flinch censors even though youthful genius undisciplined impractical useless intent kill makes harry potter dangerous student classroom one final point let us make point ravenclaw indispensable requisite true fighting wizard harry mouth gaped open speechless shock searched frantically something say completely could see students starting believe harry mind flipping possible denials finding anything could stand

quirrell harry said path becoming dark lord professor quirrell looked harry mr potter said solemnly slight grin word advice thing performance perfect real people beaten humiliated fifteen minutes stand graciously forgive enemies sort thing trying convince everyone dark believe every possible observation confirm theory trifle much indignation earth to convince convince harbor ambitions becoming dark lord said professor quirrell looking outright amused suppose could raise right hand harry said blankly raise right hand whether harry stopped feeling rather stupid indeed said professor quirrell easily either way nothing convince would know exactly trying to even precise suppose barely possible perfectly good people exist even though never met one nonetheless improbable someone would beaten fifteen minutes stand feel great surge kindly forgiveness attackers hand less improbable young child would imagine role play order convince teacher classmates next dark lord import act lies act

convince abandon ambition sorted slytherin sorted ravenclaw mr potter said professor quirrell much usual looking dry smile know accustomed everyone around fool please mistake one likelihood sorting hat would play first prank eight hundred years upon head small worth considering suppose barely possible snapped fingers invented simple clever way defeat anti tampering spells upon hat though think method far probable explanation dumbledore decided happy hat choice boy lived evident anyone tiniest smidgin common sense secret safe hogwarts harry opened mouth closed feeling complete helplessness professor quirrell wrong wrong convincing way harry starting think simply rational judgment given evidence available professor quirrell times never predictable times still sometimes would get

obvious theorem moral system hard describe actual proof steps um people would get hurt surely wanted hurt people said professor quirrell wanted hurt bullies today dark lord means people want hurt get hurt harry floundered words decided simply go obvious first want hurt someone mean right makes something right wanting ah harry said preference utilitarianism pardon said professor quirrell ethical theory good satisfies preferences people professor quirrell said fingers rubbed bridge nose think quite trying say mr potter end people want sometimes people give names like right things want could

said moments wiping sweat forehead sorry draco got lot political power makes sense keep calculating slytherin thinks important game insulted ask lower level game ravenclaw look bad associating tell slytherin gritting teeth pretend friend exactly draco told slytherin still sure whether true anyway draco said speaking image afraid got bad news rita skeeter heard stories asking questions harry potter raised eyebrows writes daily prophet draco said tried keep worry voice daily prophet one father primary tools used like wizard wand newspaper people actually pay attention rita skeeter writes celebrities puts uses quill puncture inflated reputations find rumors make see said harry potter green lit face looked thoughtful beneath cowl draco hesitated saying say next someone certainly reported father courting harry potter father would also know draco written home father would understand draco think could actually keep secret sent clear message draco practicing game still father side since draco tempted away would sending false reports followed father probably anticipated draco say next playing game father real rather unnerving sensation even side one hand exhiliarating draco also knew end would turn father played game better way could possibly go harry draco finally said suggestion advice way father could almost certainly quash article would cost father expecting draco tell harry potter exactly something draco said loud harry potter would work instead harry potter shook head smiling beneath cowl intention trying quash rita skeeter draco even try keep incredulity voice tell care newspaper says care less might think said harry potter ways dealing likes skeeter need lucius help worried look came draco face could stop whatever harry potter next would something father expecting draco feeling nervous might lead draco also realized hair getting sweaty underneath cowl never actually worn one realized death eaters cloaks probably things like cooling charms harry potter wiped sweat forehead grimaced took wand pointed upward took deep breath said frigideiro moments later draco felt cold draft frigideiro frigideiro frigideiro frigideiro frigideiro harry potter lowered wand though hand seemed bit shaky put back robes whole room seemed perceptibly cooler draco could done still bad draco said science going tell blood going find blood harry potter said experiments right draco said sort experiments harry potter smiled evilly beneath cowl said tell draco heard something called socratic method teaching asking questions named ancient philosopher smart real muggle hence disguised pureblood wizard one tutors used socratic teaching lot annoying effective potter method insane fair draco admit harry potter tried socratic method first working well harry potter asked draco would go disproving blood purist hypothesis wizards neat stuff done eight centuries ago interbred muggleborns squibs draco said understand harry potter could sit straight face claim trap harry potter replied still straight face trap would pathetically obvious ought ground fed pet snakes trap simply rule scientists operated try disprove theories made honest effort failed victory draco tried point staggering stupidity suggesting key surviving duel cast avada kedavra foot miss harry potter nodded draco shaken head harry potter presented idea scientists watched ideas fight see ones fight without opponent draco needed figure opponents blood purist hypothesis fight blood purism could win draco understood little better even though harry potter said rather distasteful look like clear blood purism way world really sky blue theory true sky green nobody seen sky yet went outside looked blood purists happened six times row people would start noticing trend harry potter proceeded claim opponents draco inventing weak blood purism get credit defeating battle impressive enough draco understood wizards gotten weaker house elves stealing magic sounded impressive either though harry potter said one least testable could try check house elves gotten stronger time even draw picture representing increasing strength house elves another picture representing decreasing strength wizards two pictures matched would point house elves said completely serious tones draco felt impulse ask dobby pointed questions veritaserum snapping harry potter finally said draco fix battle scientists dumb would obvious fixed battle real fight two different theories might really true test true hypothesis would win something actually would come different ways depending hypothesis actually correct would experienced scientists watching make sure exactly happened harry potter claimed wanted know blood really worked need see blood purism really win draco going fool theories knocked even seen point draco able invent plausible alternatives harry potter put idea wizards getting less powerful mixing blood mud obviously true harry potter said rather frustrated imagine draco really bad considering different viewpoints surely death eaters posed enemies blood purism come much plausible sounding arguments side draco offering draco trying pose member dumbledore faction come house elf hypothesis fooled anyone second draco forced admit point hence potter method please dr malfoy whined harry potter accept paper harry potter needed repeat phrase pretend pretending scientist three times draco understood moment draco realized something deeply wrong harry potter brain anyone tried legilimency would probably never come back harry potter gone considerable detail draco pretend death eater posing editor scientific journal dr malfoy wanted reject enemy dr potter paper heritability magical ability death eater act like real scientist would would revealed death eater executed dr malfoy also watched rivals needed appear reject dr potter paper neutral scientific reasons would lose position journal editor wonder sorting hat gibbering madly st mungo also complicated thing anyone ever asked draco pretend possible way could refused challenge right harry potter put getting mood afraid dr potter wrote wrong color ink draco said next dr potter face excellent job crumpling despair draco help feel flash dr malfoy glee even though death eater pretending dr malfoy part fun could done day long dr potter got chair slumped dismay trudged turned harry potter gave draco thumbs turned back dr potter approaching eager smile dr potter sat presented dr malfoy piece parchment written heritability magical ability dr h j potter evans verres institute sufficiently advanced science observation today wizards things impressive wizards used 800 years ago conclusion wizardkind become weaker mixing blood muggleborns squibs dr malfoy said dr potter hopeful look wondering journal irreproducible results could consider publication paper entitled heritability magical ability draco looked parchment smiling considered possible rejections professor would refused essay short long dr potter said dr malfoy moment genuine incredulity dr potter face ah said dr potter get rid separate lines observations conclusions put therefore short next dr potter trudged right said harry potter getting good two times practice third time real interruptions come straight time reject paper based actual content remember scientific rivals watching dr potter next paper perfect every way marvel kind unfortunately rejected dr malfoy journal trouble letter e dr potter offered rewrite without words dr malfoy explained really vowel problem paper rejected tuesday fact saturday dr potter tried point told next draco starting understand snape used hold dumbledore get position let awful students dr potter approaching superior smirk face latest paper heritability magical ability dr potter stated confidently thrust parchment decided allow journal publish prepared perfect accordance guidelines may publish quickly death eater decided track kill dr potter mission done dr malfoy kept polite smile face since rivals watching said pause stretched dr potter looking impatiently let look please dr malfoy took parchment perused carefully death eater starting get nervous fact real scientist draco trying remember talk like harry potter ah need consider possible explanations um observation besides one really interrupted dr potter like exactly house elves stealing magic data admit one possible conclusion dr malfoy plausible hypotheses draco trying furiously order brain think would say posing member dumbledore faction claim explanation wizardkind decline draco never bothered actually ask think way explain data publish paper dr malfoy sneer dr potter face oh yeah snapped dr malfoy know magic fading away time stopped draco harry potter exchanged looks appalled horror harry potter spat something probably extremely bad word raised muggles think said harry potter magic goes away damn damn damn alarm harry potter voice contagious without even thinking draco hand went robes clutched wand thought house malfoy safe long married families could trace bloodlines back four generations supposed safe never occurred might nothing anyone could stop end magic harry do draco voice rising panic do let think moments harry grabbed nearby desk quill roll parchment used write pretend paper started scribbling something figure harry said voice tight magic fading world figure fast fading much time left something figure fading something draco wizarding powers declining steady rate sudden drops i know told one matched four founders hogwarts going least eight centuries remember hearing anything problems suddenly appearing five centuries ago anything like draco trying frantically think always heard nobody good merlin nobody good founders hogwarts right harry said still scribbling three centuries ago muggles started believe magic thought might something century half ago muggles began using kind technology stops working around magic wondering might also go way around draco exploded chair angry could hardly even speak muggles damn roared harry even listening going eight centuries least muggles anything interesting figure real truth muggles might something go blaming everything stops us figuring really going one day going wake morning find wand stick wood draco breath stopped throat father often said wands break hands speeches draco never really thought meant going happen suddenly seemed real stick wood draco could imagine would like take wand try cast spell find nothing happening could happen everyone would wizards magic ever muggles legends ancestors able muggles would called malfoy would left name first time life draco realized death eaters always taken granted becoming death eater something grew draco understood knew father father friends sworn give lives prevent nightmare coming pass things stand watch happen going happen anyway sacrifices friends lost dumbledore family lost nothing magic fading away draco said voice breaking fair harry stopped scribbling looked face angry expression father never told life fair father said every single time draco used word but awful believe draco let introduce something call litany tarski changes every time use occasion runs like magic fading world want believe magic fading world magic fading world want believe magic fading world let become attached beliefs may want living world magic fading believe know coming stop worst case prepared time left believing stop happening question ask whether magic actually fading world live want believe litany gendlin true already owning make worse got draco going make memorize later something repeat time start wondering good idea believe something actually true fact want say right true already owning make worse say true already repeated draco voice trembling owning make worse magic fading want believe magic fading magic fading want believe magic fading say draco repeated back words sickness churning stomach good harry said remember might happening believe either first want know actually going world actually live harry turned back work scribbled turned parchment draco could see draco leaned desk harry brought green light closer observation wizardry powerful hogwarts founded hypotheses 1 magic fading 2 wizards interbreeding muggles squibs 3 knowledge cast powerful spells lost 4 wizards eating wrong foods children something else besides blood making grow weaker 5 muggle technology interfering magic since 800 years ago 6 stronger wizards fewer children draco child check 3 powerful wizards quirrell dumbledore dark lord children tests right harry said breathing sounded little calmer dealing confusing problem idea going smart thing figure really simple tests things look right away need fast tests distinguish hypotheses observations would come different way least one compared ones draco stared list shock suddenly realizing knew awful lot purebloods children vincent gregory practically everyone two powerful wizards everyone talked dumbledore dark lord neither children like harry suspected going really hard distinguish 2 6 harry said blood either way try track decline wizardry compare many kids different wizards measure abilities muggleborns compared purebloods harry fingers tapping nervously desk let lump 6 2 call blood hypothesis 4 unlikely everyone would notice sudden drop wizards switched new foods hard see would changed steadily 800 years 5 unlikely reason sudden drop muggles anything 800 years back 4 looks like 2 5 looks like 1 anyway mainly trying distinguish 1 2 3 harry turned parchment drew ellipse around three numbers turned back magic fading blood weakening knowledge disappearing test comes differently depending true could see would mean one false know blurted draco asking scientist draco harry said note pleading desperation voice know muggle scientists know grew wizarding world know magic know magic thought whole idea first place start thinking like scientist solve draco swallowed hard stared paper magic fading wizards interbreeding muggles knowledge lost world look like magic fading said harry potter know magic one guessing imagine telling story happens story draco imagined charms used work stop working wizards wake find wands sticks wood world look like wizarding blood gets weaker people things ancestors could world look like knowledge lost people know cast charms first place said draco stopped surprised test harry nodded decisively one wrote parchment tests spells know cast 1 2 lost spells longer known 3 distinguishes 1 2 one hand 3 hand said harry need way distinguish 1 2 magic fading blood weakening could tell difference kind charms students used cast first year hogwarts said draco used able cast much powerful charms blood stronger harry potter shook head magic stronger figure way telling difference harry stood chair began pacing nervously classroom wait might still work suppose different spells use different amounts magical energy ambient magic weakened powerful spells would die first spells everyone learns first year would stay harry nervous pacing sped good test powerful wizardry lost versus wizardry lost someone blood could weak powerful wizardry strong enough easy spells draco know powerful wizards within single era like powerful wizards century powerful children dark lord cast cooling charm eleven could frozen whole room draco face screwed tried recollect remember hearing anything dark lord think dumbledore supposed done something amazing transfiguration w l fifth year think powerful wizards good hogwarts harry scowled still pacing could studying hard still first year students learned spells seemed powerful could call weak evidence favoring 1 2 wait hold harry stopped stood another test might distinguish 1 2 would take explain uses things scientists know blood inheritance easy question ask combine test test come way strong hint answer harry almost ran back desk took parchment wrote b ancient first year students cast sort spells power weak evidence 1 2 blood could also losing powerful wizardry c additional test distinguishes 1 2 using scientific knowledge blood explain later okay said harry least try tell difference 1 2 3 let go right away figure tests ones already going look little odd draco malfoy harry potter go around asking questions together idea go hogwarts find old portraits ask spells learned cast first years portraits know anything odd draco malfoy ask recent portraits living people spells know cast one notice anything unusual harry potter asks weird questions complicated research forgotten spells want

pomfrey said permanent harry said quietly said mostly recover time classes start tomorrow single instant news came relief draco realized went madam pomfrey whispered draco course said harry potter though stating obvious hand working slowly dawning draco absolute fool far worse older slytherins chewed taken granted one would go authorities malfoy something one would want lucius malfoy eye ever harry potter frightened little hufflepuff trying stay game already playing father eye already else madam pomfrey say said draco heart throat professor flitwick said spell cast hand dark torture hex extremely serious business refusing say absolutely unacceptable long pause draco said shaking voice harry potter smiled slightly apologized deeply made professor flitwick look stern told professor flitwick whole thing indeed extremely serious secret delicate business already informed headmaster project draco gasped flitwick going accept check dumbledore indeed said harry potter promptly hauled headmaster office draco trembling dumbledore brought harry potter wizengamot willingly otherwise boy lived testify veritaserum draco tortured many people loved harry potter father could lose vote father might able convince dumbledore would cost cost terribly game rules threaten someone random draco walked dumbledore hands free draco valuable hostage though since draco death eater valuable father thought thought tore heart like cutting charm whispered draco dumbledore deduced immediately knew associating worst possible scenario dumbledore guessed might risked using legilimency find dumbledore knew draco forced word little chat harry potter grinned explained would best interest anything draco mind ran brick wall splattered stared harry potter mouth hanging slack like fool took long draco remember harry knew dumbledore mysterious secret one snape used hold draco could see dumbledore looking stern concealing eagerness explained harry terribly serious matter harry politely telling dumbledore keep mouth shut knew good father warned draco people like people could ruin still likable hard hate properly harry said headmaster told professor flitwick indeed secret delicate

strange thought came draco something harry kept talking yesterday thought test awakened scientist harry said even never learn use power always looking ways test beliefs ominous words spoken gasps agony kept running draco mind harry pretending repentant friend accidentally hurt someone planned draco said managing put note accusation voice got angry wanted fool harry potter would say course planned mine harry turned back toward draco happened yesterday plan harry said voice seeming stuck throat plan would teach always better knowing truth would try together discover truth blood whatever answer would accept yesterday rushed things always better knowing truth draco said coldly like favor harry nodded blowing draco mind completely said lucius comes idea problem stronger wizards fewer children might start program pay strongest purebloods children fact blood purism right lucius addressing problem side make things happen right away right draco friend lucius would try stop wasting effort one knows real truth predict real results thought came draco harry potter raised place strange effectively magical creature rather wizard draco simply guess harry would say next draco said putting pain betrayal voice hard plan well harry said lucius heir believe dumbledore thinks belong could grow fight battles could something else slowly draco mind wrapped around want provoke fight finish seize power exhausted draco felt cold dread chest would try stop matter cost harry shook head stars no go along neither would said harry world want break imagine say lucius thought conspiracy tool side dumbledore thought conspiracy tool side lucius thought turned dumbledore believed conspiracy mine dumbledore thought turned lucius believed conspiracy helped us ways one notice draco fake speechless father taken see play called tragedy light incredibly clever slytherin named light set purify world evil using ancient ring could kill anyone whose name face knew opposed another incredibly clever slytherin villain named lawliet worn disguise conceal true face draco shouted cheered right parts especially middle play ended sadly draco hugely disappointed father gently pointed word tragedy right title afterward father asked draco understood gone see play draco said teach cunning light lawliet grew father said draco possibly wrong pointed lawliet cleverly concealed face good reason tell light name father gone demolish almost every part play draco listened eyes growing wider wider father finished saying plays like always unrealistic playwright known someone actually smart light would actually playwright would tried take world instead writing plays father told draco rule three plot required three different things happen would never work real life father explained since fool would attempt plot complicated possible real limit two draco even find words describe sheer gargantuan unworkability harry master plan sort mistake would make mentors thought clever learned plotting watching plays said harry think plan clever draco said slowly shouting brilliant gasping awe would looked suspicious harry ask question sure said harry buy granger expensive pouch show hard feelings said harry though expect also feel awkward refuses small requests make next couple months draco realized harry actually trying friend harry move granger smart maybe even brilliant make enemy suspect put debt friendly way could maneuver position asking draco gotten away target would suspicious boy lived could first step harry plot give enemy expensive present draco thought could work harry enemy plots might hard see first might even stupid reasoning would make sense understood would comprehend trying hurt way harry acting toward draco right make sense harry friend tried friends alien incomprehensible way raised muggles even meant destroying entire life silence stretched know abused friendship terribly harry said finally please realize draco end wanted two us find truth together something forgive fork two paths one path easy go back later draco changed mind guess understand trying draco lied yes harry eyes lit glad hear draco said softly two students stood alcove harry still dipped lone sunbeam draco shadow draco realized note horror despair although terrifying fate indeed harry friend harry many different avenues threatening draco enemy would even worse probably maybe well could always switch enemies later doomed draco said study next saturday better go like last one worry said harry saturdays like ahead harry laughed draco oh go harry said grinned sheepishly know bad time wanted ask advice something actually okay draco said still bit distracted last statement harry eyes grew intent buying pouch granger used gold managed steal gringotts vault mcgonagall vault key dumbledore maybe launch plot might take money wondering know get access loan money said draco mouth sheer existential reflex harry looked taken aback pleased way draco much harry named amount draco quite keep shock showing face almost spending money father given draco last whole year draco would left galleons draco mentally kicked write father explain money gone managed loan harry potter father would send special congratulatory note written golden ink giant chocolate frog would take two weeks eat ten times many galleons case harry potter needed another loan way much said harry sorry asked excuse malfoy know said draco surprised wanted much worry harry potter said cheerfully nothing threatens family interests evil draco nodded problem want go get right sure said harry left alcove started heading toward dungeons draco help ask tell plot rita skeeter draco thought bad words far late say time reached dungeons draco started pulling together thoughts trouble hating harry potter harry trying friendly insane going stop draco revenge even slow draco said looking around make certain one nearby voices would blurred course never hurt extra sure thinking bring new recruits conspiracy going to think equals otherwise would take one blow plot father already worked right naturally said harry equals said draco afraid harry said clear trying sound gentle also clear trying suppress good deal condescension quite succeeding sorry draco even know word bayesian bayesian conspiracy means right going to study months take anyone else put good front know enough science draco said carefully keeping voice neutral harry shook head problem ignorant specific science things like deoxyribose nucleic acid stop equal problem trained methods rationality deeper secret knowledge behind discoveries got made first place try teach lot harder learn think yesterday draco yes work one control answered questions asked helped push steering without methods rationality draco possibly steer conspiracy needs go see said draco voice sounding disappointed harry voice tried gentle even try respect expertise draco things like people stuff need respect expertise way could equal comes steering conspiracy scientist one day know one secret deoxyribose nucleic acid trained methods rationality understand said draco people stuff harry said seizing control conspiracy probably even difficult afterward would kill harry potter sure memory rose draco sick inside felt last night knowing harry screaming draco thought bad words fine kill harry harry raised muggles fault insane instead harry would live draco could tell harry good really ought grateful sudden twitch surprised pleasure draco realized actually harry good harry tried carry plan playing dumbledore father fools would die made perfect draco would take harry dreams away harry done draco would tell harry good would absolutely true draco would wield conspiracy power science purify wizarding world father would proud death eater harry potter evil plots would foiled forces right would prevail perfect revenge unless pretend pretending scientist harry told draco words describe exactly wrong harry mind since draco never heard term depth recursion could guess sort plots implied unless exactly harry wanted draco part even larger plot draco would play right trying foil one harry might even know plan unworkable might purpose except luring draco thwart way lay madness limit dark lord twisty sort thing happen real life father silly bedtime stories foolish gargoyles always ended furthering hero plans every time tried stop beside draco harry walked along smile face thinking evolutionary origins human intelligence beginning people quite understood evolution worked gone around thinking crazy ideas like human

sorry count said lee jordan giant spider type boy lived said important work order chaos something serious secret significant difficult usual run pranks harry potter launched speech inspiring yet vague speech effect fred george lee tremendous potential could learn weirder make people lives surreal instead surprising equivalents buckets water propped doors fred george exchanged interested looks never thought one harry potter invoked picture prank pulled neville harry mentioned remorse sorting hat chewed must made neville doubt sanity neville would felt like suddenly transported alternate universe way everyone else felt seen snape apologize true power pranking harry potter cried lee jordan answered count us said fred possibly george doubt godric gryffindor would said yes lee jordan gave regretful grin stood left deserted quieted corridor four members order chaos met sat conspiratorial circle three members order chaos got business sad fred george would still work lee giant spider pranks ever started calling order chaos order recruit harry potter ron told harry weird evil fred george decided save harry showing true friendship kindness thankfully longer seemed necessary although quite sure said one twins rita skeeter said harry know fred george nodded frowning asking questions good news guess want fred george looked bit puzzled want us slip interesting candies said harry no giant spider thinking come would heard rita skeeter looking rumors made obvious grins slowly started faces fred george start rumors replied exactly said harry grinning widely rumors want teach people never believe newspaper says harry potter muggles believe newspaper says elvis first thought flooding rita skeeter many rumors know believe cherry pick ones sound plausible bad want create fake story get rita skeeter believe somehow something afterward everyone know fake want fool rita skeeter editors afterward proof come false course given requirements story ridiculous possibly still get printed understand want exactly fred george said slowly want us invent story want harry potter said sort busy right plus want able say truthfully idea coming surprise moment evil grin faces fred george turned serious harry really know anything like figure harry said confidence total confidence tell try someone else really good idea ridiculous story convince rita skeeter editors print go ahead go something mediocre come something awesome say fred george exchanged worried glances think anything said george neither said fred sorry harry stared harry began explain went thinking things known take longer two seconds said harry never called question impossible said harry taken actual clock thought five minutes motion minute hand five minutes metaphorically five minutes physical clock furthermore harry said voice emphatic right hand thumping hard floor start immediately looking solutions harry launched explanation test done someone named norman maier something called organizational psychologist asked two different sets problem solving groups tackle problem problem harry said involved three employees three jobs junior employee wanted easiest job senior employee wanted rotate jobs avoid boredom efficiency expert recommended giving junior person easiest job senior person hardest job would 20 productive one set problem solving groups given instruction propose solutions problem discussed thoroughly possible without suggesting set problem solving groups given instructions people done natural thing reacted presence problem proposing solutions people gotten attached solutions started fighting arguing relative importance freedom versus efficiency first set problem solving groups ones given instructions discuss problem first solve far likely hit upon solution letting junior employee keep easiest job rotating two people two jobs expert data said would 19 improvement starting looking solutions taking things entirely order like starting meal dessert bad harry also quoted someone named robyn dawes saying harder problem likely people try solve immediately harry going leave problem fred george would discuss aspects brainstorm anything thought might remotely relevant try come actual solution finished unless course happen randomly think something awesome case could write afterward go back thinking want hear back called failures think anything least week people spent decades trying think things questions said harry fred george stared think neither harry coughed gently ask budget budget thought could tell amount harry said think inspiring harry hands dipped robe brought forth fred george almost fell even though sitting spend sake spending harry said stone floor front gleamed absolutely ridiculous amount money spend awesomeness requires awesomeness require hesitate spend anything left return afterward trust oh get ten percent regardless much end spending blurted one twins accept money sort thing twins never took money anything illegal unknown ambrosius flume selling merchandise zero percent markup fred george wanted able testify veritaserum necessary profiteering criminals providing public service harry frowned asking put real work grownup would get paid something like would still count favor friend hire people sort thing fred george shook heads fine harry said get expensive christmas presents try returning burn even know much going spend except obviously going taken money going buy presents anyway think tell think anything awesome harry stood smiling turned go fred george still gaping shock strode steps away turned back oh one last thing harry said leave professor quirrell whatever like publicity know easier get people believe weird things defense professor anyone else sorry to get way like please leave professor quirrell harry turned took steps looked back one last time said softly thank left long pause departed said one said defense professor like publicity harry know us well use money course course right defense professor separately get gryffindors write skeeter say sleeve lifted one time defense class saw dark mark probably teaching harry potter sorts dreadful things worst defense professor anyone remembers even hogwarts failing teach us getting everything wrong complete opposite like claimed could cast killing curse using love made pretty much useless like one thanks bet defense professor likes sense humor called us sense humor really going able harry job harry said discuss problem trying solve let weasley twins decided george would enthusiastic one fred doubted seems sort contradictory said fred wants ridiculous enough everyone laughs skeeter knows wrong wants skeeter believe things time fake evidence convince skeeter said george solution said fred considered maybe said george think strict twins shrugged helplessly fake evidence good enough convince skeeter said fred really said george pointed pile money hire people help us twins got thoughtful look face could use harry budget pretty fast said fred lot money us lot money someone like flume maybe people give discounts know harry said george importantly whatever impossible fred blinked mean impossible impossible get trouble one believes could done impossible even harry starts wondering surreal make people doubt sanity better harry fred eyes wide astonishment happened sometimes often pranks pranks pie prank remembrall prank kevin entwhistle cat prank snape prank best pranksters hogwarts going roll give without fight boy lived said fred weasley twins challenging us said could bet think ever good right said fred feeling rather nervous weasley twins sometimes disagree even information every time seemed unnatural like least one must something wrong harry potter talking impossible yes said george impossible said fred godric gryffindor would said george settled twins snapped back whatever was normal right let think chapter 26 noticing confusion yakka foob mog grug pubbawup zink wattoom gazork chumble spuzz j k rowling

ask unimportant question like mr potter friend sixth year gryffindor think important serious harry said could stop terrible mood today particular reason yes serious fool know actually know believe aurors confirmed veritaserum sixth year hogwarts cast high level dark curse without knowing mean harry said mistaken somehow read wrong spell description knew was meant directed enemy knew knew enough cast spell understand anything small brain could walk upright indeed mr potter said professor quirrell pause professor quirrell leaned forward picked silver inkwell desk turning around hands staring though wondering could go torturing inkwell death sixth year slytherin seriously hurt said harry yes sixth year gryffindor raised muggles yes dumbledore refusing expel poor boy know professor quirrell hands whitened inkwell point mr potter stating obvious professor quirrell said harry gravely muggle raised students hogwarts need safety lecture told things ridiculously obvious wizardborn would ever

carefully placed ruined inkwell desk say nicest things mr potter taking lessons flattery perhaps mr malfoy harry kept expression blank realized one second late might well signed confession professor quirrell care expression looked like cared states mind made likely see said professor quirrell mr malfoy useful friend mr potter much teach hope made mistake trusting many confidences knows nothing fear becoming known said harry well done said professor quirrell smiling slightly original business think done preliminary exercises occlumency ready tutor professor quirrell nodded shall conduct gringotts sunday paused looking harry smiled might even make little outing like pleasant thought harry nodded smiling back harry left office heard professor quirrell humming small tune harry glad been able cheer sunday seemed rather large number people whispering hallways least harry potter walked past lot pointed fingers great deal female giggling started breakfast someone asked harry heard news harry quickly interrupted said news written rita skeeter want hear wanted read paper developed many students hogwarts got copies daily prophet copies already bought owners passed around sort complicated order nobody really knew one moment harry used quieting charm gone eat breakfast trusting seat mates wave many many questioners best ignore incredulity laughter congratulatory smiles pitying looks fearful glances dropped plates new people came breakfast heard harry feeling rather curious really done spoil artistry hearing secondhand done homework safety trunk next couple hours telling dormmates come get anyone found original newspaper harry still ignorant 10am left hogwarts carriage professor quirrell front right currently slumped zombie mode harry sitting diagonally across far away carriage allowed back left even harry constant feeling doom carriage rattled small path section non forbidden forest made bit hard read especially since material difficult harry suddenly wished reading one childhood science fiction books instead outside wards mr potter said professor quirrell voice front time go professor quirrell carefully disembarked carriage bracing stepped harry side jumped harry wondering exactly get professor quirrell said catch threw bronze knut harry caught without thinking giant intangible hook caught harry abdomen yanked back hard without sense acceleration instant later harry standing middle diagon alley excuse said brain teleported explained harry used happen ancestral environment harry brain complained disoriented harry staggered feet adjusted brick street instead dirt forest corridor traversing straightened still dizzy bustling witches wizards seeming sway slightly cries shopkeepers seeming move around hearing brain tried place

go set something motion mr potter thoroughly explained responsible anything whatsoever happens leaving newsstand harry said pardon anywhere buy copy daily prophet put happy shortly harry delivered bookstore accompanied several quietly spoken ambiguous threats shopkeeper gotten less ambiguous threats judging way cringed eyes kept darting harry entrance bookstore burned harry going stick around middle fire professor quirrell got back meanwhile harry took quick glance around bookstore seemed rather small shoddy four rows bookcases visible nearest shelf harry eyes jumped seemed deal narrow cheaply bound books grim titles like massacre albania fifteenth century first things first harry stepped seller counter pardon said harry one copy daily prophet please five sickles said shopkeeper sorry kid got three left five sickles dropped onto counter harry feeling could bargained couple points point really care shopkeeper eyes widened seemed really notice harry first time true really shut

details yet evidence fred george cleared sister first surely yes course picture ginevra weasley sighing longingly harry could see looking closely photo staged earth harry sitting cheap folding chair rereading newspaper fourth time door whispered softly professor quirrell came back shop apologies merlin name reading would seem said harry awe voice one mr arthur weasley placed imperius curse death eater father killed thus creating debt noble house potter father demanded repaid hand marriage recently born ginevra weasley people actually sort thing around could miss skeeter possibly fool enough

almost par newspaper worry said harry cheerfully fake elsewhere store heard shopkeeper gasp sound stack books falling mr potter professor quirrell said slowly sure quite sure shall go professor quirrell nodded looking rather abstracted harry folded newspaper back followed door reason harry seem hearing street noises walked silence thirty seconds professor quirrell spoke miss skeeter viewed original proceedings restricted wizengamot session yes original proceedings wizengamot yes would trouble really said harry suspicions correct done hogwarts student beyond impossible professor quirrell said flatly mr potter regret say young lady expects marry improbable said harry quote douglas adams impossible often kind integrity merely improbable lacks see point professor quirrell said slowly mr potter may impossible imagine tampering wizengamot proceedings unimaginable grand manager gringotts affix seal office witness false betrothal contract miss skeeter personally verified seal indeed said harry would expect grand manager gringotts get involved much money changing hands seems mr weasley greatly debt demanded additional payment ten thousand galleons ten thousand galleons weasley could buy daughter noble house excuse harry said really ask point people actually sort thing around rarely said professor quirrell frown face suspect since dark lord departed suppose according newspaper father paid choice said harry wanted fulfill conditions prophecy give said professor quirrell newspaper leaped harry hand fast got paper cut harry automatically put finger mouth suck feeling rather shocked turned remonstrate professor quirrell professor quirrell stopped short middle street eyes flickering rapidly back forth invisible force held newspaper suspended harry watched gaping open awe newspaper opened reveal pages two three much long four five like man cast pretense mortality troublingly short time paper neatly folded professor quirrell plucked air tossed harry caught sheer reflex professor quirrell started walking harry automatically trudged said professor quirrell prophecy sound quite right either harry nodded still stunned centaurs could put imperius professor quirrell said frowning seems understandable magic make magic corrupt unthinkable great seal gringotts could twisted another hand unspeakable could impersonated polyjuice likewise bavarian seer enough effort might possible tamper proceedings wizengamot idea done one single plausible hypothesis said harry know done total budget forty galleons professor quirrell stopped short whirled harry expression completely incredulous forty galleons pay competent ward breaker open path home wish burglarize forty thousand galleons might pay team greatest professional criminals world tamper proceedings wizengamot harry shrugged helplessly remember next time want save thirty nine thousand nine hundred sixty galleons finding right contractor say often said professor quirrell impressed likewise said harry incredible hogwarts student afraid say somewhat harry surprise professor quirrell made objection walked direction gringotts building thinking neither sort person would give problem without considering least five

away warmer said write guess happens students wrote metal conducts heat students wrote air moves one said seems impossible real answer students came room teacher turned plate around interesting said professor quirrell sound similar moral strength rationalist ability confused fiction reality said harry equally good explaining outcome zero knowledge students thought could use words like heat conduction explain anything even metal plate cooler side nearer fire notice confused meant confused falsehood truth tell centaurs imperius curse still feeling something quite right notice still confused even hearing explanation hm said professor quirrell walked suppose said harry possible actually swap people alternate universes like rita skeeter temporarily sent somewhere else possible professor quirrell said voice rather dry would still almost huge white front gringotts building professor quirrell said ah course see let guess weasley twins said harry voice going another octave pitch afraid say fair think extremely fair said professor quirrell entered bronze doors time noon harry professor quirrell seated foot head wide long flat table sumptuously appointed private room

tortured public could get arrested people reluctant provision made recognizing parents muggleborns human limited sense harry adoptive parents fall legal category seemed harry effectively orphan eyes wizarding world headmaster hogwarts designees within school system harry guardians graduated harry could breathe without dumbledore permission long headmaster specifically prohibit harry asked could simply tell griphook diversify investments beyond stacks gold coins sitting vault griphook stared blankly asked diversify meant banks seemed make investments banks stored gold coins secure vaults annual fee wizarding world concept stock equity corporations businesses run families personal vaults loans made rich people banks though gringotts would witness contract fee enforce collection much larger fee good rich people let friends borrow money pay back whenever bad rich people charged interest secondary market loans evil rich people charged annual interest rates least 20 harry stood turned away rested head wall harry asked needed headmaster permission could start bank professor quirrell interrupted point saying time lunch swiftly conducted fuming harry bronze doors gringotts

different charms none harry recognized even really suffice said professor quirrell anything truly great import would necessary perform another twenty three checks besides say rita skeeter knew guessed would come possible could room wearing true cloak invisibility could animagus tiny form perhaps tests rule rare possibilities perform would arduous still wonder anyway teach bad habits professor quirrell tapped finger cheek looking abstracted fine harry said understand remember though little disappointed anything truly great import well professor quirrell said leaned back chair smiling broadly wrought quite well today mr potter basic notion sure even delegated execution think hearing much rita skeeter lucius malfoy pleased failure smart flee country instant realizes fooled sinking sensation began dawn harry stomach lucius behind rita skeeter oh realize said professor quirrell harry thought would happen rita skeeter afterward slightest would get fired job course would fired

silly think going discover anything one ever figured really saying give unraveling secrets magic trying less one month harry said trying put note challenge voice honestly feeling fatigue hermione none good ideas ever worked made one discovery worth mentioning mendelian pattern tell hermione without breaking promise draco hermione said young face looking serious adult saying right studying magic wizards already know sort thing graduate hogwarts um harry said hermione hate put way imagine decided hold research later first thing tried graduated transfiguring alzheimer cure worked feel think

shining phoenix dumbledore patronus told bring harry moments patronus reached light shone skylights illuminated great seven pointed alchemical diagram drawn center circular room showing little dusty saddened minerva transfiguration research one dumbledore great enjoyments known pressed time lately pressed harry potter going waste even headmaster time certainly blame harry done proper thing coming to say idea something transfiguration currently believed impossible done exactly told ordered harry quiet discuss anything consulted headmaster finished moving secure location harry started saying specifically thought could bothered look know hard explain harry said sounding little embarrassed adds believe conflicts scientists believe case genuinely expect scientists know wizards minerva would sighed loud dumbledore seemed taking whole thing seriously harry idea stemmed simple ignorance nothing changed half metal ball glass whole ball different form change part change whole meant removing whole form replacing different one would even mean transfigure half metal ball metal ball whole form half ball different form mr potter said professor mcgonagall want impossible illogical change half something change whole indeed said dumbledore harry hero may able things logically impossible minerva would rolled eyes gone numb long time ago supposing possible said dumbledore think reason results would differ way ordinary transfiguration minerva frowned fact concept literally unimaginable presenting difficulty tried take face value transfiguration imposed half metal ball strange things happening interface said minerva different transfiguring object whole form two different parts dumbledore nodded thought well harry theory correct implies want exactly like transfiguration applied part subject rather whole changes yes harry said firmly whole point dumbledore looked minerva think reason whatsoever would dangerous said minerva finished searching memory likewise said headmaster right since ought exactly analogous ordinary transfiguration respects since cannot think reason whatsoever would dangerous think second degree caution suffice minerva surprised object dumbledore far senior transfiguration tried literally thousands new transfigurations without ever choosing degree caution low used transfiguration combat still alive headmaster thought second degree enough enough

figured truly fascinating dumbledore said take wizard would require months study could may ask partially transfigure subjects probably yes course harry said half hour later minerva feeling equally bewildered considerably reassured safety issues aside logically impossible believe enough headmaster minerva said finally suspect partial transfiguration tiring ordinary sort getting less practice said exhausted pale boy voice unsteady yeah got right process extracting harry wards took another minute minerva escorted much comfortable chair dumbledore produced ice cream soda congratulations mr

recognized authority idea irresponsible sorry said harry realize boy looked appropriately frightened minerva felt something inside relax least harry understood foolish must swear miss granger secrecy dumbledore said gravely tell anyone else unless extremely good reason sworn ah harry said minerva wondering thing headmaster thinking far ahead keep something one else believe dumbledore said something completely unexpected may prove critical advantage harry must preserve please trust professor mcgonagall nodded firm face showing nothing inner confusion please mr potter said right harry said slowly finished examining materials dumbledore added may practice partial transfiguration glass steel steel glass miss granger act spotter naturally either suspect symptom form transfiguration

confident done right thing deciding overthrow harry potter could take world draco even imagine would like live rule good evening dragon general said harry potter chill whisper arrived expected surprising considering draco harry agreed meeting time advance also evening draco knew better say anything general potter draco said much dignity could manage know two armies work together either us win professor quirrell wish right yesss hissed harry like boy thought parselmouth must cooperate destroy sunshine fight us one us betrays earlier one could gain advantage later fight sunshine general knows try trick us thinking betrayed and know tempted betray pretend granger trickery granger knows well draco nodded much obvious us want win one else punish either us defect precisely said harry potter face turning serious faced true prisoner dilemma prisoner dilemma according harry teachings ran thus two prisoners locked separate cells evidence prisoner minor evidence enough prison sentence two years apiece prisoner could opt defect betray testify court would take one year prison sentence add two years prisoner could cooperate staying silent prisoners defected testifying would serve three years apiece cooperated stayed silent would serve two years one defected cooperated defector would serve single year cooperator would serve four prisoners make decision without knowing one choice neither would given chance change decision afterward draco observed two prisoners death eaters wizarding war dark lord would killed traitors harry nodded said one way resolve prisoner dilemma fact death eaters would want dark lord exactly reason draco asked harry stop let think continued explained lot father friends agreed serve dark lord often nice fact harry said pretty much reason people governments might better stole someone else like prisoner would individually better defected prisoner dilemma everyone thought like country would fall chaos everyone would worse like would happen prisoners defected people let ruled governments like death eaters let ruled dark lord draco asked harry stop draco always taken granted ambitious wizards put power wanted rule people let ruled scared little hufflepuffs reflection still seemed true harry perspective fascinating even wrong harry continued afterward fear third party punishing possible reason cooperate prisoner dilemma suppose harry said playing game magically produced identical copy draco said two dracos course neither draco would want anything bad happen one mention malfoy would let become known traitor harry nodded said yet another solution prisoner dilemma people might cooperate cared senses honor wanted preserve reputation indeed harry said rather difficult construct true prisoner dilemma real life people usually cared person honor reputation dark lord punishment something besides prison sentences suppose copy someone completely selfish pansy parkinson example used pansy cared happened pansy given pansy cared dark lord pansy worried reputation pansy either sense honor consider obligated prisoner would rational thing pansy cooperate defect people harry said claimed rational thing pansy defect copy harry plus someone named douglas hofstadter thought people wrong harry said pansy defected random seemed like rational reasons pansy would think exactly way two identical copies decide different things pansy choose world pansies cooperated world pansies defected better copies cooperated harry thought rational people defect prisoner dilemma done anything spread kind rationality country conspiracy full rational people would dissolve chaos would tell enemies rationality sounded reasonable time thought occurring draco said draco said rational solution prisoner dilemma cooperate course would want believe draco fooled cooperating harry would say ha ha betrayed laugh afterward fake lessons harry said seriously remind draco say automatically cooperate true prisoner dilemma like one said choose think like choosing like choosing everyone think like choosing people similar enough probably thing reasons also choosing predictions made anyone knows well enough predict accurately never regret rational correct predictions people make remind explain newcomb problem point question ask draco similar enough probably thing whatever making decisions mostly way know well enough predict predict whether cooperate defect predict decided thing predict know predict deciding draco could help think since strain understand half answer obviously yes said draco pause see said harry sounding disappointed oh well guess think way draco thought going work draco harry talked back forth agreed much earlier battlefield would count broken promises real life though draco little angry harry done

realized draco said still staring beautifully radiant snake cast patronus charm draco cast understood important could evil like dumbledore still cast patronus charm long something bright left inside harry potter single thought inside shone like patronus charm complicated think draco harry said seriously everyone fails casting bad person even unhappy anyway cast second try realized done wrong facing dementor first time well life gets little peculiar sometimes patronus came strange keeping secret supposed believe ask professor quirrell believe said harry ask whether harry potter cast corporeal patronus tell told ask know request one else would know oh draco trust professor quirrell still knowing harry might true professor quirrell lie trivial reasons glowing snake turned head back forth though seeking prey coiled circle though rest wonder harry said softly year generation slytherins stopped trying learn patronus charm people started think slytherins started think cunning ambitious cold unhappy salazar knew students even bother showing learn patronus charm wonder would wish never born wonder went wrong slytherin house went wrong shining creature winked turmoil rising draco making impossible sustain charm draco spun harry control raise wand know slytherin house salazar slytherin never sorted house gives right draco finally realized get sorted slytherin draco said afterwards you somehow snapped fingers draco asked father would cleverer get sorted house everyone would trust father smiled said thought draco age way fool sorting hat harry potter came along ever bought one minute harry ravenclaw interesting hypothesis harry said equably know second person hogwarts come theory along lines least second actually said face snape draco said certainty head house fool professor quirrell course said harry though come think severus ask managed stay house whether something sorting hat wanted suppose could say number three oh professor quirrell theory little different though may word repeat draco nodded without even really thinking supposed say professor quirrell thought dumbledore happy hat choice boy lived instant harry said draco knew knew true obvious dumbledore even think fooling well besides every single person hogwarts except snape quirrell harry might even believe draco stumbled back desk something daze sat hard enough hurt slightly sort thing happened around month harry happened yet january time fellow slytherin might might think ravenclaw sat back chair used earlier sitting crosswise looking intently draco draco know whether trying persuade lost slytherin boy actually ravenclaw trying figure whether harry league dumbledore though suddenly seemed less likely harry set whole thing granger really remembered harry weird normal plots harry draco said deliberately antagonize general sunshine work together harry nodded without hesitation though normal thing world nothing ashamed whole thing gloves making us climb walls hogwarts point make granger friendly toward even plotting really long time since beginning nod whyyyyy harry eyebrows lifted moment reaction showed draco shrieking loudly closed classroom hurt ears why harry potter sort thing harry said slytherins able cast patronus charm make sense draco aware losing control voice seem able stop granger patterns harry said face serious grave like quarter children born squib couples wizards simple unmistakable pattern would recognize instantly knew looking even though know even realize clue poison slytherin house something seen muggle world advance prediction draco could written first day school hearing talk king cross station let describe really pathetic sorts people hang around father political rallies pureblood families would never invited dinner malfoy manor bearing mind never met predicting recognizing pattern happening slytherin house harry potter proceeded describe parkinsons montagues boles calmly cutting accuracy draco dared think case legilimens around beyond insult would kill harry ever heard sum harry finished power wealth muggleborns hate muggleborns vanished way say want wake one morning find nothing long say purebloods superior feel superior feel like part master class even though father would never dream inviting dinner even though one galleon vaults even worse owls worst muggleborn hogwarts even cast patronus charm everything muggleborns fault someone besides blame failures makes even weaker slytherin house becoming pathetic root problem hating muggleborns salazar slytherin said mudbloods needed cast weakening blood draco voice risen shout salazar wrong question simple fact know draco hatred poisoning whole house cast patronus charm using thought like could salazar slytherin cast patronus charm harry wiping sweat forehead things changed listen draco three hundred years ago could find great scientists great salazar way would told muggles inferior skin color skin color said draco know skin color instead anything important like blood purity ridiculous something world changed find great scientists still think skin color matter loser people like ones described salazar slytherin made mistake everyone else making grew believing desperate someone hate people better everyone else around exceptionally good ones accepted everyone else thought exceptionally evil sad fact people notice moral issue unless someone else pointing old salazar met godric lost ability change minds hogwarts built hogwarts started sending acceptance letters muggleborns like godric insisted more people began notice muggleborns different big political issue instead something everyone believes without thinking correct answer muggleborns weaker purebloods people end siding salazar believed either people grew closed pureblood environments like people pathetic desperate someone feel superior people love hate doesn sound right draco voice said ears listened wondered come anything better say draco know nothing wrong hermione granger trouble dropping roof hear even though knew taken feather falling potion even though knew safe sort person think wants kill wrong muggleborn even though s young girl would help homework second ever asked harry voice broke sort person wants die father draco felt split two seemed problem dual vision granger mudblood die girl hanging hand rooftop like seeing double seeing double anyone want hermione granger die want hang around sort people people think slytherin clever planning trying achieve greatness hating muggleborns paid morag sickle ask padma gone slytherin know got option morag told padma gave look said pansy parkinson see best students virtues one house students choices go hat thinking anywhere slytherin someone like padma ends ravenclaw think sorting hat tries maintain balance sorting fills ranks slytherin anyone repelled hatred instead padma patil slytherin gets pansy parkinson cunning ambitious sort person mind slytherin turning padmas go ravenclaw pansies go slytherin process accelerates destroying slytherin house draco ring awful truth padma belonged slytherin instead slytherin got pansy father rallied lesser families like parkinsons convenient sources support father realized consequences associating slytherin name draco said even sure do want sure heal slytherin house harry said slowly know something end took centuries science dawn muggle world happened slowly stronger science got sort hatred retreated harry voice quiet know exactly worked way happened historically though something science like shine patronus charm driving back sorts darkness madness right away seems follow wherever science goes enlightenment was called muggle world something seeking truth think able change mind grew believing thinking logically realizing reason hate someone skin different color like reason hate hermione granger maybe something even understand enlightenment something belong us fixing slytherin house one things let think draco said voice coming something croak please rested head hands thought draco thought palms eyes shut world sound harry breathing persuasive reasonableness harry said evident grains truth contained obvious perfectly entirely obvious hypothesis really going time draco finally raised head sounds right draco said quietly huge smile broke harry face draco continued bring dumbledore make official kept voice casual said oh yeah harry said thing going ask actually draco blood froze veins froze solid shattered professor quirrell said something got thinking well matter answer question already stupid asked lot earlier everyone gryffindor thinks dumbledore saint hufflepuffs think crazy ravenclaws proud worked pretending crazy never asked anyone slytherin supposed know better make sort mistake even think dumbledore okay conspire fixing slytherin house guess miss anything important know draco said voice remarkably calm things considered every time wonder things like annoy tell accidental one could possibly sort thing purpose even tried blood trickled ears reason going strangle huh strangle harry grown muggles dumbledore smoothly diverted slytherin ravenclaw perfectly plausible harry might know anything draco never thought tell else harry guessed draco join dumbledore readily next step dumbledore plan harry really know dumbledore warning take precedence everything right draco said chance organize thoughts know start start somewhere draco drew deep breath going take dumbledore murdered little sister got away brother testify harry listened increasing worry dismay harry prepared thought take blood purist side story grain salt trouble even added enormous amount salt still sound good dumbledore father convicted using unforgivable curses children died azkaban sin dumbledore would matter public record harry could check part see whether made thin air blood purists dumbledore mother died mysteriously shortly younger sister died aurors ruled murder supposedly sister brutalized muggles never spoken draco pointed sounded remarkably like botched obliviation harry first interruptions draco seemed pick general principle presenting observations first inferences afterward take word said draco see right anyone slytherin dumbledore waited fight duel grindelwald exact moment would look best dumbledore grindelwald ruined europe built reputation terrible dark wizard history grindelwald lost gold blood sacrifices getting muggle pawns start heading downhill dumbledore really noble wizard pretended fought grindelwald long dumbledore probably wanted europe ruined probably part plan together attacked grindelwald puppet failed big flashy duel real way two wizards would exactly matched fight twenty whole hours one fell exhaustion dumbledore making look spectacular draco voice became indignant got dumbledore made chief warlock wizengamot line merlin unbroken corrupted fifteen hundred years became supreme mugwump top already hogwarts use invincible fortress headmaster chief warlock supreme mugwump normal person would try anyone see dumbledore trying take world pause harry said closed eyes think worse would heard west stalin russia none would true though blood purists able get away making stuff entirely would daily prophet shown pronounced tendency make stuff stuck neck far weasley betrothal called embarrassed harry opened eyes saw draco watching steady waiting gaze asked time join dumbledore test draco nodded said sounded right sounds right said draco know trust going complain testing mr potter going say fooled led harry knew smile like good sport really much disappointment right fair complain harry said instead must named bad made draco looked bitter think making father side look good dumbledore side look bad believe father told possibility considering harry said evenly draco voice low intense knew father knew friends knew knew dark lord evil chance anyone dumbledore wizard anywhere powerful enough fight death eaters truly evil like bellatrix black father like father friends harry dumbledore taking everything dark lord hope anyone left draco staring hard harry harry met gaze trying think nobody ever thought villain story maybe lord voldemort maybe bellatrix draco certainly death eaters bad guys question question whether bad guys whether one villain story two convinced draco said looked worried little angry surprise harry pretty sure draco believed convinced harry said look away believe strong enough rationalist belief strong evidence unlikely believe true met you strong everything told rethink awakened scientist something grew believing look eyes swear upon honor house malfoy one untruth buried said one thing got added make dumbledore look little worse would noticed draco started open mouth harry said don stain honor house malfoy strong yet know listen draco started notice worrying things nothing definite nothing certain deductions hypotheses untrustworthy witnesses nothing certain story either dumbledore might good reason fight grindelwald years earlier though would pretty good excuse especially considering happening muggle side things still one clearly evil thing dumbledore done certain wonder draco breathing harsh right draco said uneven voice tell dumbledore draco robes came wand draco said quietus quietus got pronunciation wrong second time finally harry took wand said draco hoarsely upon time there girl name narcissa prettiest smartest cunning girl ever sorted slytherin father loved married death eater fighter ever love father draco stopped crying harry felt sick stomach draco never talked mother noticed earlier got way curse draco voice came scream dumbledore burned death bedroom classroom filled soft silver light one boy staring another boy sobbing wiping frantically eyes sleeves robes hard harry stay balanced keep withholding judgment emotional something either wanted start tears eyes sympathy draco know true dumbledore burned death bedroom sound like dumbledore style could think thought many times started wonder trustworthiness whole style concept it must hurt horribly draco said voice shaking father never talks ever talk front mr macnair told scorch marks bedroom mother must struggled dumbledore burned alive debt dumbledore owes house malfoy life draco harry said let hoarseness voice would wrong sound calm sorry sorry asking know know dumble dumbledore said told father warning father testify veritaserum occlumens even get dumbledore put trial father allies believe dumbledore denied everything public know death eaters know father reason lie father would want us take revenge right person see harry draco voice wild unless lucius course found convenient blame dumbledore although also seem like lucius style murdered narcissa would smarter pin blame easier victim instead losing political capital credibility going dumbledore time draco stopped crying looked harry well said draco sounding like wanted spit words evil enough mr potter harry looked arms rested back chair meet draco eyes pain raw expecting hear harry said softly know think know draco voice rose shriek stood abruptly desk remembered dark lord killing parents harry said went front dementor first time remembered worst memory even though long ago heard dying mother begged dark lord kill harry please take kill instead said dark lord mocked laughed remember flash green light harry looked draco could fight harry said could keep fight could tell right mother die wife james killed death eater bad mother die innocent could tell right mother die dumbledore must reason made okay burn alive bedroom bad mother die know draco either way obvious biased rule says wrong kill innocent people rule switch mother switch mother mine tell lily enemy death eaters right kill enemies rule says dumbledore right kill narcissa since enemy harry voice went hoarse two us going agree anything going neither deaths right one mother die fury boiling inside draco great could barely stop storming room halted recognition critical moment small remnant friendship tiny flash sympathy forgotten forgotten harry mother father dead dark lord hand silence stretched talk harry said draco talk get angry thinking know narcissa dying much worse lily dying wrong even make comparison guess stupid draco said time time forgot must hate death eaters killing parents hate death eaters way hate dumbledore harry never said anything never reacted draco talked death eaters kept hidden draco fool harry said s like draco i even know explain except say thought like harry voice choked ever able use cast patronus charm draco felt sudden wrench heart unwanted felt pretending going forget parents saying forget mother enemies harry voice growing equally wild ever done means enemies refuse trapped like justice mean us attack make sense harry stopped took deep breath ran fingers back deliberate mess hair fingers came away sweaty draco could see draco listen expect meet everything right away ask say dark lord wrong kill mother say sad talk whether necessary whether justified ask say sad happened mother life valuable say say sad narcissa died life also worth something expect agree everything right away start saying every life precious sad anyone dies know meet someday want say right wrong sad mother died sad mother died would sad hermione granger died every life precious agree let rest go enough agree draco seems like thought someone could use cast patronus charm tears harry eyes draco getting angry dumbledore killed mother enough say sad understand think malfoys take revenge avenging deaths family went beyond weakness beyond dishonor might well exist arguing harry said quietly say lily potter death sad say one thing draco difficulty finding words know know feel see harry even say lily potter death sad already going death eaters draco got able say death eaters wrong things progress scientist otherwise roadblock way authority contradict every change improvement every improvement change anything better unless manage differently got let better people even father draco even got able point something father say mistaken perfect say better father warned every night went sleep month went hogwarts would people goal trying break loose father trying break part loose said harry trying let fix things father got mistaken trying let better trying break patronus harry voice got softer want break something bright like knows fixing slytherin house might need getting draco thing despite everything getting to really careful around harry arguments sounded convincing even wrong admitting dumbledore told could avenge parents deaths taking lord malfoy son no part wrong harry took deep breath know dumbledore dark lord death eaters parents died three days came hogwarts day first met clothes shop day learned dumbledore even like muggle science says got chance probe thought taking revenge death eaters never crossed mind even know malfoys met clothes shop liked long silence wish could trust draco said voice shaking could know telling truth everything would much simpler suddenly came draco way know whether harry potter really meant everything said wanting fix slytherin house sad mother died would illegal since without father help would dangerous even trust harry potter help right draco said thought definitive experiment want give drop veritaserum draco said one drop lie enough make answer anything know get make certain safe um harry said helpless look face draco um say draco said voice firm calm say experimental result right draco occlumens oh lie trained mr bester professor quirrell set look draco take one drop veritaserum get warning occlumens perfect occlumens mr bester said putting complete block could probably beat veritaserum first year hogwarts crazy know legilimens trust happy demonstrate look draco sorry fact told count something could let know why always like harry mess everything even impossible stop smiling funny sorry sorry know funny took draco get control harry right harry could let draco administer veritaserum really occlumens draco know could ask try legilimency could least ask professor quirrell true could draco trust professor quirrell maybe professor quirrell would say anything harry asked draco remembered thing harry told ask professor quirrell thought different test know said

brighter brighter light ended like shock draco hand went automatically robe bring handkerchief realized crying experimental result harry voice said quietly really mean thought draco slowly turned toward harry lowered wand that got trick right draco said take many shocks patronus really bright yet patronus light knew looking mistake anything else true form patronus charm harry said something lets put strength patronus without hindrance within ask learn dumbledore know secret could cast true form solved puzzle knew understood spell must spoken sake undertook test must speak draco draco know know true strength lay right things double vision double vision draco wanted call harry ideals weakness hufflepuff foolishness sort lie rulers told placate populace harry silly enough believe foolishness taken seriously raised insane heights projected onto stars something beautiful hidden mysterious bright whispered draco able cast patronus like someday always keep seeking truth harry said refuse warm thoughts find sure think person could get anywhere kept going long enough even stars draco wiped eyes handkerchief go back inside draco said unsteady voice someone could seen light harry nodded moved door draco looked night sky one last time followed boy lived already occlumens could cast true form patronus charm strange things harry patronus must stay unseen draco ask questions harry might answered draco take shocks today one shock head going fall right shoulders go bounce bounce bounce corridors hogwarts ducked small alcove instead going way back classroom draco request feeling nervous put longer draco put quieting barrier looked harry silent question thinking harry said five conditions five yes five look draco pledge like begging go terribly wrong somehow know would go wrong play well draco said dumbledore killed mother evil one things talk complicated draco harry said voice careful know say lucius says dumbledore says killed narcissa believe unquestioningly trust lucius dumbledore like said conditions first one point release pledge longer seems like good idea deliberate intended decision part course trick wording something okay said draco sounded safe enough condition two pledging take enemy whoever actually kill narcissa determined honest best ability rationalist whether dumbledore someone else word exercise best ability rationalist keep judgment honest question simple fact agreed like said draco whole point make sure harry never went dumbledore still harry honest catch dumbledore soon enough dishonest already broken word agree condition three narcissa burned alive part story turns something exaggerated make sound little worse get decide whether still go pledge good people sometimes kill ever torture people death narcissa burned alive know whoever evil draco kept temper barely condition four narcissa got hands dirty say crucioed someone child insanity person burned narcissa revenge deal might still wrong burn still killed without pain evil way lucius love never anything like said condition five whoever killed narcissa tricked somehow enemy whoever tricked person tricked really sounds like planning weasel draco take good person enemy anyone really believe wrong thought seems narcissa evil hands fell love lucius chose stay wife whoever burned alive bedroom likely good guy pledge take enemy whoever made happen whether dumbledore anyone else unless deliberately release pledge hopefully go wrong way would play happy said draco okay pledge take mother murderer enemy harry waited patient look face draco tried make voice work help fix problem slytherin house hating muggleborns draco finished whisper say sad lily potter died said harry done break draco knew widened little little lot sensation drifting away lost further shore further home excuse draco said turned away harry tried calm test want fail nervous ashamed draco raised wand starting position patronus charm remembered falling broomstick pain fear imagined coming tall figure cloak looking like dead thing left water draco closed eyes better remember father holding small cold hands warm strength frightened son wand swung broad brandish drive fear away draco surprised strength remembered moment father lost would never lost would always strong person matter happened draco voice cried expecto patronum draco opened eyes shining snake looked back less bright behind heard harry exhale breath though relief draco gazed white light seemed lost completely reminds said harry test hypothesis use patronus send messages going surprise said draco want surprises today harry claimed idea strange see could possibly shock draco way made draco feel even nervous somehow draco could see important way sending messages emergencies trick harry hypothesized wanting spread good news wanting recipient know truth whatever happy thought used cast patronus charm instead telling recipient words patronus message wanting see patronus would go tell harry said draco luminous snake even though harry standing paces away side room um beware green monkey sign play draco seen like king cross station draco wanted harry know father always cared time try say words wanted say happy thought bright snake slithered across room looking like slithering air rather stone got harry traveling short distance said harry strange voice draco recognized probably sounded people beware green monkey hsssss ssss sshsshssss said harry snake slithered back across floor draco harry says message received acknowledged said shining blue krait draco voice huh harry said talking patronuses feels odd looking like said heir slytherin aftermath harry stared draco mean magical snakes right n said draco looking rather pale still stammering least stopped incoherent noises making earlier parselmouth speak parseltongue language snakes everywhere understand snake talks understand talk harry possibly believe sorted ravenclaw heir slytherin snakes sentient chapter 48 utilitarian priorities saturday first morning february ravenclaw table boy bearing breakfast plate heaped high vegetables nervously inspecting servings slightest trace meat might overreaction gotten raw shock harry common sense woken hypothesized parseltongue probably linguistic user interface controlling snakes snakes really human level intelligent someone would noticed smallest brained creatures harry ever heard anything like linguistic ability african grey parrots taught irene pepperberg unstructured protolanguage species played complex games adultery needed model parrots according draco able remember snakes spoke parselmouths sounded like normal human language e full blown recursive syntactical grammar taken time hominids evolve huge brains strong social selection pressures snakes much society harry ever heard thousands upon thousands different species snakes world could use version supposed language parseltongue course merely common sense harry starting lose faith entirely harry sure heard snakes hissing tv point knew sounded like somewhere sounded like language seemed good deal reassuring first problem draco also asserted parselmouths could send snakes extended complex missions true parselmouths make snakes persistently intelligent talking worst case scenario would make snake self aware like harry accidentally done sorting hat harry offered hypothesis draco claimed could remember story harry hoped cthulhu one story fairy tale ring story salazar slytherin sending brave young viper mission gather information snakes snake parselmouth talked could make snakes self aware talking then harry even know mind going then knew perfectly well exponential progression would work sheer moral horror blowing mind someone invented spell like talk cows poultrymouths matter harry froze sudden realization forkful carrots enter mouth couldn possibly true surely wizard would stupid enough harry knew dreadful sinking feeling course would stupid salazar slytherin probably never considered moral implications snake intelligence even one second like ever occurred salazar muggleborns intelligent enough deserve personhood rights people see moral issues unless someone else pointing harry said terry beside sounding like afraid would regret asking staring fork like starting think magic illegal said harry way ever heard stories wizards could speak plants terry heard anything like neither seventh year ravenclaws harry asked harry returned place yet sat staring plate vegetables forlorn expression getting hungrier later day would visiting mary place one incredibly tasty dishes harry finding sorely tempted revert back yesterday eating habits done got eat something said inner slytherin much likely anyone sneezed self awareness onto poultry onto plants long eating

moron manage confer sentience chickens research stands best chance discovering fact something complete work even slightly faster messing around diet counterintuitive may seem best thing save greatest number possibly sentient knows whats wasting time wild guesses might intelligent like house elves prepared food already regardless take onto plate harry considered moment rather seductive line reasoning good said slytherin glad see moral thing to sacrifice lives sentient beings convenience feed dreadful appetites sick pleasure ripping apart teeth harry thought indignantly side inner slytherin mental voice grim someday embrace doctrine end justifies meats followed mental snickering ever since harry started worrying plants might also sentient non ravenclaw components trouble taking moral caution seriously hufflepuff shouting cannibalism every time harry tried think food item whatsoever gryffindor would visualize screaming ate even say sandwich cannibalism aiiieeee eat ignore screams eat anyway safe place compromise ethics service higher goals everyone else thinks okay eat sandwiches use usual rationalization small probability large downside get caught harry gave mental

wanted anyone else know instant harry asked parseltongue professor quirrell would fix pale blue eyes say see mr potter taught mr malfoy patronus charm accidentally spoke snake matter enough evidence locate true explanation hypothesis let alone overcome burden prior improbability somehow defense professor would deduce anyway times harry suspected professor quirrell way background information telling priors simply good sometimes got amazing deductions right even reasons wrong problem harry see professor quirrell could snuck extra clue half stuff guessed harry would liked make sort incredible deduction something professor quirrell said would catch completely guard shall bowl green lentil soup soy sauce professor quirrell said waitress mr potter plate tenorman family chili harry

harry fault professor quirrell missed research turned old story mother goddess type could talk flying squirrels bit worried prospect eating something could talk harry took casual sip water professor quirrell said mr potter would correct guessing also parselmouth harry done coughing set glass water back table fixed gaze professor quirrell chin rather looking eyes said able perform legilimency occlumency barriers professor quirrell grinning widely shall take compliment mr potter buying anymore harry said way came conclusion based evidence course professor quirrell said equably planned ask question today case simply chose opportune moment suspected since december fact december said harry found yesterday ah realize sorting hat message parseltongue defense professor timed exactly right second time harry taking gulp water clear throat first coughing fit harry realized course obvious instant professor quirrell said right professor mcgonagall even told talk snakes anyone could see thought meant seen talking statues architectural features hogwarts looked like snakes double illusion transparency thought understood thought understood hell harry said performed legilimency first defense class find happened sorting hat would found december professor quirell leaned back smiling puzzle solve mr potter reveal answer winter holiday alerted fact headmaster filed request closed judicial panel review case one mr rubeus hagrid know keeper keys grounds hogwarts accused murder abigail myrtle 1943 oh course said harry makes downright obvious parselmouth professor sweet slithering snakes suspect murder slytherin monster legendary inhabitant slytherin chamber secrets certain sources alerted fact caught attention sufficiently spent good deal bribe money learn details case point fact mr potter mr hagrid innocent ridiculously obviously innocent blatantly innocent bystander convicted magical british legal system since grindelwald confunding neville chamberlain pinned amanda knox headmaster dippet prompted student puppet accuse mr hagrid dippet needed scapegoat take blame death miss myrtle marvelous justice system agreed plausible enough warrant mr hagrid expulsion snapping wand current headmaster needs merely provide new item evidence significant enough reconvene case dumbledore applying pressure instead dippet result foregone conclusion lucius malfoy particular reason fear mr hagrid vindication thus lucius malfoy resist extent costlessly order impose costs dumbledore dumbledore clearly willing prosecute case regardless professor quirrell took sip water digress new evidence headmaster promises provide exhibit previously undetected spell sorting hat headmaster asserts personally determined respond slytherins also parselmouths headmaster argues favors interpretation chamber secrets indeed opened 1943 approximately right time frame must named known parselmouth attended hogwarts rather questionable logic judicial panel may rule swings case far enough bring mr hagrid guilt doubt manage keep straight face say come key question headmaster discover hidden spell sorting hat professor quirrell smiling thinly well let us suppose parselmouth year crop students potential heir slytherin must admit mr potter stand possibility whenever extraordinary people considered ask new slytherin would likely mental privacy invaded headmaster specifically hunting memories sorting stand even smile vanished see mr potter invaded mind though ask apologize fault believed dumbledore protestations respecting mental privacy sincere apologies harry said keeping face expressionless rigid control confession right sweat beading forehead think defense professor would take evidence professor quirrell would think harry nervous discovered heir slytherin rather nervous professor quirrell might realize harry deliberately betrayed slytherin secret longer seeming like smart move mr potter progress finding chamber secrets thought harry maintain plausible deniability needed general policy sometimes evading questions even nothing hide respect professor quirrell made progress quite obvious tell professor quirrell sipped waterglass well mr potter shall freely tell know suspect first believe chamber secrets real slytherin monster miss myrtle death discovered hours demise even though wards alerted headmaster instantly therefore murder performed either headmaster dippet unlikely entity salazar slytherin keyed wards higher level headmaster second suspect contrary popular legend purpose slytherin monster rid hogwarts muggleborns unless slytherin monster powerful enough defeat headmaster hogwarts teachers could triumph force multiple murders secrecy would result school closure nearly happened 1943 placing new wards slytherin monster mr potter true purpose serve ah harry dropped gaze waterglass tried think kill anyone got chamber belong monster powerful enough defeat team wizards broken past best wards salazar could place chamber unlikely harry feeling bit pressured well called chamber secrets maybe monster secret secret matter sort secrets chamber secrets first place harry done lot research subject part gotten impression nobody knew anything professor quirrell smiling write secret ahhh said harry monster spoke parseltongue would ensure true descendant slytherin could hear secret easy enough key wards chamber phrase spoken parseltongue go trouble creating slytherin monster cannot easy create creature lifespan centuries come mr potter obvious secrets told one living mind another never written harry saw burst adrenaline started heart racing breath coming faster oh salazar slytherin cunning indeed cunning enough come way bypass interdict merlin powerful wizardries transmitted books ghosts could create long lived enough sentient creature good enough memory seems probable said professor quirrell must named began climb power secrets obtained slytherin monster salazar lost knowledge source know extraordinarily powerful wizardry hence interest chamber secrets case mr hagrid see harry said harry could find salazar chamber secrets lost knowledge lord voldemort obtained would well yes story go add harry superior intelligence original magical research muggle rocket launchers resulting fight would completely one sided exactly harry wanted harry grinning evil grin new priority find everything hogwarts looks remotely like snake try speaking starting everything already tried time sure use parseltongue instead english get draco let slytherin dorms become excited mr potter said professor quirrell face become expressionless must continue thinking dark lord parting words slytherin monster harry said could either us possibly know visualize scene mr potter let imagination fill details slytherin monster probably great serpent parselmouth may speak finished imparting knowledge possesses must named conveys salazar final benediction warns chamber secrets must remain closed next descendant salazar prove cunning enough open become dark lord nods says avada kedavra said harry suddenly feeling sick stomach rule twelve professor quirrell said quietly never leave source power lying around someone else find harry gaze dropped tablecloth decorated mournful pattern black flowers shadows somehow seemed sad imagined slytherin great snake wanted help lord voldemort lord voldemort something unbearably sorrowful sort person would offered nothing friendship think dark lord would yes professor quirrell said flatly must named left quite trail bodies behind mr potter doubt would omitted one artifacts left could moved dark lord would taken well might still something worth seeing chamber secrets find would prove true heir slytherin raise hopes high suspect find remains slytherin monster resting quietly grave sat silence could wrong said professor quirrell end guess wish warn mr potter would sorely disappointed harry nodded shortly one might even regret infant self victory said professor quirrell smile twisted know lived might persuaded teach knowledge would heritage one heir slytherin another smile twisted though mock obvious impossibility even given premise note self thought harry
